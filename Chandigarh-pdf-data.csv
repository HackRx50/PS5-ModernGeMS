When they reached near the Light Point of Sectors 46/47/48/49, Chandigarh at that time a car bearing registration No.HR-03L-1120 came at fast speed from their behind and struck against their Activa Honda. As a result of this accident the claimant and her friend both fell on the road along with their Activa Honda and received serious injuries. They were taken to hospital immediately. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of car bearing registration No.HR-03L-1120 driven by Sakun Ahmed @ Kaka respondent No.1 and Activa Honda bearing registration No.CH04A- 9562 driven by Ms.Chetna Anand respondent No.4. The claimant was not at all at fault being the pillion rider of the Activa Honda. FIR no.183 dated 3 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . 24.5.2013 u/s 279/337 of IPC was registered at Police Station Sector 31, Chandigarh. 3The claimant was 22 years of age at the time of accident, student of B.A.Ist year in Govt. College of Girls, Sector 11, Chandigarh. The claimant had participated in National School Games at Chandigarh and had also received various certificate and appreciations in the game of Baal Badminton. In the accident, the claimant suffered brain injury, right hemeparesis with ataxia and other multiple injuries. The doctors on duty in GMCH Sector 32, Chandigarh and Dhanwantri College & Hospital, Sector 46, Chandigarh attended the injured. The claimant is under treatment since the date of accident and spent a sum of Rs.3 lacs on her medical treatment so far. Rs.75 lacs has been claimed for the loss suffered due to permanent disability, loss of earning, loss of earning capacity, loss of future prospects, expenditure on medicine, conveyance and special diet, loss of social status, mental agony for pain & suffering past, present and future life, expenditure on attendant, loss of enjoyment of future life, entertainment of guests, marriage prospectus etc. 4Notice to respondents was issued. However, respondent No.1 did not appear despite service and was proceeded against ex parte. The remaining respondents appeared and contested the claim petition. Respondent no.2 filed written statement stating therein that the claimants have not attached any proof regarding the monthly income. It is submitted that the vehicle of respondent No.2 has been falsely involved by the claimant 4 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . just to create a ground for compensation etc. It is denied that the alleged accident had taken place with the vehicle of respondent No.2. It is submitted that false FIR has been lodged against the vehicle of respondent No.2 which has been lodged by the complainant in connivance with the police officials just to get compensation. Therefore, the present claim petition be dismissed with costs. 5Respondent No.3 filed written statement taking preliminary objections that the claim petition is vague, incomplete, does not disclose any cause of action and on this ground the claim petition is liable to be dismissed. The replying respondent takes up all the defences available under Section 147, 149, 157 and 170 of M.V .Act. It reserves its right to amend the pleadings if new facts come to the light during the pendency. No such accident took place with the alleged vehicle No.HR-03-L-1120. The respondent No.1 driver of the alleged offending vehicle was not driving the vehicle at the time of alleged accident and also was not having a valid and effective driving license and the owner was having knowledge of the same. In that case answering respondent is not liable to indemnify the owner even if the claimant proves to get any compensation. Respondent No.2 owner of the offending vehicle was not having valid RC, route permit and insurance policy, fitness certificate and respondent is not liable to indemnify the owner. 6While replying on merits it is submitted that no information about the alleged accident has been received from respondent No.2 as per the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. The amount claimed is 5 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . highly exaggerated. No such accident has ever taken place with the alleged vehicle. Rest of the averments are denied. It is alleged that the claim petition be dismissed against the replying respondent with heavy costs. 7.Respondent No.4 filed separate written statement admitting the accident but denied that she was at fault. It is submitted that the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of driver of vehicle No.HR- 03L-1120 alone.The claimant has falsely implicated the replying respondent in the present claim case and filed a false claim petition against her. It is only the driver of vehicle No.HR-03L-1120 who has caused the accident and alone is responsible for the same and a FIR was also registered on the complaint of replying respondent against the driver of vehicle No.HR-03L- 1120. Therefore, claim petition be dismissed with costs in the interest of justice. 8.Respondent No.5 filed similar and identical written statement as filed by respondent No.4. 9.Respondent No.6 filed written statement taking preliminary objection therein that the claim petition filed is incomplete, vague and does not disclosed any cause of action. The claim petition has been filed in contravention of the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The claimants are not entitled to any compensation under the M.V .Act or the law of Torts as the claimants have not suffered any monetary loss. The driver of Activa Honda registration No.CH-04-A-9562 was not holding a valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident. The respondent 6 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . takes up all the pleas available under Sections 147, 149, 157 and 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. 10.While replying on merits, it is submitted that the Activa Honda bearing registration No.CH-04-A-9562 was not insured with the answering respondent. In case the owner of the Activa Honda bearing registration No.CH-04-A-9562 produces the original policy of insurance then the answering respondent reserves its right to file the amended written statement. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. Therefore, the claim petition may be dismissed with costs. 11.From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed:- 1.Whether accident dated 13.5.2013 at about 2.30 PM resulting in juries to claimant Arti occurred on account of rash and negligent driving of vehicle No.HR-03-L-1120 by respondent No.1? OPP. 2 Whether the claimant is entitled to compensation for the injuries suffered in the accident, if so, to what extent and from whom? OPP. 3 Whether the driver of offending vehicle was not holding a valid effective driving license on the date of accident and the vehicle was being driven in violation of the terms and conditions of the insurance policy? OPR3. 4 Relief. 12.To substantiate their respective claims the parties led their evidence. 13The claimant examined two witness in all. The claimant herself stepped into the witness box as PW-1. Dr.Rajesh Chhabra, Department of 7 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . Neuro Surgery, PGI, Chandigarh & Member of Disability Board was examined as PW-2. Documents Ex P-1 to Ex P-132 were tendered in evidence. Thereafter, the evidence of the claimant was closed. 14On the other hand, respondent No.4 Chetna Anand herself apepared in the witness box as RW-1. Documents Ex.R1 & Ex.R2 tendered by respondents No.4 & 5. Ld.counsel for respondent No.2 tendered documents Ex.R2/1 to Ex.R2/3. Documents Ex.R3/1 & Ex.R3/2 were tendered by respondents No.3. Thereafter, evidence was closed by all the respondents. 15No rebuttal evidence was adduced by the claimants. 16The learned counsels for both the parties were heard. The issue wise findings with reasons thereof are as follows : ISSUE No. 1: 17To substantiate this issue, the learned counsel for the claimant argued that the accident took place due to composite negligence of respondents No.1 and respondent No.4 i.e. the driver of the offending car and Activa Honda respectively. The accident is well proved from the statement of PW1 Arti who is the claimant/eye witness and her statement is further corroborated by documentary evidence, the copy of FIR is on the record as Ex.P126 which proves the accident and the copy of the discharge and follow up card of the claimant is on the record as Ex.P1 which proves that she sustained injuries in the accident. Composite negligence is also 8 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . proved from the statement of PW1. 18.The learned counsel for the respondent no.2, on the other hand, opposed the arguments of learned counsel for the claimant. It is argued that from the evidence adduced by the claimant, the accident and rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 is not proved. In alternate it is argued that at the time of accident the respondent No.1 was having valid driving license, RC and insurance policy. 19.Learned counsel for respondent No.3 also argued on the same lines. Apart from that learned counsel argued that identification of respondent No.1 i.e. driver is not properly proved in the present matter. Though in the present matter claimant stated that the accident has taken place due to composite rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 but in the State case she and another eye witness Chetna have not identified the driver i.e. respondent No.1 and he has been acquitted by the learned Trial Court in that case for the said offence. The copy of the said judgment is on record as Ex.R3/1. The claimant has stated in her cross-examination before the learned Trail Court that she has not seen the accused which is well observed in the said judgment in para 8. The another witness of that case Chetna Anand supported the case of the prosecution in her examination-in- chief but in her cross-examination she stated that she cannot state who was driving the offending vehicle. This is also well observed in para 8 of the above said judgment, therefore, the said witness cannot be relied upon in 9 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . this matter. Hence, the accident and rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 is not proved. 20.Learned counsel for respondents No.4 & 5 argued that the rash and negligent driving of respondent No.4 is not proved in the present matter. PW1 Ms.Arti has admitted in her cross-examination that driver of the Activa respondent No.4 was not at fault. Moreover, the FIR is against the car driver and not against the driver of the Activa. In such circumstances the respondent No.4 is not liable for the accident. Even respondent No.4 Chetna Anand has appeared as RW1 and denied the accident by way of her rash and negligent driving and nothing otherwise could be extracted during her cross- examination. Therefore, her rash and negligent driving is not proved nor her rash and negligent driving by way of composite negligence is proved. 21. Learned counsel for respondent No.6 also argued on the same line as that of respondents No.4 & 5. He also stated that in view of cross-examination of PW1 the rash and negligent driving of respondent No.4 is not proved and her composite negligence is also not proved. 22.The learned counsel for the claimant rebutted the arguments advanced by learned counsel for respondents. It is argued that PW1 Arti was not confronted with her previous statement, therefore, the said statement is not binding on her. In support of his arguments learned counsel relied upon the law laid down by Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in case titled as Sukhjit Singh Vs. Dharampal and other FAO No.1305 of 1992 (O&M) decided on 27.1.2011. Moreover, the judgment of acquittal passed by 10 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . learned Trial Court is not binding on this Court. In support of his arguments learned counsel relied upon the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as Dulcina Fernandes & ors. Vs. Joaquim Xavier Cruz & anr. 2013(4) RCR (Civil)(SC) 751 and law laid down by Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in case titled as Bagga Vs. Smt.Manjeet Kaur and others FAO-6381-2011(O&M) decided on 7.3.2014. Therefore, the accident and rash and negligent driving is well proved. 23The arguments advanced by learned counsel for both the sides are duly considered apart from perusing the record. As far as the accident is concerned, the accident is proved in the present case from the statement of PW1 Ms.Arti. Her statement is supported by document also as FIR was lodged after the accident the copy of which is Ex.P126. Apart from that RW1 has also admitted the accident though she stated that the accident has not taken place due to her rash and negligent driving. In such circumstances from the evidence available on the record the accident is well proved. Apart from that the accident and rash and negligent driving is to be proved beyond reasonable doubt in criminal trial only. In the civil matters, like claim petitions, the accident and rash and negligent can be proved with the help of preponderance of probabilities also. Reliance in this regard can be given of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in case titled as Kusum Lata and others Vs. Satbir and others, 2011(4) LJR 512. 24.Now it is to be seen that whether the accident has taken place due to composite rash and negligent driving of respondents No.1 & 4. In this 11 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . regard this Tribunal is of the view that as regard to composite negligence the claimant is maily relying upon the statement of PW1 Ms.Arti. In her cross- examination she has well admitted that respondent No.4 was not at fault and accident has taken place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. There is no other evidence on record to prove the composite negligence. In such circumstances, the composite negligence is not proved rather it is made out that the accident has taken place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. 25.Now the objection of learned counsel for respondent No.2 is that in the State case PW1 has not identified the driver and stated that she does not know who was driving the car. RW1 Arti has also deposed in her statement in that case that she has not seen the driver. In such circumstances learned counsel alleged that the identity of the driver is not proved. In this regard this Tribunal is of the view that the present petition is to be decided as per evidence adduced in the present petition and as per evidence adduced in the present petition, identity of respondent No.1 is well proved from the statement of PW1 Arti and FIR Ex.P126 . Moreover, she is not confronted with her previous statement. In such circumstances, she is to be relied upon. Reliance in this regard can be placed on the law laid down by Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in case titled as Sukhjit Singh Vs. Dharampal and other FAO No.1305 of 1992 (O&M) decided on 27.1.2011. Moreover, the judgment of acquittal passed by learned Trial Court is not binding on this Court. Reliance in this regard can also be placed on the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as Dulcina 12 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . Fernandes & ors. Vs. Joaquim Xavier Cruz & anr. 2013(4) RCR (Civil) (SC) 751 and law laid down by Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in case titled as Bagga Vs. Smt.Manjeet Kaur and others FAO-6381- 2011(O&M) decided on 7.3.2014. Therefore, the accident by way of rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 is well established. 26 In view of above discussion, issue No. 1 is decided in favour of claimant. ISSUE NO. 2 : 27To substantiate this issue, the learned counsel for the claimant has pressed that the claimant has suffered 50% disability which is permanent and functional disability, therefore, it is to be treated as 100% and compensation may be assessed by using multiplier. In support of his arguments learned counsel relied upon the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as Rekha Jain Vs. National Insurance Co. Ltd. 2013(3) RCR (Civil)(SC) 996. As far as income of the injured is concerned, she was a student and her income is to be assessed at the rate of Rs.10,000/- per month. In support of his arguments, the ld. Counsel relied upon the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as V . Mekala vs. M. Malathi and another 2014(2) RCR (Civil) 880. She is entitled for future prospects also. The claimant is entitled for future medical expenses also. In support of his arguments learned counsel relied upon the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as Kavita Vs. Deepak and others 2012(4) RCR(Civil) (SC) 273 . Compensation under 13 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . usual heads may be granted. 28. Learned counsel for respondents on the other hand opposed the arguments. It is argued that the disability has been assessed as 50% and it is to be taken as 50% only or less than 50% as it is not functional disability. The multiplier method cannot be used. The medical expenses could not be proved by the claimants, therefore, the claimant is not entitled for any compensation. 29.The arguments advanced by learned counsel for both the sides are duly considered apart from perusing the record. As far as the income of the claimant is concerned there is nothing on the record to establish the income of the claimant. Learned counsel for the claimant is pressing to assess the income of the claimant as Rs.10,000/- in view of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in V .Mekala's case (supra). In this regard this Tribunal is of the view in that case the injured was a professional degree holder while it is not so in the present case. The injured was not professional degree holder in the present matter, however, she is stated to be 22 years old at the time of accident, therefore, her income is to be assessed as per collector rate i.e. at the rate Rs.7500/- per month. The annual income comes to the tune of Rs.90,000/-. As far as disability is concerned it is described as 50% permanent disability as the right side of the body of the claimant has been affected. She will be having difficulty while using right hand and she requires a continuous physiotherapy. In such circumstances the functional disability is assessed as 60%. Reliance in this regard can be given of the law 14 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Rekha Jain's case (supra). She is entitled compensation for loss of income, accordingly it comes to the tune of Rs.90,000x60/100=Rs.54,000/- per annum. Keeping in view her age in view of the law laid down in Smt. Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Anr., 2009(3) RCR (Civil), 77 , the multiplier of 18 is to be applied. In this way she is entitled for compensation to the tune of Rs.54000x18=9,72,000/-. As far as future prospects is concerned, the claimant has claimed the future prospectus @ 50%. She is entitled for the same in view of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in V . Mekala vs. M. Malathi and another 2014(2) RCR (Civil) 880 as she was 22 years old at the time of accident. Therefore, 50% future prospectus of the injured comes to the tune of Rs.4,86,000/-. 30The medical bills have been placed on record from Ex.P46 to Ex.P125 for the amount of Rs.84,337/-. The claimant is entitled for the same. Besides that, the claimant is also entitled for future medical expenses particularly for physiotherapy amounting to Rs.2,00,000/-. Reliance in this regard can be given of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kavita's case (supra). The marriage prospects of claimant have diminished and as such she is entitled compensation for loss of marriage prospects to the tune of Rs.1,00,000/-. The claimant is entitled for Rs.50,000/- for pain & suffering. She is also entitled for loss of opportunities to the tune of Rs.50,000/-. Rs.50,000/- are assessed for hospitalization & healthy diet. In this way, the claimant is entitled for the following expenses:- 15 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . Loss of future income = Rs.9,72,000/- Future prospectus (50%) = Rs.4,86,000/- Medical Expenses = Rs.84,337/- Future Physiotherapy expenses = Rs.2,00,000/- Marriage prospects =Rs.1,00,000/- Pain & suffering = Rs.50,000/- Hospitalization & Healthy diet = Rs.50,000/- Loss of opportunity =Rs.50,000/- _____________ Total = Rs.19,92,337/- _____________ 31The total amount comes to the tune of Rs.19,92,337/- i.e. Rs. Rs.19,93,000/- when taken in round figure. The claimant is entitled for the same. The claimant is entitled for interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the realization of the whole of this amount. 32 As far as liability is concerned, it has been held that respondent No.1 was rash and negligent in driving car No.HR-03L-1120. The offending car was owned by respondent No.2 and was insured with respondent No.2. As such, the liability to make the payment is joint and several of the respondents no.1 to 3. However, the insurance company i.e. respondent no.3 is required to make the payment as vehicle in question was insured one vide insurance policy Ex.2/1-Ex.3/2 and respondent No.3 is bound to indemnify the respondent no.2, the owner of the vehicle in 16 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . question. 33 In view of above discussion, issue no. 2 is decided in favour of claimant accordingly. ISSUE NO. 3: 34This issue was not specifically pressed at the time of arguments. However, otherwise also there is nothing on record to prove this issue and the copy of driving license of respondent no.1 has been placed on record as Ex.2/3. Therefore, this issue is decided against the respondent no.3. RELIEF: 35. In view of above discussion, it is held that the claimant is entitled for compensation and an award of Rs.19,93,000/- (Rs.Ninteen lacs ninty three thousand only) is hereby passed in favour of claimant and against the respondents no.1 to 3 jointly and severally along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the realization of the whole of this amount. However, the insurance company i.e . respondent No.3 is required to make the payment as vehicle in question was insured one. 36The half amount of compensation of claimant shall be deposited in the bank account of the claimant on submitting copy of pass book. The half amount of compensation of claimant shall be deposited in the 17 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . form of FDR in her name in any nationalized bank of her choice for a period of one year.

Shri ML Chaudhary, counsel for respondent No.3. A W A R D:- Claimant by way of the present petition is claiming compensation on account of injuries sustained by him in a motor vehicle Atul Kasana Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. Jatinder Kumar versus Gurdeep 2 accident. 2It is alleged that on 27.6.2015, at about 10.00 am, the claimant was going from Golumajra to Dappar while driving his motorcycle at slow speed on the left side of the road and Harchand and Suresh Kumar were the other occupants of the motorcycle. When they reached near Toll Plaza, Village Dappar, at that time a car bearing No.CH03-N-7414 came from their behind at fast speed and struck against the motorcycle, as a result of which they all fell down on the road and sustained serious injuries. It was further averred that they all were taken to Civil Hospital, Derabassi immediately. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and a criminal case was got registered against respondent no.1 for causing the accident in question. The claimant is claiming compensation to the tune of Rs.30 lacs under various heads and prayed that compensation be awarded along with interest @ 12% per annum from the date of petition till realization of the amount. 3Upon notice, respondent no.1 filed written statement denying the accident. It was submitted that claimant had met with accident with some other vehicle and the vehicle of the answering respondent has been falsely involved just to claim compensation. A false FIR has been registered against respondent No.1 in connivance with police officials. Rather, he was driving the car at normal speed with proper care and caution and since no accident took place with the vehicle in question, therefore, there is no question of claimant sustaining injuries Atul Kasana Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. Jatinder Kumar versus Gurdeep 3 as a result thereof as is alleged. Rest of the facts have been denied and prayer for dismissal of petition was made. Respondent No.2 has also filed written statement on the same lines as is filed by respondent No.1. 4In the written statement filed by respondent no.3-insurance company, it is alleged that no cause of action has arisen in favour of claimant as against the answering respondent as nothing has been alleged to have occurred against it and as such, the petition deserves dismissal; that driver of the car in question was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of taking place of accident; the petition is bad for non-joinder of necessary parties; the insured has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, so the answering respondent is not liable to indemnify him. Further it reserves its right to take all the pleas available under section 147, 148 of the Motor Vehicles Act. It was further submitted that in case the Courts comes to a conclusion that the accident took place with the car in question, even the driver of the car in question alone cannot be held responsible for the cause of alleged accident as the claimant/motorcyclist himself is equally negligent and responsible for the alleged accident as he was driving the motorcycle without taking care of traffic rules and traffic on the road. Three persons were sitting on the motorcycle, which is a clear violation of traffic rules and resulted in accident. Rest of the facts as mentioned in claim petition were denied and prayer was made that the petition be dismissed. 5From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed.

On the other hand, respondents no.1 and 2 closed their evidence after tendering driving licence of respondent no.1 and registration certificate and insurance policy of offending vehicle. Counsel for respondent no.3 also closed his evidence after tendering insurance policy. 7I have heard counsel for the parties and perused the record with their assistance. My issue wise findings are as under. Issue No.1. 8To prove this issue, there is on record the statement of Jatinder claimant-injured and he while appearing in the court as PW1, has deposed that on 27.6.2015, at about 10.00 am, he was going from Golumajra to Dappar while driving his motorcycle at slow speed on the left side of the road and Harchand and Suresh Kumar were the other occupants of the motorcycle. When they reached near Toll Plaza, Village Dappar, at that time a car bearing No.CH03-N-7414 came from backside Atul Kasana Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. Jatinder Kumar versus Gurdeep 5 at fast speed and struck against the motorcycle, as a result of which they all fell down on the road and sustained serious injuries. He further deposed that they all were taken to Civil Hospital, Derabassi immediately and that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. A criminal case was got registered against respondent no.1 for causing the accident in question on the basis of his statement. Copy of FIR in this respect is proved as Ex.P7. Respondents No.1 and 2 have also failed to give any plausible explanation regarding the involvement of respondent no.1 as driver and vehicle in question in the accident in question falsely and have further failed to rebut the evidence of claimants to the contrary. Had it been so, it would have been very natural for respondents No.1 and 2 to move any representation to any authority regarding the false implication of respondent no.1 and the vehicle in the accident in question. This also lends credence to the version of the claimant. FIR has admittedly been registered against respondent No.1, which is another circumstance which goes against respondent No.1. 9It was the plea of the counsel for the insurance company that the claimant was also at fault and he was also driving the motorcycle with two persons as pillion riders, which was in direct contravention of the Motor Vehicle rules and thus, if accident was held to be proved, it was a case of contributory negligence. This contention has no force. No doubt, it is an admitted case of the claimant that two persons were pillion rider on the motrcycle being driven by him, however, this fact in itself Atul Kasana Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. Jatinder Kumar versus Gurdeep 6 does not give rise to an inference that the accident was also due to contributory negligence of the claimant. There is nothing on record to show that the claimant in any manner contributed in the causing of the accident or that three person riding the motorcycle, was the cause of the accident. So, in these circumstances, after evaluating whatever evidence has come on record from both the sides in this respect, it is held that the claimant has proved that the accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. Accordingly, issue no.1 is decided in favour of claimant and against the respondent. Issue No.2 9The question to be decided under this issue is as to what extent the claimant is entitled to compensation. In the present case, the claimant was 31 years of age at the time of accident. It has been claimed that due to the accident the claimant suffered fracture of right leg and other multiple injuries. He further claimed that he had spent an amount of Rs.70,000 on his treatment. He has spent an amount of Rs.19,293/- towards the expenses incurred on purchase of medicines and also had to spent a sum of Rs. 20,000/- on special diet. It was also claimed that due to the accident, till date the deponent was unable to work and earn anything and remained on bed for a period of 6 months. 10As per Ex.P1 the claimant remained hospitalized at Civil Hospital, Derabassi from 27.6.2015 to 15.7.2015 i.e for about 19 days and he has suffered a fracture of right femur and thereafter was a follow up patient as is clear from Ex.P6. So far as the other compensation, this Atul Kasana Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. Jatinder Kumar versus Gurdeep 7 Tribunal can very well take notice that the claimant remained hospitalized for 19 days. Thus, he definitely must have incurred extra expenditure on special diet as well as an attendant. As such, the claimant is held entitled to a sum of Rs.1000/- on account of special diet and attendant charges for 19 days. However, it can well be presumed that even after discharge from the hospital, the claimant would have been confined to bed for another three months and would have required the services of attendant as well as special diet during the said period, as has also been stated by PW Dr Ravi Kumar Preenja. No evidence has come on record as regards hiring of such an attendant. Thus, this Tribunal deems it appropriate to award Rs.5000/- per month towards attendant charges and Rs.5000/- per month towards special diet for a period of three months and on this count, he is further held entitled to Rs.30,000/-. He is also awarded another sum of Rs.7500/- towards conveyance expenses, which must have been incurred on account of his being taken to hospital and brought forth. This Tribunal can well take notice of pain and sufferings undergone by the claimant at the age of 31 years and it is also to be kept in mind that at such a young age he had to undergo the mental trauma and he is further held entitled to Rs.20,000/- on account of pain and sufferings. The claimant has proved on record the medical bills Ex.P8 to Ex.P18, amounting to Rs.19,293 and he is entitled to the same. 11As far as the loss of income is concerned, the claimant has stated on oath that his right leg was operated and rod was affixed and that he was working as Raj Mistri and was earning Rs.15,000/- per month and Atul Kasana Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. Jatinder Kumar versus Gurdeep 8 due to accident he had to remain on bed for six months and till date he is unable to work and earn anything. Keeping in view the injury sustained, it can be well presumed that the claimant would have been unable to attend work for at-least three months, as the expert PW Dr. Ravi Kumar Preenja has also stated that it takes about 3-4 months for these type of fractures to unite and the claimant is to be compensated for the said period. As far as the claimant being employed as Raj Mistri, no evidence has come on record to support the above contention and as such, his income is taken to be that of a unskilled labourer, which at the given point of time was around 7940/- per month as per minimum wages prevalent and the loss of income comes to Rs.23,820/-, to which he is held entitled. 12As per Exhibit P19, the permanent disability of the claimant has been assessed to the extent of 15% in relation to right lower limb and not qua his whole body and thus, the said 15% permanent disability, when taken for the whole body would stand reduced to the extent of 7.5%, keeping in view the nature of injury and all the factors effecting his earnings and result of the disability on his working capabilities. As per PW Dr. Ravi Kumar Preenja who assessed and issued disability certificate Ex.P19, it was a functional disability and there was stiffness of right hip with difficulty in squatting and cross legged sitting. It was held in case titled as Raj Kumar versus Ajay Kumar and Another , reported in 2011(1) SCC 343, by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that, 'Where the claimant suffers a permanent disability as Atul Kasana Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. Jatinder Kumar versus Gurdeep 9 a result of injuries, the assessment of compensation under the head of loss of future earnings would depend upon the effect and impact of such permanent disability on his earning capacity. The Tribunal should not mechanically apply the percentage of permanent disability as the percentage of economic loss or loss of earning capacity. What requires to be assessed by the Tribunal is the effect of permanent disability on the earning capacity of the injured; and after assessing the loss of earning capacity in terms of percentage of the income, it has to be quantified in terms of money, to arrive at the future loss of earnings(by applying the standard multiplier method used to determine loss of dependency)'. Thus, the claimant is found entitled to compensation further on account of suffering disability of 15%. The same being of right lower limb would definitely hamper in his daily functioning and his performing his work. However, while computing the loss, it is to be kept in mind that the same was not qua the complete body but qua the right lower limb only to the extent of 15% and the same has been assessed at 7.5% in relation to the complete body. The loss of future income has to be calculated accordingly. The income of the claimant at the time of the accident has been assessed at Rs.7940/- per month. The monthly future loss of income in view of the assessed disability of 7.5% comes to Rs.1191/- and the yearly loss comes to Rs.14,292/-. The multiplier to be adopted is 16, keeping in view the age of the claimant, which is 36 years, as is from the medical record on file and the future loss of earnings thus, Atul Kasana Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. Jatinder Kumar versus Gurdeep 10 comes to Rs.2,28,672/- and the claimant is held entitled to the same accordingly. The claimant is further found entitled to compensation on count of loss of amenities as he has suffered disability of 15%. He is thus, entitled to Rs.20,000/- on this count. The claimant is thus found to be entitled to the following amount:- Sr.No Particulars Amount 1.Hospitalization charges, treatment expenses and expenses incurred on medicinesRs.19293/- 2.Special Diet & attendant charges Rs.49,000/- 3.Transportation charges Rs.7500/- 4.Pains & sufferings Rs.20,000/- 5.Loss of income Rs.23,820/- 6.Future loss of income Rs.2,28,672/- 7.Loss of amenities Rs.20,000/- Total Rs.3,68,285/- 15The accident has been duly proved and the involvement of the respondent No.1 being driver car No.CH03-N-7414 also stands duly proved. The vehicle is owned by respondent No.2 and insured by respondent No.3. Accordingly, it is held that claimant is entitled to compensation of above sum and the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the same to the claimant. Accordingly, issue No.2 stands decided in favor of claimant and against the respondents. Issue No.3. 16Learned counsel for respondent No.3 argued that respondent no.1 was not holding a valid licence and as such the insurance company Atul Kasana Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. Jatinder Kumar versus Gurdeep 11 is not liable to indemnify him. However, the respondent no.3 has not led any evidence in this regard nor has disputed the genuineness of the licence which is Ex.R1 on file. Perusal of the driving licence which is Ex.R1 on court file, reveals respondent no.1 was holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident as it was issued on 9.2.2015 and is valid till 9.4.2021. As such, this issue is decided in favour of respondent No.1 and against respondent no.3. Relief. 17Keeping in view my findings on the above issues, this claim petition is allowed to the extent that an award of Rs. 3,68,285/- is passed in favour of the claimant and against the respondents. This amount of compensation will be paid by the respondents jointly and severally along with interest at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of filing of petition till date of realization.

A criminal case was registered against its driver for causing this accident on the basis of the statement of Sh.Jaimal Singh. 3.The deceased was 42 years old at the time of accident, working as Painter and earning Rs.20,000/- per month. The claimants spent on funeral expenses and performing last rites of the deceased. They have suffered huge loss due to the untimely death of the deceased, therefore, they need immediate financial help as they all were dependent on the income of the deceased. Rs.50 lacs along with interest @ 12% per annum have been claimed for untimely death of the deceased, loss of love & affection to the claimants, future prospects, loss of consortium to widow, loss to the estate, funeral expenses etc. 4.Notice was issued to respondents and respondents No.1 to 3 appeared in response of notice. Respond ent No.1 is stated to be died and his son Sushil Joshi was impleaded as his legal heir who filed written statement taking preliminary objections that Sh.Varinder Dev Joshi expired on 14.9.2012 and the petition for compensation has been 4 Nek Wati & others vs. Varinder & Ors . filed arising out of accident which is alleged to have taken place on 28.4.2015. On the date of accident Sh.Varinder Joshi was not alive and moreso vehicle No.CH-04-C-3684 had been sold to respondent No.2 namely Kamma Kaushal wife of Anil Bhonsle r/o H.No.2008/25, Sector 32-c, Chandigarh on 14.3.2015. The possession of the vehicle has been delivered to the said purchaser on 14.3.2015 by Sh.Sushil Joshi being legal heir of Sh.Varinder Dev Joshi. The legal heir who has been added in place of respondent No.1 is not liable to pay any amount of compensation to the petitioner/claimants as on the date of accident i.e. 28.4.2015 respondent No.1 was not alive and even otherwise the vehicle has been sold by the legal heirs after his death on 14.3.2015 to Kamna Kaushal wife of Anil Bhonsle. 5.The claim petition has been earlier instituted against dead person i.e. Sh.Varinder Dev Joshi which is not maintainable and the claim petition should be dismissed on this account alone. Respondent No.2 has given an affidavit duly attested by Notary while taking possession of the vehicle and in the affidavit she has clearly stated that she was in possession of the vehicle with all original documents vide receipt dated 14.3.2015 which has been executed between respondent No.2 and Sh.Sushil Joshi. Respondent No.2 has specifically mentioned in the affidavit that if any sort of challan, accident, tax and court case arises after the date 14.3.2015 then respondent No.2 will be responsible for the same as she was in possession of the said vehicle so on the date 5 Nek Wati & others vs. Varinder & Ors . of accident dated 28.4.2015 respondent No.2 who purchased the vehicle was in possession of the vehicle and accident if any occurred with the vehicle when she had already purchased the same w.e.f. 14.3.2015. 6.While replying on merits it is submitted that the claimant has not spent a sum of Rs.50,000/- on funeral expenses and performing last rites of the deceased. Respondent No.1 had already sold the vehicle to respondent No.2 on 14.3.2015 and possession of the same has been delivered to respondent No.2. Respondent No.1 was not owner of the vehicle on the date of alleged accident i.e. 28.4.2015. Denying remaining averments prayer for dismissal of the claim petition has been made. 7.Respondent No.2 filed separate written statement taking preliminary objections regarding maintainability and suppression of material facts. It is submitted that the legal heir of respondent No.1 cheated respondent No.2 by selling out their vehicle knowing very well that the registration of the same cannot be transferred further. It is pertinent to mention that on the one hand the legal heirs of respondent No.1 giving affidavit regarding transfer of ownership in there name and on the other hand they sold out the vehicle to the answering respondent without getting it transfer in their names. The legal heirs of respondent No.1 never handed over any documents relating to vehicle in question. It is only after the complaint made by the husband of answering respondent during inquiry they handed over the copy of death 6 Nek Wati & others vs. Varinder & Ors . certificate, affidavits of legal heirs and copy of RC to answering respondent. The affidavit dated 25.7.2015 has been taken by the LRs of respondent No.1 under duress just to save them from their liability after taking legal advise. The legal heirs of respondent No.1 cheated the answering respondent in connivance with one car dealer namely Sh.Tarik Mehta without disclosing the facts that the vehicle in question cannot be transferred in the name of answering respondent as the registered owner i.e. respondent No.1 had expired long back on 14.9.2012. They also ensured the respondent No.2 that they will transfer the vehicle in question in her name but after taking Rs.3 lacs from respondent No.2 they never turned up to fulfill their promise, having no option left with the husband of respondent but to make a complaint against Sh.Sushil Joshi who is the son of respondent No.1 and the car dealer namely Sh.Tarik Mehta to the SSP, Chandigarh on 8.7.2015. 8. While replying on merits, it is submitted that false FIR has been got registered against the husband of respondent No.2 in order to get the claim. The claimant has not spent a sum of Rs.50,000/- on funeral expenses and performing last rites of the deceased. The claimants are not entitled for claiming an amount of Rs.50 lacs on account of compensation arising out of accident and the answering respondent is not liable to pay the amount as alleged. It is alleged that the claim petition be dismissed with costs. 7 Nek Wati & others vs. Varinder & Ors . 9.Respondent No.3 filed separate written statement on the same lines as that of respondent No.2 and dismissal of the petition is prayed. 10.From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed vide order dated 17.3.2017:- 1. Whether the accident dated 28.4.2015 at about 1.00 PM resulting in death of Pannu Lal occurred on account of rash and negligent driving of vehicle No.CH-04-C-3684 by respondent No.3? OPP 2. Whether the claimants are entitled to compensation for death of Pannu Lal, if so, to what extent and from whom? OPP. 3. Whether the petition is not maintainable? OPR. 4 Relief. 11.To substantiate their respective claims the parties led their evidence. 12.The claimants have examined two witnesses in all. The claimant No.1 Smt.Nek Wati, herself stepped into the witness box as PW1. Claimants examined Kumar Pal @ Kunwar Pal, who is the eye witness of accident as PW2. Documents Ex.P1 to Ex.P8 were tendered in evidence. Thereafter, the evidence of the claimants was closed. 13.On the other hand, Sushil Joshi, LR of respondent No.1 himself appeared in the witness box as RW1. Respondent No.2 & 3 examined Constable Ajay Singh who has brought record of complaint 8 Nek Wati & others vs. Varinder & Ors . filed before SSP as RW2. Respondent No.3 Anil Kumar himself appeared in the witness box as RW3. Respondent No.2 Kamna Kaushal herself appeared in the witness box as RW4. Document Ex.R1 to Ex.R3 were tendered in evidence on behalf of respondents No.1 and 2 and thereafter they closed their evidence. Documents Ex.RX, Ex.R2/A to Ex.R2/C, Ex.RW3/A & Ex.RW3/B were tendered in evidence by respondent No.3. Thereafter, evidence of respondent No.3 was closed. 14.No rebuttal evidence was adduced by the claimants. 15.The learned counsels for both the parties were heard. The issue wise findings with reasons thereof are as follows : ISSUE No. 1: 16.To substantiate this issue, the learned counsel for the claimant argued that from the statement of PW2 Kumar Pal @ Kunwar Pal, who was eye witness, the accident by way of rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 and the death of deceased Pannu Lal are well proved. The oral testimony of witness is further supported by the documentary evidence also. The copy of PMR is on the record as Ex.P1 and the copy of FIR is on the record is Ex.P8. In this way, the accident due to rash and negligent driving of Anil Bhosle respondent No.3 and the death of Pannu Lal in the accident are well proved. 17.The learned counsel for the respondent No.1 on the other 9 Nek Wati & others vs. Varinder & Ors . hand opposed the arguments. Learned counsel argued that the claimants failed to prove the accident by way of rash and negligent driving of Anil Bhosle and the death of Pannu Lal in the alleged accident by way of evidence adduced by them. The accident, if any, has taken place due to the negligence of the deceased himself. 18.The learned counsel for respondents No.2 and 3 argued on same lines. It is further argued by learned counsel that the statement of PW2 can not be relied upon as he is the relative of the deceased. The version given by the witness is concocted. He is a projected witness and he can not be relied upon. The lodging of FIR against Anil Bhosle is not sufficient to prove the rash and negligent driving. Hence, the rash and negligent driving of respondent No.3 is not established. In this way, the claimants failed to prove the accident, the rash and negligent driving of respondent No.3 and death of Pannu Lal by way of accident. 19. The arguments advanced by learned counsel for both the sides are duly considered apart from perusing the record. PW2 Kumar Pal @ Kunwar Pal, who is eye witness has well deposed in his statement that on 28.04.2015 at about 11.30 AM he was going on the road leading from village Jagatpura to Phase XI Mohali while sitting on a cycle which was being paddled by his uncle Sh.Jaimal Singh at slow speed and on the left side of the road. His father Sh.Pannu Lal was going ahead of him while paddling a separate cycle. When they had covered 200 yards from Jagatpura towards Phase XI, Mohali at that time a Tata 10 Nek Wati & others vs. Varinder & Ors . Safari bearing registration No.CH-04-C-3684 came at fast speed from their behind and after overtaking their cycle it struck against the cycle of the deceased. As a result of this accident his father fell on the road and received serious injuries. He was taken to GMCH, Sector 32, Chandigarh immediately where he died on the same day. The aforesaid Safari was being driven at fast speed and in a rash and negligent manner by its driver. The accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of Tata Safari bearing registration No.CH-04-C-3684 driven by its driver. Later on he had come to know the name of the driver as Sh.Anil Bhosle. His father was not at all at fault. A criminal case was registered against its driver for causing this accident on the basis of the statement of Sh.Jaimal Singh. 20.Nothing otherwise could be extracted during his cross- examination. From his statement, rash and negligent driving of respondent No.3 the accident and the death of Pannu Lal in the accident are well proved. He can not be disbelieved merely on the ground that he was son of the deceased as his confidence could not be shaken during the cross-examination. His statement is corroborated by documentary evidence also. The copy of PMR is on the record as Ex.P1 and the copy of FIR is on the record as Ex.P8. These documents are very strong corroborative piece of evidence. The statement of PW2 corroborated by these documents, is sufficient to prove the rash and negligent driving, accident and death of Pannu Lal in the accident. 11 Nek Wati & others vs. Varinder & Ors . Apart from that the accident and rash and negligent driving is to be proved beyond reasonable doubt in criminal trial only. In the civil matters, like claim petitions, the accident and rash and negligent can be proved with the help of preponderance of probabilities also. Reliance in this regard can be given of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in case titled as Kusum Lata and others Vs. Satbir and others, 2011(4) LJR 512. Hence the rash and negligent driving, the accident and death of Pannu Lal in the accident are well proved. 21. In view of above discussion, issue No.1 is hereby decided in favour of claimants. ISSUE NO. 2 : 22. To substantiate this issue, the learned counsel for the claimants argued that the deceased was working as Painter and was earning about Rs.20,000/- per month. In alternate it is alleged that if this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the income is not properly proved due to want of documents then the income of the deceased be taken at collector rate treating him as skilled labourer and compensation may be assessed accordingly. Apart from that the claimants are entitled for compensation for future prospects, loss of estate and cremation expenses and compensation may be granted accordingly. 23.The learned counsel for respondent No.1, on the other hand, opposed the arguments. It is stated that the income is not proved, 12 Nek Wati & others vs. Varinder & Ors . therefore, the claimants are not entitled for any claim. 24.Learned counsel for respondent No.2 and 3 also argued on the same lines and stated that except from the self serving oral statement of PW1 there is no corroborative evidence in the form of document to establish the income of the deceased. Hence, the income is not established and the claimants are not entitled for any compensation. 25. The arguments advanced by ld counsel for both the side are duly considered part from perusing the record. As far as the age of the deceased is concerned he is alleged to be 42 years old at the time of accident. In the PMR the age is mentioned as 40 years. However, in the aadhar card the year of birth of deceased is mentioned as 1971 as per which he was about 44 years old at time of accident. As such his age is considered as 44 years at the time of accident. As far as the income of the deceased is concerned, it is alleged in the petition that he was Painter and earning Rs.20,000/- per month but there is nothing on record that record to establish his income. Further there is no cogent evidence to establish that he was a skilled painter apart from oral averment of witness i.e. PW1. As such hi s income is to be assessed at collector rate. Keeping in view the minimum wages for a daily wager and other facts of availability of work etc. , a sum of Rs.8000/- per month is taken as monthly income of the deceased at the time of accident. His annual income comes to Rs.8000/-x12=Rs.96,000/-. As far as deduction is concerned, the main dependents are his wife and five 13 Nek Wati & others vs. Varinder & Ors . children, therefore, deduction should be 1/4th. In this way the income which he was giving to his family for the purpose of compensation comes to the tune of Rs.96,000/- (-) Rs.24,000/-=Rs.72000/- The deceased was 44 years old at the time of accident, therefore, the multiplier of 14 is to be applied in view of the law laid down by Smt. Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Anr., 2009(3) RCR (Civil), 77. The amount of claim comes to the tune of Rs.72,000x14=Rs.10,08,000/-. The claimants are entitled for 25% increase as future prospects in view of the law laid down in law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as National Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Pranay Sethi and others Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.25590 of 2014 decided on 31.10.2017 , which comes to Rs.2,52,000/-. In view of the above law the claimants are entitled for expenses incurred on cremation to the tune of Rs.15,000/-. Apart from that, claimant No.1 is entitled to consortium to Rs.40,000/-. Claimants 2 to 6 are entitled to Rs.15,000/- as loss of estate . In this way, the claimants are entitled for Rs.10,08,000/- + Rs.2,52,000/-+ Rs.15,000/- + Rs.40,000/- + Rs.15,000/-= Rs.13,30,000/-. The claimants are also entitled for interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the realization of the whole of this amount. 26.As far as liability to pay the compensation is concerned learned counsel for the claimants argued that the liability to pay the compensation is joint and several of all the respondents. Learned 14 Nek Wati & others vs. Varinder & Ors . counsel submitted that respondent No.1 is liable being legal heir of registered owner of the vehicle and respondent No.2 is liable being the purchaser/subsequent owner of the vehicle and respondent No.3 is liable as driver. Learned counsel for respondent submitted that liability of registered owner and subsequent owner is given co-extensive. In support of his arguments learned counsel relied upon the law laid down by Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled as Pushpa @ Leela & ors. Vs. Shkuntala & ors. 2011 AIR (SC) 682 . 27. Respondent No.1 has already sold the vehicle to respondent No.2 on 14.3.2015 being legal heir of Varinder Dev Joshi while the accident took place on 28.4.2015. The selling of the vehicle and purchasing of the vehicle is not disputed in the present matter and respondent No.1 is not liable in any manner to make the payment of compensation. 28. Learned counsel for respondents No.2 and 3 argued that respondent No.3 is not liable to make the payment of compensation as respondent No.2 was not registered owner of the vehicle at the date of incident. It is alleged that only registered owner is liable to make the payment and not the subsequent purchaser. Similarly, the driver is also not liable to make any payment and it is only the registered owner who is liable to make the payment. 29. The arguments advanced by learned counsel for both 15 Nek Wati & others vs. Varinder & Ors . the sides are duly considered apart from perusing the record. As far as ownership of the vehicle is concerned it is well proved on record and it is admitted case of the parties also that Varinder Dev Joshi was owner of the offending vehicle. His legal heirs Sushil Joshi has sold the vehicle to respondent No.2 on 14.3.2015 and thereafter on 28.4.2015 the accident has taken place. Now the contention of respondent No.1 is that respondent No.2 is liable to make the payment being the present owner of the vehicle while respondent No.2 is alleging that respondent No.1 along is liable to make the payment being legal heirs of Varinder Dev Joshi has registration of the vehicle is still in the name of Varinder Dev Joshi and it could not be transferred in the name of respondent No.2. In this regard this Tribunal is of the view that respondent No.2 is liable being present owner of the vehicle and respondent No.1 is liable being registered owner. Till the vehicle is not transferred in the name of purchaser, the registered owner cannot avoid the liability on the ground that he has sold the vehicle. The liability of the purchaser is co- extensive with the registered owner from whom it would pass on Insurance Company if any. Reliance in this regard can be placed on the law laid down by Hon’ble Supreme Court in case titled as Pushpa @ Leela & ors. Vs. Shkuntala & ors. 2011 AIR (SC) 682 . However in the present case the vehicle was not insured, therefore, the registered owner/present owner/purchaser/driver are jointly and severally liable. ISSUE NO. 3: 16 Nek Wati & others vs. Varinder & Ors . 30.The learned counsel for respondents No.2 & 3 argued that the present petition is not maintainable as previously also the claim petition was filed by the claimant but the same was withdrawn and now second petition is not maintainable and the same is not liable to be dismissed. Learned counsel further stated that the affidavits of the claimant witnesses were not properly verified, therefore, those cannot be relied upon. In support of his arguments learned counsel relied upon the law laid down by Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in case titled as Inder Pal Dua & anr. Vs. M/s Yash Garg & Co. 2002(3) Civil Court Cases 437 and Milka Singh and others Vs. Nirmal Singh and others 2008(1) RCR 46 , therefore, the evidence cannot be relied upon and the petition is not maintainable. 31.As regard to previous petition learned counsel for the claimant rebutted the arguments and alleged that previous petition was not decided on merit and it was dismissed as withdrawn and therefore, the claim petition is maintainable. In support of his arguments learned counsel relied upon the law laid down by Hon’ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in case titled as Suresh Devi and others Vs. Jasbir Singh and others 2014 (173) PLR 466. As regard to verification of affidavit of the witnesses the learned counsel argued that the provisions of CPC are not strictly applicable on the proceedings before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal and moreover, the witnesses have been cross-examined at length by the opposite party, therefore, it cannot said that the petition 17 Nek Wati & others vs. Varinder & Ors . is liable to be dismissed on this ground. 32. The arguments advance by learned counsel for both the sides are duly considered apart from perusing the record. As far as maintainability of the present petition is concerned the learned counsel for respondents No.2 and 3 is alleging that previously a petition was filed and the same has been withdrawn, therefore, the present petition is not maintainable. In this regard this Tribunal is of view that it is admitted case of the parties that previous matter was not decided on merit, rather it was dismissed as withdrawn, therefore, the present petition is maintainable. Reliance in this regard can be placed on law laid down by Hon’ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in case titled as Suresh Devi and others Vs. Jasbir Singh and others 2014 (173) PLR 466. As far as proper verification of the affidavits is concerned the provisions of CPC are not strictly applicable on the proceedings before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal and moreover, the witnesses have been cross-examined at length by the opposite party, therefore, it cannot said that the petition is liable to be dismissed on this ground. When a party has opportunity to cross-exaine the witness on the point that which contention of the affidavit is true and correct as per the knowledge of the witness and which contention is correct as per belief of witness then the ground that the verification is not proper is of no use and it cannot be taken. Therefore, this objection is also without any substance. In such circumstances, the case law Inder Pal Dua's case 18 Nek Wati & others vs. Varinder & Ors . (supra) and Milka Singh's case (supra) are not helpful to respondent No.1. 33. In view of above discussion, issue No.3 is decided against the respondents. RELIEF: 34. In view of above discussion, it is held that the claimants are entitled for compensation and an award of Rs. Rs.13,30,000/- (Rs.Thirteen Lacs Thirty Thousand only) is hereby passed in favour of claimants and against the respondents along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the realization of the whole of this amount. However in the present case the vehicle was not insured, therefore, the registered owner/present owner/purchaser/driver are jointly and severally liable. The share of compensation amount of the claimants shall be as under:- Claimant No.1 = 50% Claimant No.2 = 10% Claimant No.3 = 10% Claimant No.4 = 10% Claimant No.5 = 10% Claimant No.6 = 10% 35. The half amount of compensation of claimant No.1 and the entire amount of minor claimants No.3 to 6 shall be deposited in the 19 Nek Wati & others vs. Varinder & Ors . form of FDR in their names in any nationalized bank of their choice. The said amount of claimant No.1 shall be deposited for a period of one year while the minor claimants No.3 to 6 shall be entitled to withdraw their share after attaining the majority. The remaining share of claimant No.1 and entire share of claimant No.2 shall be paid to them on supplying copy of bank account. The petition is accepted accordingly. There is no order as to costs.

Mandeep Singh and others A W A R D:- Claimant by way of the present petition is claiming compensation on account of injuries sustained by him in a motor vehicle accident. 2It is alleged that on 21.11.2014, the claimant was going towards his house in village Kumbra, Mohali as a pillion rider of the scooter no. PB 11M 3796 driven by Harminder Singh @ Harry. At about 02:00 PM, when they reached near Kumbra Chowk, Mohali, respondent No.1 or 1A came driving offending car bearing No. CH 01AL 1492 from the side of Chandigarh at a very high speed in a rash and negligent manner, struck against the scooter, as a result thereof, claimant fell down on the road and suffered multiple injuries including fracture on vital parts of his body. The accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 or respondent No.1A. The claimant is claiming compensation to the tune of Rs.50 lacs on various counts and prayed that compensation be awarded along with interest @ 24% per annum from the date of petition till realization of the amount. 3Upon notice, respondents contested the claim of claimant. Respondent No.1 and 2 filed joint written statement, contested the claim and inter alia pleaded that the story put forth by the claimant is wrong. The vehicle has been insured with Oriental Insurance Company vide cover note. Respondent No.1A adopted the written statement filed by respondent No.1 and 2 vide statement of counsel dated 14.11.2017. Harish Anand, Motor Accident Claim Tribunal, Chandigarh 2 Manjit Sigh v. Mandeep Singh and others Respondent No.3 Insurance Company contested the claim of claimant, inter alia pleaded that driver of the vehicle No. CH 01AL 1492 was not holding the valid Driving Licence at the time of alleged accident. Further, it reserves its right to take up all the defences available under section 147, 134 (c), 149, 157, 158 (6) and 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act. On merits the averments made in the petition were denied being wrong and it was asserted that a false claim petition has been filed. In the end, it was prayed that the petition be dismissed. 4From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed. 1Whether the claimant received injuries in an accident caused by respondent No.1 or 1A while driving vehicle No.CH 01AL 1492 in rash and negligent manner? OPP 2Whether the claimant is entitled to compensation, if so, from whom and to which extent? OPP 3Whether respondent No.1 or 1A was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident? OPR 4.Relief. 5In support of his version, claimant himself stepped into witness as PW1 and stated the manner regarding the accident having taken place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1A.

Respondent No.3 Insurance Company tendered into evidence insurance policy Ex. R1, registered letter Ex. R2, copy of claim form Ex. R3. Counsel for respondent No.1A tendered into evidence copy of Driving Licence of Sandeep Singh Ex. R4 and closed the evidence. 6I have heard counsel for the parties and perused the record with their assistance. My issue wise findings are as under. Issue No.1. 8To prove this issue, there is on record the statement of claimant-injured Manjit Singh @ Baljit Singh. He has tendered in evidence his affidavit Ex.PW1/A reiterating the facts pleaded in petition qua this accident. The respondents No.1 and 2 placed on record copy of judgment Ex. R8 dated 03.11.2015 passed by MACT, Chandigarh and Harish Anand, Motor Accident Claim Tribunal, Chandigarh 4 Manjit Sigh v. Mandeep Singh and others copy of another judgment dated 09.11.2015 passed by MACT, Mohali Ex. R9 arising out of the same accident and in both the judgments it was held that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of Sandeep Singh who has been arrayed as respondent No.1A in the present claim petition. Moreover, respondents No.1A and 2 have also failed to give any plausible explanation regarding the involvement of respondent no.1A as driver and vehicle in question in the accident in question falsely and have further failed to rebut the evidence of claimant to the contrary. Had it been so, it would have been very natural for respondents No.1A and 2 to move any representation to any authority regarding the false implication of respondent no.1A and the vehicle in the accident in question. This also lends credence to the version of the claimant. Another fact which can be taken into consideration is judgment Ex. R11 delivered by the court of learned JMIC, Mohali in FIR No.173 dated 21.11.2014 under Sections 279/337/338/304A/427 IPC, PS-Phase VIII, Mohali in State v. Sandeep Singh son of Malkiat Singh whereby Sandeep Singh who is respondent No.1A was convicted and sentenced vide judgment dated 31.01.2017. 9So, in these circumstances, on the basis of evidence that has come on record from both the sides in this respect, after evaluating the same, the claimant has proved that the accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1A. Respondent No.1 was not driving the offending car at the time of accident. Accordingly, issue no.1 is decided in favour of claimant and against the respondent No.1A. Issue No.2 Harish Anand, Motor Accident Claim Tribunal, Chandigarh 5 Manjit Sigh v. Mandeep Singh and others 10The question to be decided under this issue is that to what extent the claimant is entitled to compensation. In the present case the claimant was 19 years of age at the time of accident. It has been claimed that due to the accident the claimant suffered fracture distal shaft of humerus and distal. He has further claimed that he had spent an amount of Rs. 1,50,000/- on his treatment. He remained hospitalized w.e.f. 22.11.2014 to 27.11.2014. 11Admittedly the claimant suffered a fracture distal shaft of humerus and distal for which he was operated upon the steel plates were inserted. Ex.P2 is the discharge and follow up card of claimant showing injury on the person of claimant in a road accident on 22.11.2014 and it also reveals that the claimant remained hspitalized from 22.11.2014 to 27.11.2014 i.e. for 6 days. So ar as the other compensation, this Tribunal can very well take notice that the claimant remained hospitalized for for 6 days. Thus, he definitely incurred extra expenditure on special diet as well as an attendant. As such, the claimant is held entitled to a sum of Rs.1,000/- on account of special diedt and attendant charges of 6 days and thus the amount comes to Rs.6,000/- towards special diet. The claimant must have been bed ridden for almost about 30 days post surgery, it can be well taken note that claimant would have required the services of an attendant, which is assessed to Rs.15,000/- and is appropirate to be granted to the claimant towards expensexs of attendant. This Tribunal can also well take notice of pain and sufferings undergone by the claimant at the young age of 19 years and he is further held entitled to Rs.20,000/- on Harish Anand, Motor Accident Claim Tribunal, Chandigarh 6 Manjit Sigh v. Mandeep Singh and others account pain and sufferings. The claimant have proved on record the amount spent on purchase of medicines and proved the bills in this regard as Ex. P7 to Ex. P20 which are amounting to Rs. 45,723/- to which the claimant is held entitled to. 12The disability suffered by the claimant is only 3% qua left upper limb. It has nowhere come in evidence that with this disability he is feeling any difficult in doing his routine work. Still keeping in mind the young age of the claimant and the extent of disability suffered by him, he is granted Rs.50,000/- compensation on this count. The claimant is thus found to be entitled to Rs. 1,36,723/-. 13The accident has been duly proved and the involvement of the respondent No.1A being driver of offending motorcycle also stands duly proved. The vehicle is owned by respondent No.2. Accordingly, it is is held that claimant is entitled to compensation of above sum and the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the same to the claimant. Accordingly, issue No.2 stand decided in favor of claimant and against the respondents. Issue No.3. 14Onus to prove this issue was upon respondent no.3. However, it did not lead any evidence in this regard. Moreover, perusal of the driving licence of respondent No.1A which is Ex.R1 on court file, reveals respondent No.1 was holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident and the genuineness of the same is not disputed. As Harish Anand, Motor Accident Claim Tribunal, Chandigarh 7 Manjit Sigh v. Mandeep Singh and others such, this issued is decided in favour of respondent No.1A and against respondent No.3. Respondent No.1 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimant. Relief. 15Keeping in view my findings on the above issues, this claim petition is allowed to the extent that an award of Rs.1,36,723/- is passed in favour of the claimant and against the respondent No.1A, 2 and 3. Respondent No.1 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimant. This amount of compensation will be paid by the respondents jointly and severally along with interest at the rate of 6 % per annum from the date of filing of petition till date of realization. Memo of costs be prepared and file be consigned to record room. (Harish Anand) Pronounced. Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, 19.01.2018. Chandigarh.

Sandeep Singh son of Malkiat Singh whereby Sandeep Singh who is respondent No.1A was convicted and sentenced vide judgment dated 31.01.2017. 9So, in these circumstances, on the basis of evidence that has come on record from both the sides in this respect, after evaluating the same, the claimant has proved that the accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1A. Respondent No.1 was not driving the offending car at the time of accident. Accordingly, issue no.1 is decided in favour of claimant and against the respondent No.1A. Issue No.2 Harish Anand, Motor Accident Claim Tribunal, Chandigarh 5 Manjit Sigh v. Mandeep Singh and others 10The question to be decided under this issue is that to what extent the claimant is entitled to compensation. In the present case the claimant was 19 years of age at the time of accident. It has been claimed that due to the accident the claimant suffered fracture distal shaft of humerus and distal. He has further claimed that he had spent an amount of Rs. 1,50,000/- on his treatment. He remained hospitalized w.e.f. 22.11.2014 to 27.11.2014. 11Admittedly the claimant suffered a fracture distal shaft of humerus and distal for which he was operated upon the steel plates were inserted. Ex.P2 is the discharge and follow up card of claimant showing injury on the person of claimant in a road accident on 22.11.2014 and it also reveals that the claimant remained hspitalized from 22.11.2014 to 27.11.2014 i.e. for 6 days. So ar as the other compensation, this Tribunal can very well take notice that the claimant remained hospitalized for for 6 days. Thus, he definitely incurred extra expenditure on special diet as well as an attendant. As such, the claimant is held entitled to a sum of Rs.1,000/- on account of special diedt and attendant charges of 6 days and thus the amount comes to Rs.6,000/- towards special diet. The claimant must have been bed ridden for almost about 30 days post surgery, it can be well taken note that claimant would have required the services of an attendant, which is assessed to Rs.15,000/- and is appropirate to be granted to the claimant towards expensexs of attendant. This Tribunal can also well take notice of pain and sufferings undergone by the claimant at the young age of 19 years and he is further held entitled to Rs.20,000/- on Harish Anand, Motor Accident Claim Tribunal, Chandigarh 6 Manjit Sigh v. Mandeep Singh and others account pain and sufferings. The claimant have proved on record the amount spent on purchase of medicines and proved the bills in this regard as Ex. P7 to Ex. P20 which are amounting to Rs. 45,723/- to which the claimant is held entitled to. 12The disability suffered by the claimant is only 3% qua left upper limb. It has nowhere come in evidence that with this disability he is feeling any difficult in doing his routine work. Still keeping in mind the young age of the claimant and the extent of disability suffered by him, he is granted Rs.50,000/- compensation on this count. The claimant is thus found to be entitled to Rs. 1,36,723/-. 13The accident has been duly proved and the involvement of the respondent No.1A being driver of offending motorcycle also stands duly proved. The vehicle is owned by respondent No.2. Accordingly, it is is held that claimant is entitled to compensation of above sum and the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the same to the claimant. Accordingly, issue No.2 stand decided in favor of claimant and against the respondents. Issue No.3. 14Onus to prove this issue was upon respondent no.3. However, it did not lead any evidence in this regard. Moreover, perusal of the driving licence of respondent No.1A which is Ex.R1 on court file, reveals respondent No.1 was holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident and the genuineness of the same is not disputed. As Harish Anand, Motor Accident Claim Tribunal, Chandigarh 7 Manjit Sigh v. Mandeep Singh and others such, this issued is decided in favour of respondent No.1A and against respondent No.3. Respondent No.1 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimant. Relief. 15Keeping in view my findings on the above issues, this claim petition is allowed to the extent that an award of Rs.1,36,723/- is passed in favour of the claimant and against the respondent No.1A, 2 and 3. Respondent No.1 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimant. This amount of compensation will be paid by the respondents jointly and severally along with interest at the rate of 6 % per annum from the date of filing of petition till date of realization. Memo of costs be prepared and file be consigned to record room. (Harish Anand) Pronounced. Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, 19.01.2018. Chandigarh.

Sh. PIP Singh, counsel for respondents No.1 & 2. Sh. Simrandeep Singh, counsel for respondent No.3. Sh. Satish Kumar, counsel for respondents No.4 & 5. A W A R D The present claim petition has been filed by the claimant under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act (hereinafter referred to as the “Act”) seeking compensation to the Kanika Jain vs. Mustfa Khan etc. 2 tune of Rs.2,00,00,000/- along with interest at the rate of 18% per annum with costs of the petition on account of the death of Gaurav Jain son of Sh.Nirmal Kumar Jain in the motor vehicular accident. 2.The facts which led to the filing of the present claim petition are that on 06.12.2014, deceased was going to his office on his motor cycle bearing registration No.CH- 01-N-2683, from his residence. His colleague was also with him on his separate bike. When deceased reached near Intzar Farm House, Suraj Kund road, Faridabad (Haryana), one dumper/truck bearing registration No. HR-38-N-9655, being driven by respondent No.1 in rash and negligent manner and at very high speed has hit the motor cycle of deceased and due to that he fell under the front wheel of truck and crushed thereunder. As a result of this accident, he suffered serious injuries on his vital organs. Public gathered at the spot and stopped the truck, but somehow, respondent No.1 fled away from the spot. Thereafter colleague of claimant namely Rohit Kapur, took the deceased in a private vehicle to Asian Hospital, Sector 21-A, Faridabad, where he succumbed to injuries. The matter was reported to the police and a case vide FIR No. 447 dated 06.12.2014 was registered against the respondent No.1 for the offence punishable under Section 279, 304-A of Indian Penal Code in Police Station, Suraj Kund, Faridabad. 3.It is further pleaded that on the date of accident, the age of deceased was 28 years and he was posted as A.G.M., White Fields Overseas Private Limited, Pinakal Tower, Suraj Kund, Faridabad (Haryana) and was earning Rs.60,000/- per month. A sum of Rs.1,00,000/- was spent on his funeral and last rites. The claimant is wife, respondent No.4 is mother and respondent No.5 is father of the deceased Gaurav Jain. The claimant had suffered a huge loss due to untimely death of the deceased. The claimant is thus, entitled to a Kanika Jain vs. Mustfa Khan etc. 3 compensation of Rs.2.00 crores along with interest @ 18% P.A. on account of death of Gaurav Jain in the motor vehicular accident. 4.The petition is contested by the respondents. The respondent No.1 & 2, owner and driver of offending vehicle bearing registration No. HR-38-N-9655 have denied all the averments of the claimants and prayed for dismissal of the claim petition. 5.The respondent No.3 SBI General Insurance Company Limited also denied the accident in question. It is pleaded that the answering respondent has not received any information regarding the alleged accident by the respondent No.1. It is further pleaded that the respondent No.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence on the date of accident. Further, there was no valid and effective route permit of the offending vehicle at the time of accident and the same was being plied against the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, therefore, the Insurance Company is not liable for any compensation to be paid to the claimant. The amount claimed by the claimant is also excessive and exorbitant without any basis. Dismissal of the petition is prayed for. 6.Respondents No.4 & 5 in their joint written statement have pleaded that the claimant was not dependent upon deceased Gaurav Jain, because there was disputed between claimant and deceased Gaurav Jain and they were residing separately and divorce proceedings were initiated by them. Respondents No.4 & 5 being mother and father of deceased were dependent upon him. The claimant is not entitled for any compensation on account of death of Gaurav Jain. With these submissions, prayer was made to dismiss the claim petition. 7.The claimant opted not to file replication to the written statements and from the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed vide order dated 22.07.2015: Kanika Jain vs. Mustfa Khan etc. 4 1.Whether accident dated 06.12.2014 causing the death of Gaurav Jain has occurred due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle bearing No. HR-38-N- 9655 being driven by respondent No.1?OPP 2.If issue No.1 is decided in affirmative, whether the claimant is entitled for compensation, if so, how much and from whom ?OPP 3.Whether the respondent No.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident ?OPR 4.Whether there was valid and effective route permit of the offending vehicle at the time of accident ?OPR 5.Relief 8.Both the parties were called upon to lead their evidence, whereupon, in order to prove her case, the claimant has examined herself as PW-1 and also examined Ramesh Kumar, Tax Assistant, office of Income Tax Department, Ward No.5 (3), Sector 17, Chandigarh as PW-2, ASI Karambir Singh, Police Station Suraj Kund, Faridabad as PW-3 and Rohit Kapoor, eye witness, as PW-4 and thereafter, learned counsel for claimant closed the evidence by suffering separate statement. On the other side, the respondent No.5 appeared as RW-1. Thereafter, evidence on behalf of respondents No.4 & 5 was closed by their counsel by suffering separate statement. Whereas, no oral evidence was led on behalf of the respondents No.1 to 3. The parties to the claim petition have also relied upon certain documents which would also be referred at proper place. 9.I have apprised the entire evidence on record and have gone through the case file very carefully. I have also heard Sh. P.C. Rana, counsel for the claimant, Sh. PIP Singh, counsel for the respondents No.1 & 2 and Sh. Simrandeep Singh, Counsel for respondent No. 3, Sh. Satish Kumar, counsel for respondents No.4 & 5. My issue-wise findings with reasons thereof are as under:- ISSUE NO.1 Kanika Jain vs. Mustfa Khan etc. 5 10.In order to prove issue No.1, the claimant has produced Ex. P-8 FIR No.447 dated 06.12.2014 pertaining to Police Station Suraj Kund, under Section 279, 304-A of Indian Penal Code. The aforesaid FIR was lodged on the statement of complainant Rohit Kapoor (PW-4). As per version given by PW-4 Rohit Kapoor to the police that he was employed in the company named White Fields Overseas Private Limited, Pinakal Tower, Suraj Kund, Faridabad (Haryana). Gaurav Jain son of Nirmal Kumar Jain, resident of House No.2, Sector 51-A, Chandigarh was also sesrving in the said company. On 06.12.2014, at about 9.30 AM, he on his separate bike and Gaurav Jain on his separate bike were going to their office. At that time, Gaurav Jain was just ahead of him. When they reached on the road Intezar Farm House, Surajkund, a Dumper came from behind at very high speed, in rash and negligent manner and struck against the motor cycle of Gaurav Jain. As a result of this, Gaurav Jain fell down along with motor cycle and front tyre of said dumper ran over his leg and thigh. People gathered at the spot and they stopped the said dumper. He noted down the registration number of said dumper as HR-38-N-9655. Thereafter, he with the help of traffic police and other people took Gaurav Jain to the Asian Hospital, in private vehicle, where he died. He also alleged that though at the place of accident, driver of said dumper was apprehended by people, but later on he managed to fled away from the spot. He categorically stated that the accident in question had taken place due to the fault of driver of dumper. He prayer for action against the driver of said dumper. In order to establish the authenticity of the version given by Rohit Kapoor – complainant, the claimant examined said Rohit Kapoor as PW-4. In his testimony, he testified on the lines of his allegations in the FIR. During cross examination of this witness, not even a single suggestion was given that accident in question was not caused by the respondent No.1. Further, in this regard, Kanika Jain vs. Mustfa Khan etc. 6 claimant has also examined PW-3 ASI Karambir Singh, who brought the summoned record of the FIR and proved the copy of FIR Ex.P-8. 11.In order to rebut the above said version of the claimant, learned counsel for the respondent No.3 has vociferously argued that the claimant has failed to prove the negligence on the part of the respondent No.1. It was further submitted that from the perusal of the mechanical report, it is not established that the accident has taken place, so, from the above, it is clear that a false claim has been laid by the claimant on the basis of procured documents. He has also drawn the attention of the court on the mechanical report Ex.PW-3/R-1. However, this contention of learned counsel for the respondent is without any merits. First of all, to rebut the claim of the claimant, the respondent No.1 has not stepped into the witness box. Thus, in the given circumstance an adverse inference is liable to be drawn against him. Reliance on this point can be placed on the authority of Hon'ble High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh in case titled Raju and others Vs. Sukhwinder Singh and others 2006(4) RCR (Civil) 82 . Secondly, PW-3 ASI Karambit Singh, who is Investigating Officer of the criminal case qua the accident in question, during the course of cross examination at the hands of learned counsel for the respondent No.3, has categorically deposed that he has presented the challan in the case FIR in question. He himself has impounded the vehicle No. HR-38-N-9655 on the spot of occurrence. The above said facts, itself proves that the respondent No.1 has been challaned for driving the vehicle in rash and negligent manner and thereby causing the death of Gaurav Jain. Whereas, nothing contrary has been proved on record by the respondents No.1 to 3. In these circumstances, the claimant has been able to prove successfully that the accident was caused by respondent No.1 Mustfa Khan while driving the dumper bearing registration No. HR-38-N-9655 in rash and negligent manner on Kanika Jain vs. Mustfa Khan etc. 7 public road. Thus, findings on issue No.1 stands returned in favour of the claimants. ISSUE NO.2 12.The claimant has mentioned the age of the deceased as 28 years in the claim petition. The age of the deceased has also been mentioned as 28 years in the Post Mortem Report Ex. P 1. Further as per the copy of Computation of Total Income and Tax Thereof, issued by Income Tax Department, Ex.P-6, the date of birth of the deceased was 21.08.1986. No contrary evidence has been brought on file by the respondent. Thus, the age of the deceased Gaurav Jain is assessed as 28 years on the date of accident. 13.Further, it is necessary to ascertain the income of the deceased Gaurav Jain on the basis of the oral as well as documentary evidence available on record. In claim petition, it is claimed that deceased Gaurav Jain was employed as AGM with White Fields Overseas Pvt. Ltd., Pinakal Tower, Suraj Kund, Faridabad (Haryana). In order to prove the same, the claimant has examined PW-4 Rohit Kapoor, who is eye witness of the accident as well as colleague of the deceased Gaurav Jain. He has brought the employment record of the deceased Gaurav Jain and proved his salary slip for the month of October, 2014 and November, 2014 as Ex.P-16 and Ex.P-17. As per salary slip Ex.P-17, the last pay drawn by the deceased was Rs.42,000/-. On the other hand, the respondents No.1 to 3 have failed to prove contrary to the documentary evidence led by the claimant. There is no adverse evidence, led by the respondents No.1 to 3, that the deceased was not capable to earn that much amount. Thus, the earning of the deceased is assessed at Rs.42,000/- per month. 14.In the year 2014, the annual income exceeding Rs.2,00,000/- was taxable and a person can show the savings up to Rs.1,00,000/- to save himself/herself from further deductions. As per salary certificate Ex.PW-3/A, a deduction of Rs.10,920/- per annum is Kanika Jain vs. Mustfa Khan etc. 8 shown from the salary of deceased Gaurav Jain. Thus, deducting 10% as income tax from the annual income exceeding Rs.2,10,920/- of deceased Gaurav Jain, her annual income comes to Rs.4,74,692/- (Rs.5,04,000/- - Rs.29,308/- (10% of excess income). 14.The learned counsel for the claimants has submitted that there has been incremental enhancement in the income of those who are engaged on daily basis, monthly basis or even seasonal basis and judicial notice of this fact is to be taken with a view to meet the challenges posed by high cost of living, the persons falling in the latter category periodically increase the cost of their labour. He further contended that if the cost of living increases and the prices of essential go up, but it is natural for him to increase the cost of his labour and so will be the cases of ordinary skilled and unskilled labour. With these submissions, the learned counsel for the claimants prayed that under the circumstances explained above an addition of 50 percent increase in his total income is liable to be taken towards future prospects in view of law laid down in various pronouncements of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, which comes to Rs.19,780/-. To buttress his submissions, he has relied upon the judgment rendered by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Civil Appeal No. 3860 of 2013 arisen out of S.L.P. (Civil) No.22325 of 2010 titled as Rajesh & others versus Rajbir Singh & others, decided on 12.04.2013 , wherein, it has held that “having regard to the fact that in the case of those self-employed or on fixed wages, where there is normally no age of superannuation, we are of the view that it will only be just and equitable to provide an addition of 50% in the case where the victim is blow the age of 40 years.” The facts of the above judgment are fully applicable to the present case. Therefore, an increase of 50% to the income of deceased, which comes to Rs.19,780/- is liable to be taken. Accordingly, the total income of the deceased is assessed at Rs.59,340/- per month or Rs.7,12,080/- per annum. Kanika Jain vs. Mustfa Khan etc. 9 15.So far as the dependency of the claimants upon the deceased is concerned, claimant Kanika Jain is wife, respondent No.4 Kanta Rani Jain is mother and respondent No.5 Nirmal Kumar Jain is father of the deceased Gaurav Jain. Though, in the present case, it is the stand of the respondents No.4 & 5 that at the time of accident, the claimant was not residing with the deceased Gaurav Jain, as matrimonial litigation was going on between them and their son has already filed the divorce petition against claimant Kanika Jain, therefore, she was not dependent upon him. However, this plea of the respondents No.4 & 5 is devoid of merits. Because, it is not a disputed fact that at the time of death of deceased Gaurav Jain, she was his legally wedded wife, in the absence of any decree of divorce between them. 16.So, in view of above, in the present case the number of dependents upon deceased Gaurav Jain are three. Therefore, keeping in view the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in case titled Smt. Sarla Verma Versus Delhi Transport Corporation (SC) 2009(3) RCR (CIVIL) 77 the deduction should be 1/3rd and the dependency of the claimants comes to Rs.4,74,720/- per annum. 17.As already held, the age of the deceased at the time of accident was 28 years. Thus, keeping in view the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India , in Sarla Verma's case (supra) the multiplier of 18 is to be applied in this case. Accordingly, the claimants are entitled to compensation of Rs.85,44,960/- (Rs.4,74,960/- X 18 = 85,44,960/- ). 18.As far as consortium as a major head to calculate is concerned, this court is in agreement with the learned counsel for the claimant who has stressfully argued in this regard with the help of order of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Civil Appeal No.3860 of 2013 arising out of S.L.P. (Civil) No.22325 of 2010 titled Rajesh & others versus Rajbir Singh & others . It was held in Rajesh Kumar's case (supra) as under : Kanika Jain vs. Mustfa Khan etc. 10 “By loss of consortium, the courts have made an attempt to compensate the loss of spouse's affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations during the future years. Unlike the compensation awarded in other countries and other jurisdictions, since the legal heirs are otherwise adequately compensated for the pecuniary loss, it would not be proper to award a major amount under this head. Hence, we are of the view that it would only be just and reasonable that the courts award at least rupees one lakh for loss of consortium.” 19.Therefore, in view of principle as laid down in Rajesh Kumar's case (supra) , a compensation of Rs.1.00 lac on account of consortium is awarded to the claimant No.3. 20.The Hon'ble apex Court in Civil Appeal No. 3860 of 2013 (Arising out of S.L.P. (Civil) No.22325 of 2010) titled as Rajesh & Others versus Rajbir Singh , has held that : “There are many other expenses in connection with funeral and, if the deceased is follower of any particular religion, there are several religious practices and conventions pursuant to death in a family. All those are quite expensive. Therefore, we are of the view that it will be just, fair and equitable, under the head of 'Funeral Expenses, in the absence of evidence to the contrary for higher expenses, to award atleast an amount of Rs.25,000/-.” Thus in view of law laid down by the Hon'ble apex Court, the claimants are also awarded a sum of Rs.25,000/- on account of transportation, funeral and last rites of the deceased Kanika Jain vs. Mustfa Khan etc. 11 Gaurav Jain. 21.The claimant being wife, respondent No.4 being mother and respondent No.5 being father have been deprived of the love and affection of deceased Gaurav Jain, due to his untimely death. Therefore, the claimant and respondents No.4 & 5 are awarded a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- each for the loss of love and affection of deceased Gaurav Jain as per the principles laid down by the Hon'ble apex Court in case of Vimal Kanwar and others versus Kishore Dan and others 2013 (3) Recent Apex Judgments 446 . 22.In this way, claimants are awarded a compensation mentioned below :- Sr.No Head under which amount awardedAmount. 1. Loss of dependency :Rs.85,44,960.00 2. Compensation on account of consortium.:Rs.1,00,000.00 3. Loss of Love & Affection :Rs.300000/- (Rs.100000/- each for claimant and respondents No.4 & 5. 4. Expenses incurred on Transportation, funeral and last rites. :Rs. 25,000.00 TOTAL :Rs.89,69,960.00 23. Thus, claimants are held entitled to a total compensation of Rs.89,69,960/- (Rs. Eighty Nine Lacs Sixty Nine Thousand Nine Hundred Sixty only). 24. So far as the liability of the respondents is concerned, as observed under issue No. 1 the accident in question was caused with the truck of respondent No.1 bearing registration No. HR-38-N-9655 in the manner narrated above. The respondent No.1 has placed on record the copy of his driving licence as Ex.RW-1/1. Perusal of Ex.RW-1/1 reveals Kanika Jain vs. Mustfa Khan etc. 12 that initially it was issued on 18.10.1988 for MLV and GV . Later on, on 13.05.1991 endorsement for driving of Transport vehicle was made in the said licence. This licence was renewed from from time to time and it was valid up to 06.12.2016 for Transport Vehicle. The accident in this case has occurred on 06.12.2014. The onus to prove this issue was upon respondent No.3, but no contrary evidence has been led by the respondent No.3 SBI General Insurance Company Limited. Further, the respondent No.3 has placed on record the copy of Insurance Ex.R-19 of the vehicle in question, which was valid from 27.03.2014 to 26.03.2015. Therefore, it is proved that respondent No.1 Mustfa Khan was having a valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident and there was no violation of the said Insurance Policy Ex.R-19. Accordingly, issue No.3, is decided against respondent No.3. ISSUE NO.4 25.Onus to prove this issue was upon the respondent No.3. The respondent has taken a categoric stand that at the time of accident, there was no valid and effective route permit of the offending vehicle. However, the respondent No.2 owner of the truck has proved on record the photo copies of National Route Permit as Ex.RW-1/3 and Ex.RW-1/4, which was initially issued on 23.11.2007 and renewed from time tome and it was valid upto 22.10.2017. So, from the above, it is clear that there was valid and effective route permit of the truck in question at the time of accident. This issue also stands decided against the respondent No.3. RELIEF: 26.As an offshot of above said findings on all issues, the present claim petition succeed and is accepted partly with costs. Claimants are awarded a total compensation of Rs.89,69,960/- (Rs. Eighty Nine Lacs Sixty Nine Thousand Nine Hundred Sixty only) on Kanika Jain vs. Mustfa Khan etc. 13 account of death of Gaurav Jain in the accident in question.

He was being followed by his uncle Sh. Kishan Pal who was on a rickshaw rehri. When the deceased was crossing the Kali Bari light points, Chandigarh, at that time, a truck bearing registration no.PB-11-AS-8345 came at fast speed from their behind and struck against the cycle of the deceased. The aforesaid truck did not blow any horn. As a result of the accident, the deceased fell on the road and his head was crushed by the wheel of the aforesaid truck. He was taken to PGI, Chandigarh immediately where he died on 20.2.2015 due to the injuries he sustained in this accident. The aforesaid truck was being driven at fast speed and in rash and negligent manner by Baldev Singh respondent no.1. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing registration no.PB-11-AS- 8345 driven by Baldev Singh respondent no.1. The deceased was not at all at fault. A criminal case was registered against Baldev Singh for causing the accident on the basis of the statement of Kishan Pal. 3 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . 3The claimant was 15 years old student at the time of accident. The future monthly income of the deceased may be taken as Rs.25,000/-. FIR no.57 dated 19.2.2015 u/s 279, 337 IPC was registered in Police Station Sector 31, Chandigarh. The deceased sustained serious injuries which were sufficient to cause death. He was attended by the doctors on duty in PGI, Chandigarh. A sum of Rs.50,000/- was spent on funeral expenses and performing last rites of the deceased. Rs.75 lacs have been claimed for untimely death of the deceased, loss of love & affection to the claimants, future prospects, loss to the estate, funeral expenses etc. 4In response to the notice, the respondents appeared. Respondents no.1 & 2 filed written statement taking preliminary objections that the claim is totally false, frivolous and fabricated. The accident is not caused due to any fault on the part of respondent no.1. 5While replying on merits, it is admitted that the deceased was coming on the road leading from 3 BRD Air Force Station, Chandigarh on left side of the road and his uncle had also accompanied him. It is admitted that his uncle was on rickshaw rehri, but his uncle was not following the rickshaw rehri and unfortunately it was deceased who was following his uncle who was ahead of him at Kalibari light point. The vehicle of the answering respondent as well as the deceased on cycle were 4 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . on Kali Bari light point waiting for their green light. Rehri of uncle of deceased was ahead of the truck. The deceased was at his left hand side and had to go ahead straightaway. The respondent no.1 had to take turn for left hand side and given indicator for his turn on his left hand side. When green light signal of both the truck and cyclist was on, his uncle on rehri ahead of the truck had moved ahead in straightaway direction, the unfortunate immature cyclist in haste in order to catch his uncle, had not noted the indicator of truck being given to have bend on left hand side, struck against left hand back side conductor side tyre. The unfortunate cyclist was supposed to wait for the long vehicle (truck) to cross at left hand side, but he had not waited and was in hurry to catch his uncle going ahead of him in straightaway position. The respondent no.1 stopped his vehicle and some person from public standing there had tried to beat the respondent and in response to the same, the policemen and other passerby standing there at that time had objected to it by saying that the respondent no.1 is not at fault and the accident is caused due to the rash and negligent driving of the cyclist as he was in hurry to catch his uncle going ahead of him on rehri and he had not seen the truck moving around left hand side with indicator. Later on the local police in sympathy of deceased had wrongly lodged FIR against respondent no.1 and the respondent no.1 had complained against lodging of this false FIR to the SSP, UT Chandigarh. It is impossible that the driver of heavy vehicle (truck) can see at left hand back side, conductor side tyre, when he is seated at right hand side at front driving side. Therefore, the present case being false, frivolous and 5 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . fabricated be dismissed with costs, in the interest of justice. 6Respondent no.3, Tata AIG General Insurance Company filed written statement taking preliminary objections that the present claim petition has been filed by the claimants in collusion with other respondents. Respondent no.1, driver of truck bearing registration no.PB- 11-AS-8345 did not possess a valid and effective driving license to drive the vehicle at the time of alleged accident and as such, the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. The truck was not having permit, fitness certificate and proper registration certificate to ply on the road and as such, was being driven in contravention of the terms and conditions of the policy. Respondents no.1 and 2 have committed gross breach of terms and conditions of policy. 7While replying on merits, it is submitted that no information with regard to the alleged accident has been received by the answering respondent from any quarter. The owner of the truck had given no written information to the answering respondent regarding the accident in question, though the insurance policy, if any, specifically enjoins upon the insured that in the event of any happening, whereby the liability might come upon insurance company, a notice in writing must be given to the insurance company. In this case no such information was given, as such the involvement of the truck bearing registration no.PB-11-AS-8345 is denied in the accident in question. The claimants are not entitled to any 6 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . compensation. Further, the claimants were not dependent upon the income of the deceased as deceased was not earning member. The present claim petition has been filed with malafide intention just to grab money from the insurance company. It is further submitted that the answering respondent cannot legally be held liable to pay any compensation in respect of the alleged accident as the same might have taken place due to negligence of the deceased himself. It is specifically denied that the deceased had died in the accident with truck bearing registration no. PB- 11-AS-8345 and that the said vehicle was being driven rashly and negligently by respondent no.1 at the time of accident. However, at any stage, if the answering respondent is held liable for compensation, the interest may not be awarded more than prevailing bank rate i.e. 5.75% per annum. Therefore, the claim petition may be dismissed with costs, in the interest of justice and fair play. 8 From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed vide order dated 23.9.2015:- 1 Whether Master Chhotu @ Rajbhan has died due to rash and negligent driving of respondent o.1 while driving vehicle bearing registration no.PB-11-AS-8345? OPP. 2 Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, as prayed for? OPR. 3 Whether respondent no.1 was not having a valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident? OPR-3. 4 Relief. 9To substantiate their respective claims the parties led their 7 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . evidence. 10The claimants have examined as many as two witnesses in all. Krishan Pal, eye witness of the accident was examined as PW-1. The mother of the deceased namely Smt. Sarvesh herself stepped into the witness box as PW-2. Documents Ex P-1 to Ex P-6 were tendered in evidence. Thereafter, the evidence of the claimants was closed. 11On the other hand, the respondents have not led any oral evidence. However, documents Ex R-1 to Ex R-6 were tendered in evidence and thereafter, the evidence of the respondents was closed. 12No rebuttal evidence was adduced by the claimant. 13The learned counsels for both the parties were heard. The issue wise findings with reasons thereof are as follows : ISSUE No. 1: 14To substantiate this issue, the ld. counsel for the claimants argued that to prove the accident, Krishan Pal, eye witness of the accident appeared as PW-1. He has well deposed that on 19.2.2015, he was going on the road leading from 3 BRD Air Force Station, Chandigarh to village Burail, Sector 45, Chandigarh on a rickshaw rehri and his nephew Master Chhotu @ Rajbhan who was going ahead of him paddling a cycle was hit 8 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . by a truck bearing registration no.PB-11-AS-8345 due to which he sustained serious injuries and later on died in PGI. The FIR was lodged against the driver and it was found that respondent no.1 was driving the said truck. Therefore, from the statement of claimant corroborated with registration of FIR Ex P-1 and post mortem report Ex P-2 , the rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1, the accident and the death of Chhotu in the accident are well proved. 15The learned counsels for the respondents no.1 & 2, on the other hand, opposed the arguments of learned counsel for the claimant. The ld. Counsel argued that it is wrong to say that the accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. Otherwise also, the vehicle in question was insured one, therefore, respondents no.1 & 2 are not liable to any compensation in any manner. 16The learned counsel for the respondent no.3 argued on the same lines. He further argued that the accident and rash & negligent driving is not proved from the statement of PW-1 as he is interested witness. There is no other evidence on the record to prove the accident and rash & negligent driving. The FIR is not sufficient to prove the accident and rash & negligent driving. Therefore, the alleged accident and rash & negligent driving of respondent no.1 are not proved. 17The arguments advanced by learned counsel for both the 9 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . sides are duly considered apart from perusing the record. Krishan Pal while appearing as PW-1 has deposed that on 19.2.2015 at about 4.30 p.m., he was coming on the road leading from 3BRD Air Force Station Chandigarh to village Burail, Sector 45, Chandigarh on a rickshaw rehri. His nephew Master Chhotu @ Rajbhan was going ahead of him while paddling a cycle at slow speed and on left side of the road. When Master Chhotu @ Rajbhan was crossing the Kali Bari light points, Chandigarh, at that time, a truck bearing registration no.PB-11-AS-8345 came at fast speed from their behind and after overtaking the rickshaw rehri, it struck against the cycle of Master Chhotu @ Rajbhan. The said truck did not blow any horn. As a result of the accident, Master Chhotu @ Rajbhan fell on the road and his head was crushed by the wheel of the said truck. He was taken to PGI, Chandigarh immediately where he died on 20.2.2015 due to the injuries he sustained in this accident. The truck was being driven at fast speed in rash and negligent manner by Baldev Singh. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing registration no.PB-11-AS-8345 driven by Baldev Singh. Master Chhotu @ Rajbhan was not at all at fault. A criminal case was registered against Baldev Singh for causing the accident on the basis of his statement. From the statement of PW-1 corroborated with the fact of recording of FIR and the facing of trial by the respondent no.1 and the post mortem report Ex P-2, the accident, the rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and the injuries sustained by the claimant in the accident are well established. The statement of PW-1 cannot be discarded merely on the ground that he 10 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . is interested witness. The witness has given a natural version and his confidence could not be shaken during his cross-examination. If the statement of the witness is found trustworthy, then it can be relied upon and cannot be discarded merely on the ground that witness was an interested witness. Apart from that the accident and rash and negligent driving is to be proved beyond reasonable doubt in criminal trial only. In the civil matters, like claim petitions, the accident and rash and negligent can be proved with the help of preponderance of probabilities also. Reliance in this regard can be given of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in case titled as Kusum Lata and others Vs. Satbir and others, 2011(4) LJR 512. In such circumstances, the rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and the injuries sustained by claimant in accident are well proved. 18 In view of above discussion, issue No. 1 is decided in favour of claimant. ISSUE NO. 2 : 19To substantiate this issue, the learned counsel for the claimant argued that the deceased was 15 years old, student of 8th class. He also used to help his father in agricultural activities as the claimant no.2 is an agriculturist and having about 20-25 bighas of land. To prove this fact, the claimant Sarvesh, mother of the deceased herself has stepped into the witness box who stated that her son was studying in 8th class and 11 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . was also helping his father in agricultural activities. His future monthly income may be assessed as Rs.25,000/-. In alternate, the ld. Counsel further argued that in the case titled as Kishan Gopal & anr. vs. Lala & Ors. 2013 ACJ (SC) 2594, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has taken the income of the deceased child of same age group as Rs.30,000/- per year and used the multiplier of 15 without deducting any amount. Therefore, in alternate the amount of compensation may be assessed in view of the above law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court. 20The learned counsel for respondents, on the other hand, opposed the arguments. It is argued that claimants have failed to prove the income of the deceased by way of evidence. No cogent document regarding the income has been produced , therefore, the claimants are not entitled for any claim. 21The ld. Counsel for respondent no.3 argued on the same lines. Apart from that, the ld. counsel argued that the accident has taken place in the territory of Chandigarh while the respondent no.2 was having no permit for driving the vehicle in the territory of Chandigarh. The permit has been placed by the respondent no.2 on the record as Ex R-3. A perusal of the permit reveals that it is valid for the territory of Punjab only. Therefore, if any claim is assessed by this Tribunal, then respondent no.3 is not liable to pay the compensation. 12 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . 22 The ld. counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 rebutted the arguments of ld. counsel for respondent no.3. It is argued that at the time of accident, there was no passenger in the three-wheeler and it was not being plied for commercial purpose, therefore, there was no requirement of permit at that time. In support of his arguments, ld. counsel relied upon the law laid down by the Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in case titled as Future General Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Smt. Surjo Devi and ors. FAO no.4474 of 2012 decided on 11th September 2012. 23The arguments advanced by ld counsel for both the side are duly considered part from perusing the record. As far as age of the deceased is concerned, the age is alleged to be 15 years by the claimants in the evidence. As per copy of post mortem report Ex P2, the age of the deceased was 15 years. As per copy of school leaving certificate Ex P-5, the date of birth of deceased is 1.7.2001 . As such, the age of the deceased is taken 15 years at the time of accident. 24 As far as the income of the deceased is concerned, as per copy of school leaving certificate Ex P-5, it is proved that the deceased was a student of 8th class. As per statement of PW-2 Smt. Sarvesh, mother of the deceased, the deceased was also helping his father in agricultural activities and he was hale & hearty. However, there is no cogent 13 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . documentary evidence in this regard. Therefore, the income of the deceased cannot be considered to be Rs.25,000/- per month. The schedule of the Act provides that in case of non-earning member, the income should be taken Rs.15,000/- per annum. However, Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed that sufficient time has passed when the income of Rs.15,000/- p.a was incorporated in the Act, therefore, now sufficient income should be taken. In the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kishan Gopal & another's case (supra) , it was held that income of the deceased in case the deceased is a child between the age group of 10 to 15, the annual income of the deceased should be taken as Rs.30,000/- p.a. In the present case, the deceased was 15 years old at the time of accident, therefore, his income is to be taken to the tune of Rs.30,000/- per annum. The age of parents of the deceased is between 31 to 35 years, therefore, the multiplier of 16 is to be applied in view of law laid down by Smt. Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Anr., 2009(3) RCR (Civil), 77 as it was done in Kishan Gopal & another's case (supra) also. The amount of claim comes to the tune of Rs.30,000x16 = Rs.4,80,000/-. No amount is to be deducted from the said amount. Apart from that, claimants are entitled to Rs.1,00,000/- each as loss of love and affection as the deceased was a minor and claimants are further entitled to Rs.25,000/- as funeral expenses. In this way, the claimants are entitled for Rs.4,80,000/- + Rs.2,00,000/-(Rs.1,00,000+Rs.1,00,000) + Rs.25,000/- = Rs.7,05,000/-. The claimants are also entitled for interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum 14 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . from the date of filing of the petition till the realization of the whole of this amount. 25 The liability to make the payment is joint and several of all the respondents. However, the insurance company i.e. respondent no. 3 is required to make the payment as vehicle in question was insured one vide insurance policy Ex R-6 and respondent no.3 is bound to indemnify the respondent no. 2, registered owner of the vehicle in question. The ld. counsel for the respondent no.3 has taken an objection that the permit Ex R-3 was for the territory of Punjab only while the accident has taken place in the territory of Chandigarh, therefore, the company is not liable. In this regard, this Tribunal is of the view that at the time of accident, there was no passenger in the three-wheeler and it was not being used for commercial purpose, therefore, no separate permit was required for the territory of Chandigarh. The said permit is to be considered to be valid as the present case is not a case of no permit. As such, the insurance company is liable. Reliance in this regard can be given of the law laid down by Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in Future General Insurance Co. Ltd.'s case (supra) . 26 In view of above discussion, issue no. 2 is decided in favour of claimants. 15 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . ISSUE NO. 3 : 27This issue was not specifically pressed at the time of arguments. However, otherwise also there is nothing on record to prove this issue and the copy of driving license of respondent no.1 has been placed on record as Ex.R-1. Therefore, this issue is decided against the respondent no.3. RELIEF: 28 In view of above discussion, it is held that the claimants are entitled for compensation and an award of Rs.7,05,000/- (Rs.Seven Lacs Five thousand only) is hereby passed in favour of claimants and against the respondents no.1 to 3 jointly and severally along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the realization of the whole of this amount. However, the insurance company is required to make the payment as vehicle in question was insured one. The share of compensation amount of the claimants shall be equal. The half amount of compensation shall be deposited in the bank account of the claimants on submitting copy of pass book. The half amount of compensation of claimants shall be deposited in the form of FDR in their names in any nationalized bank of her choice for a period of one year. The remaining half amount shall be released to the claimants on furnishing the bank account. Petition is accepted accordingly. There is no 16 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . order as to costs.

However, at any stage, if the answering respondent is held liable for compensation, the interest may not be awarded more than prevailing bank rate i.e. 5.75% per annum. Therefore, the claim petition may be dismissed with costs, in the interest of justice and fair play. 8 From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed vide order dated 23.9.2015:- 1 Whether Master Chhotu @ Rajbhan has died due to rash and negligent driving of respondent o.1 while driving vehicle bearing registration no.PB-11-AS-8345? OPP. 2 Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, as prayed for? OPR. 3 Whether respondent no.1 was not having a valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident? OPR-3. 4 Relief. 9To substantiate their respective claims the parties led their 7 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . evidence. 10The claimants have examined as many as two witnesses in all. Krishan Pal, eye witness of the accident was examined as PW-1. The mother of the deceased namely Smt. Sarvesh herself stepped into the witness box as PW-2. Documents Ex P-1 to Ex P-6 were tendered in evidence. Thereafter, the evidence of the claimants was closed. 11On the other hand, the respondents have not led any oral evidence. However, documents Ex R-1 to Ex R-6 were tendered in evidence and thereafter, the evidence of the respondents was closed. 12No rebuttal evidence was adduced by the claimant. 13The learned counsels for both the parties were heard. The issue wise findings with reasons thereof are as follows : ISSUE No. 1: 14To substantiate this issue, the ld. counsel for the claimants argued that to prove the accident, Krishan Pal, eye witness of the accident appeared as PW-1. He has well deposed that on 19.2.2015, he was going on the road leading from 3 BRD Air Force Station, Chandigarh to village Burail, Sector 45, Chandigarh on a rickshaw rehri and his nephew Master Chhotu @ Rajbhan who was going ahead of him paddling a cycle was hit 8 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . by a truck bearing registration no.PB-11-AS-8345 due to which he sustained serious injuries and later on died in PGI. The FIR was lodged against the driver and it was found that respondent no.1 was driving the said truck. Therefore, from the statement of claimant corroborated with registration of FIR Ex P-1 and post mortem report Ex P-2 , the rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1, the accident and the death of Chhotu in the accident are well proved. 15The learned counsels for the respondents no.1 & 2, on the other hand, opposed the arguments of learned counsel for the claimant. The ld. Counsel argued that it is wrong to say that the accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. Otherwise also, the vehicle in question was insured one, therefore, respondents no.1 & 2 are not liable to any compensation in any manner. 16The learned counsel for the respondent no.3 argued on the same lines. He further argued that the accident and rash & negligent driving is not proved from the statement of PW-1 as he is interested witness. There is no other evidence on the record to prove the accident and rash & negligent driving. The FIR is not sufficient to prove the accident and rash & negligent driving. Therefore, the alleged accident and rash & negligent driving of respondent no.1 are not proved. 17The arguments advanced by learned counsel for both the 9 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . sides are duly considered apart from perusing the record. Krishan Pal while appearing as PW-1 has deposed that on 19.2.2015 at about 4.30 p.m., he was coming on the road leading from 3BRD Air Force Station Chandigarh to village Burail, Sector 45, Chandigarh on a rickshaw rehri. His nephew Master Chhotu @ Rajbhan was going ahead of him while paddling a cycle at slow speed and on left side of the road. When Master Chhotu @ Rajbhan was crossing the Kali Bari light points, Chandigarh, at that time, a truck bearing registration no.PB-11-AS-8345 came at fast speed from their behind and after overtaking the rickshaw rehri, it struck against the cycle of Master Chhotu @ Rajbhan. The said truck did not blow any horn. As a result of the accident, Master Chhotu @ Rajbhan fell on the road and his head was crushed by the wheel of the said truck. He was taken to PGI, Chandigarh immediately where he died on 20.2.2015 due to the injuries he sustained in this accident. The truck was being driven at fast speed in rash and negligent manner by Baldev Singh. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing registration no.PB-11-AS-8345 driven by Baldev Singh. Master Chhotu @ Rajbhan was not at all at fault. A criminal case was registered against Baldev Singh for causing the accident on the basis of his statement. From the statement of PW-1 corroborated with the fact of recording of FIR and the facing of trial by the respondent no.1 and the post mortem report Ex P-2, the accident, the rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and the injuries sustained by the claimant in the accident are well established. The statement of PW-1 cannot be discarded merely on the ground that he 10 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . is interested witness. The witness has given a natural version and his confidence could not be shaken during his cross-examination. If the statement of the witness is found trustworthy, then it can be relied upon and cannot be discarded merely on the ground that witness was an interested witness. Apart from that the accident and rash and negligent driving is to be proved beyond reasonable doubt in criminal trial only. In the civil matters, like claim petitions, the accident and rash and negligent can be proved with the help of preponderance of probabilities also. Reliance in this regard can be given of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in case titled as Kusum Lata and others Vs. Satbir and others, 2011(4) LJR 512. In such circumstances, the rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and the injuries sustained by claimant in accident are well proved. 18 In view of above discussion, issue No. 1 is decided in favour of claimant. ISSUE NO. 2 : 19To substantiate this issue, the learned counsel for the claimant argued that the deceased was 15 years old, student of 8th class. He also used to help his father in agricultural activities as the claimant no.2 is an agriculturist and having about 20-25 bighas of land. To prove this fact, the claimant Sarvesh, mother of the deceased herself has stepped into the witness box who stated that her son was studying in 8th class and 11 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . was also helping his father in agricultural activities. His future monthly income may be assessed as Rs.25,000/-. In alternate, the ld. Counsel further argued that in the case titled as Kishan Gopal & anr. vs. Lala & Ors. 2013 ACJ (SC) 2594, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has taken the income of the deceased child of same age group as Rs.30,000/- per year and used the multiplier of 15 without deducting any amount. Therefore, in alternate the amount of compensation may be assessed in view of the above law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court. 20The learned counsel for respondents, on the other hand, opposed the arguments. It is argued that claimants have failed to prove the income of the deceased by way of evidence. No cogent document regarding the income has been produced , therefore, the claimants are not entitled for any claim. 21The ld. Counsel for respondent no.3 argued on the same lines. Apart from that, the ld. counsel argued that the accident has taken place in the territory of Chandigarh while the respondent no.2 was having no permit for driving the vehicle in the territory of Chandigarh. The permit has been placed by the respondent no.2 on the record as Ex R-3. A perusal of the permit reveals that it is valid for the territory of Punjab only. Therefore, if any claim is assessed by this Tribunal, then respondent no.3 is not liable to pay the compensation. 12 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . 22 The ld. counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 rebutted the arguments of ld. counsel for respondent no.3. It is argued that at the time of accident, there was no passenger in the three-wheeler and it was not being plied for commercial purpose, therefore, there was no requirement of permit at that time. In support of his arguments, ld. counsel relied upon the law laid down by the Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in case titled as Future General Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Smt. Surjo Devi and ors. FAO no.4474 of 2012 decided on 11th September 2012. 23The arguments advanced by ld counsel for both the side are duly considered part from perusing the record. As far as age of the deceased is concerned, the age is alleged to be 15 years by the claimants in the evidence. As per copy of post mortem report Ex P2, the age of the deceased was 15 years. As per copy of school leaving certificate Ex P-5, the date of birth of deceased is 1.7.2001 . As such, the age of the deceased is taken 15 years at the time of accident. 24 As far as the income of the deceased is concerned, as per copy of school leaving certificate Ex P-5, it is proved that the deceased was a student of 8th class. As per statement of PW-2 Smt. Sarvesh, mother of the deceased, the deceased was also helping his father in agricultural activities and he was hale & hearty. However, there is no cogent 13 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . documentary evidence in this regard. Therefore, the income of the deceased cannot be considered to be Rs.25,000/- per month. The schedule of the Act provides that in case of non-earning member, the income should be taken Rs.15,000/- per annum. However, Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed that sufficient time has passed when the income of Rs.15,000/- p.a was incorporated in the Act, therefore, now sufficient income should be taken. In the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kishan Gopal & another's case (supra) , it was held that income of the deceased in case the deceased is a child between the age group of 10 to 15, the annual income of the deceased should be taken as Rs.30,000/- p.a. In the present case, the deceased was 15 years old at the time of accident, therefore, his income is to be taken to the tune of Rs.30,000/- per annum. The age of parents of the deceased is between 31 to 35 years, therefore, the multiplier of 16 is to be applied in view of law laid down by Smt. Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Anr., 2009(3) RCR (Civil), 77 as it was done in Kishan Gopal & another's case (supra) also. The amount of claim comes to the tune of Rs.30,000x16 = Rs.4,80,000/-. No amount is to be deducted from the said amount. Apart from that, claimants are entitled to Rs.1,00,000/- each as loss of love and affection as the deceased was a minor and claimants are further entitled to Rs.25,000/- as funeral expenses. In this way, the claimants are entitled for Rs.4,80,000/- + Rs.2,00,000/-(Rs.1,00,000+Rs.1,00,000) + Rs.25,000/- = Rs.7,05,000/-. The claimants are also entitled for interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum 14 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . from the date of filing of the petition till the realization of the whole of this amount. 25 The liability to make the payment is joint and several of all the respondents. However, the insurance company i.e. respondent no. 3 is required to make the payment as vehicle in question was insured one vide insurance policy Ex R-6 and respondent no.3 is bound to indemnify the respondent no. 2, registered owner of the vehicle in question. The ld. counsel for the respondent no.3 has taken an objection that the permit Ex R-3 was for the territory of Punjab only while the accident has taken place in the territory of Chandigarh, therefore, the company is not liable. In this regard, this Tribunal is of the view that at the time of accident, there was no passenger in the three-wheeler and it was not being used for commercial purpose, therefore, no separate permit was required for the territory of Chandigarh. The said permit is to be considered to be valid as the present case is not a case of no permit. As such, the insurance company is liable. Reliance in this regard can be given of the law laid down by Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in Future General Insurance Co. Ltd.'s case (supra) . 26 In view of above discussion, issue no. 2 is decided in favour of claimants. 15 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . ISSUE NO. 3 : 27This issue was not specifically pressed at the time of arguments. However, otherwise also there is nothing on record to prove this issue and the copy of driving license of respondent no.1 has been placed on record as Ex.R-1. Therefore, this issue is decided against the respondent no.3. RELIEF: 28 In view of above discussion, it is held that the claimants are entitled for compensation and an award of Rs.7,05,000/- (Rs.Seven Lacs Five thousand only) is hereby passed in favour of claimants and against the respondents no.1 to 3 jointly and severally along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the realization of the whole of this amount. However, the insurance company is required to make the payment as vehicle in question was insured one. The share of compensation amount of the claimants shall be equal. The half amount of compensation shall be deposited in the bank account of the claimants on submitting copy of pass book. The half amount of compensation of claimants shall be deposited in the form of FDR in their names in any nationalized bank of her choice for a period of one year. The remaining half amount shall be released to the claimants on furnishing the bank account. Petition is accepted accordingly. There is no 16 Sarvesh vs Baldev & anr . order as to costs.

Claim Petition under Section 166 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. 1 Babu Lal v. Ran Vijay Present: Shri Ashwani Arora, counsel for the claimants. Shri A.S. Chahal, counsel for respondents No.1. Shri Vikram Satpal, counsel for respondent No.2. Shri Sunil Narang, counsel for respondent No.3. A W A R D 1.The claimant has filed this petition for grant of compensation on account of death of Smt. Muni Devi @ Munni in a motor vehicular accident. It was on 12.2.2015 at about 11.15 am, deceased and her daughter-in-law Kajal were going on foot from Sanjay Labour Colony, Chandigarh to Hallomajra after meeting their relatives. Munni Devi was going little ahead of Kajal. When they reached near Sai Trading, Sanjay Labour Colony, and when the deceased was crossing the road carefully, at that time a motorcycle bearing No. CH-01-AG-9728 came at fast speed from the side of HDFC Bank, Industrial Area, Phase I, Chandigarh without blowing any horn and struck against Munni Devi. The accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of motorcycle bearing No. CH-01-AG-9728 driven by respondent No.1. The deceased was not at all at fault. A criminal case was registered against respondent No.1 for causing this accident on the statement of Kajal. 2.It is further case of the claimants that deceased was 48 years of age at the time of accident and was working as Helper in Plot No.350, Industrial Area, Phase II, Chandigarh and was earning 10,000/- as salary. Besides this, a sum of 10,000/- be ₹ ₹ 2 Babu Lal v. Ran Vijay assessed as the value of the domestic services provided by the deceased to her family members. The deceased was hale and hearty and the claimant had suffered a huge loss due to the untimely death of deceased. All the claimants were dependent upon the income of the deceased. 3.The respondent No. 1 in his written statement stated that the answering respondent did not cause any accident. The answering respondent was having no knowledge about the injuries suffered by the deceased and attending to her by the doctors of PGI. A false case has been registered against him. The offending vehicle was duly insured with the respondent No.3. 4.The respondent No. 2 in his written statement took preliminary objections that the claim petition did not disclose any cause of action against the answering respondent. On merits, it was submitted that the answering respondent was working as Hiderman in firm M/s Sharma Industry, Plot No. 94, Phase I, Industrial Area, Chandigarh since February 2014 to till date. On 12.2.2015, the answering respondent was on duty from 8.30 am to 8.00 pm and parked his motorcycle No. CH-01-AG-9728 in front of the factory gate. At about 8.05 pm the answering respondent saw that his motorcycle was not parked at the factory gate and his motorcycle was stolen. When the answering respondent went to police station at about 9.00 pm for intimation 3 Babu Lal v. Ran Vijay for the theft of his motorcycle, he saw his motorcycle in the compound of Police Station Industrial Area, Phase I, Chandigarh. The answering respondent came to know from the police that the said vehicle was involved in an accident. The answering respondent did not know about the involvement of the vehicle in the accident and the answering respondent did not know who picked his motorcycle. The offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.3. Other averments of the claim petition have been denied. 5.Respondent No.3 in its written statement took preliminary objections that the vehicle in question was being driven in violation of the terms and conditions of the policy of insurance and the driver of the vehicle was not holding a valid and effective driving licence. Neither any accident, as alleged, took place nor the vehicle allegedly insured with the answering respondent was involved thereof. On merits, the averments made in the claim petition have been denied. 6.From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed. 1.Whether deceased Muni Devi died in a motor vehicular accident, which took place on 12.2.2015 at 11:15 am due to rash and negligent driving by respondent No.1 ? OPA. 2.Whether the claimants are entitled to compensation on account of death of Muni Devi ? If yes, from whom and to which extent ? OPA. 4 Babu Lal v. Ran Vijay 3.Whether the driver of offending vehicle was holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident ? OPR-3. 4.Relief. 7.In order to prove the assertions as made in the claim petition, claimants examined Kajal eye witness as PW.1. Claimant Raj Kumar himself stepped into the witness box as his own witness as PW.2 and Rubal Gupta, as PW.3. Thereafter, counsel for the claimant closed the evidence on behalf of the claimant. 8.The counsel for respondents No.1 closed the evidence. The counsel for respondent No.2 closed the evidence after tendering photocopy of driving licence Exhibit R1 and photocopy of Registration certificate Exhibit R2 and photocopy of insurance policy Exhibit R3 The counsel for respondent No.3 tendered into evidence copy of insurance policy Exhibit RW3/A and then closed the evidence. 9.I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and also gone through the record. My issue-wise findings are as under : Issue No. 1. Whether deceased Muni Devi died in a motor vehicular accident, which took place on 12.2.2015 at 11:15 am due to rash and negligent driving by respondent No.1? OPA. 5 Babu Lal v. Ran Vijay 10.The onus to prove this issue was on the claimants. The claimants examined Kajal, an eye witness to the occurrence, as PW.2 who deposed that on 12.2.2015 at about 11.15 am, she alongwith deceased Munni Devi were going on foot from Sanjay Labour Colony, Chandigarh to Hallomajra after meeting their relatives. Munni Devi was going little ahead of her. When they reached near Sai Trading, Sanjay Labour Colony, and when the deceased was crossing the road carefully, at that time a motorcycle bearing No. CH-01-AG-9728 came at fast speed from the side of HDFC Bank, Industrial Area, Phase I, Chandigarh without blowing any horn and struck against Munni Devi. The accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of motorcycle bearing No. CH-01-AG-9728 driven by respondent No.1. The deceased was not at all at fault. A criminal case was registered against respondent No.1 for causing this accident on her statement. In her cross-examination, she denied the suggestion that she was not present at the place of accident. She further denied the suggestion that she was not following her mother-in-law at the time of accident. She further denied the suggestion that a false case was registered against respondent No.1 on wrong facts. She also denied the suggestion that motorcyclist blew horn. She denied the suggestion that the motorcyclist was not driving his motorcycle rashly and negligently. She further deposed that they were on their extreme left side of the road, when the accident had occurred. She further 6 Babu Lal v. Ran Vijay denied the suggestion that she did not witnessed the accident. PW.2 Raj Kumar has deposed that her mother Munni Devi met with a roadside accident on 12.2.2015 and she died in PGI, Chandigarh on 13.2.2015 due to the injuries sustained in the accident. 11.Respondent No.1 has not contested the claim petition. Only he could deny the accident or explain the manner in which the accident was caused. As such adverse inference is liable to be taken against her. 12.Statement of PW.1 proves beyond doubt that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of the offending motorcycle by respondent No. 1, as it was being driven rashly and negligently by respondent No.1 and struck against Munni Devi, who died in the PGI on 13.2.2015. The postmortem report Exhibit P7 shows that cause of death was injury to the brain, which was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. 13.In view of the evidence led on record, it is proved that the deceased died due to injuries suffered by her in a motor vehicular accident, which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of the offending motorcycle by respondent No.1. This issue is accordingly decided in favour of the claimants and against the 7 Babu Lal v. Ran Vijay respondents. Issue No.2. Whether the claimants are entitled to compensation on account of death of Muni Devi ? If yes, from whom and to which extent ? OPA. 14.The deceased was a housewife. She was aged 48 years at the time of her death. In Certificate giving cause of death Exhibit P7, her approximate age is mentioned as 40 years. In the Aadhaar card, the year of date of birth of the deceased is mentioned as 1990. The accident having taken place on 12.2.2015, the age of the deceased at the time of accident was about 45 years. Multiplier of 14 is applicable. 15.There is oral statement made by PW.3 Rubal Gupta from R.K. Enterprises, who deposed that deceased was working in their concern for the last two years on daily wages and she was being paid 250/- per day. However, there is no documentary ₹ evidence to show that she was working with R.K. Enterprises at the time of her death. No other person was examined to prove the income of the deceased. There is no direct and convincing evidence on record regarding the monthly income of the deceased while working in R.K. Enterprises on daily wages. The assessment of compensation in case of death of a housewife is virtually impossible in terms of money, as a housewife takes care of all the requirements of her family including cooking of food, 8 Babu Lal v. Ran Vijay washing of clothes etc. and thus, rightly said to be a house maker. She teaches children and provides invaluable guidance to them for their future. All these chores could be performed by a maid servant, but she can never a substitute for a wife/mother, who renders selfless service to her family. Thus, in these circumstances, the income of the deceased is to be assessed keeping in view the income earned by a semi skilled worker. Accordingly, the notional income of the deceased is assessed at 6,000/- per month.₹ 16.It is well settled that no deduction is to be made from the income of the housewife towards personal expenses as the services rendered by her cannot be measured in terms of money. The claimants are to be compensated for the loss suffered by them of personal care and attention and the services which deceased was rendering gratuitously out of her love and affection. 17.By taking the income of the deceased as 6,000/- per ₹ month and applying multiplier of 14, the claimants are held entitled to get compensation of 6,000 x 12 x 14 = 10,08,000/-. ₹ ₹ In the case of Rajesh and another v. Rajbir Singh 2013(3) RCR(Civil) 170, , the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that a sum of 1.00 lac be awarded as compensation for loss ₹ of consortium and another sum of 25,000/- for funeral and last ₹ rites. Awarding said amounts to the claimants, the total amount of 9 Babu Lal v. Ran Vijay compensation to which the claimants No. 1 to 3 are entitled thus comes to 11,33,000/-. Accordingly, the claimants No. 1 to 3 are ₹ held entitled to get compensation of 11,33,000/- in equal shares. ₹ This issue to the above extent is decided in favour of claimants and against the respondents. Issue No.3. Whether the driver of offending vehicle was holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident ? OPR-3. 18.The onus to prove these issues was on respondent No.3, which has not led any evidence. However, driving licence of respondent No.1 is placed on record Exhibit R2, which shows that the respondent No.1 was authorised to drive MCWG, which is valid till 19.7.2031. It is, therefore, held that the respondent No.1 was authorised to drive a motorcycle. It is, therefore, held that respondent No.3 has failed to prove this issue, which is decided against it and in favour of respondent No.1. Issue No. 4 (Relief). 19.In view of findings on issues above, the claim petition is allowed with costs and an Award for 11,33,000/-₹ (Eleven lacs thirty three thousand) only, is passed in favour of the claimants No. 1 to 4 in equal shares. Claimants shall also be entitled to get interest @ 7.5 per cent per annum on the amount of Award from 10 Babu Lal v. Ran Vijay the date of petition till realization of the entire amount of the Award. The respondents shall be jointly and severally liable to pay the Award amount. Counsel fee is assessed as 3,000/-. ₹ Memo of costs be prepared. File be consigned to the record room.

When at about 1.00 pm respondent No.1 came driving offending CTU Bus No. CH-01-GA- 5057 at very high rash speed and in negligent manner and hit one rickshaw from behind and thereafter, it went on the footpath falling towards Hotel Management Institute and hit the claimant.

Due to the accident the claimant ₹ suffered multiple injuries on vital organs of his body including injuries on left hand and left leg. Before the accident, claimant was hale and hearty and was very efficient in his work. But due to the injuries suffered by him, he is unable to do his work and drive three-wheeler. 3.Respondents No.2 & 3 in their written statement took preliminary objections that the accident took place due to the negligence of the rickshaw-puller. On merits, it was submitted that Bus No. CH-01- GA-5057 was not insured being a Government vehicle. It was further submitted that respondent No.1 was on duty with the offending bus on 2 Shatrughan v Bhupinder Singh Route No. 4-C on 2.1.2015. He started his duty on route from Sector 43 to 43 via Sector 42/41 market, Phase VI Mohali, Maloya, Dhanas, PGI, Sector 17. When he was coming from ISBT, Sector 43, Chandigarh and reached at Sector 42 bus stop at about 12.35 pm, at that time, suddenly a rickshaw-puller came on the road from the wrong side. He could not control his rickshaw and struck with the bus from wrong side. The accident took place due to the negligence of the rickshaw-puller, as the bus was in a very normal speed. Other averments as made in the claim petition have been denied. 4.From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues have been framed: 1.Whether claimant received injuries in an accident caused by respondent No.1 while driving Bus No. CH-01-GA- 5057 in a rash and negligent manner? OPP. 2.Whether respondent No.1 was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident ? OPR. 3.Whether the claimant is entitled to compensation, if so, from whom and to which extent ? OPP. 4.Relief. 5.In order to prove the assertions as made in the claim petition, claimant has himself stepped into the witness box as PW.1. Thereafter, the counsel for the claimant closed the evidence on behalf of the claimant. 6.The respondent No.1 himself stepped into the witness box 3 Shatrughan v Bhupinder Singh as RW.1. The Government Pleader for respondents No. 2 & 3 closed the evidence. 7.I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and also gone through the record. My issue-wise findings are as under : Issue No.1. Whether claimant received injuries in an accident caused by respondent No.1 while driving Bus No. CH-01-GA-5057 in a rash and negligent manner ? OPP. 8.The onus to prove this issue was on the claimant. In order to prove this issue, the claimant himself stepped into the witness box as PW.1 and deposed that on 2.1.2015, he was standing on the footpath towards small chowk of Sectors 41/42, Chandigarh. When at about 1.00 pm respondent No.1 came driving offending CTU Bus No. CH-01-GA- 5057 at very high rash speed and in negligent manner and hit one rickshaw from behind and thereafter, it went on the footpath falling towards Hotel Management Institute and hit him. Due to the accident, he suffered multiple injuries on vital organs of his body including injuries on left hand and left leg. After the accident, he was taken to GMSH, Sector 16, Chandigarh, where he got admitted on the same day and was discharged on 8.1.2015. Raghbir Singh Vashisht, who was going on rickshaw had died in this accident. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. In his cross-examination, the claimant has denied the suggestion that respondent No.1 was driving his bus very carefully and the accident was not taken place due to his 4 Shatrughan v Bhupinder Singh negligence. 9.Respondent No.1 while appearing into the witness box as RW.1 has deposed that he was on duty as Driver No. 280 at Bus No. CH- 01-GA-5057 on 2.1.2015. He was driving the bus slowly and concisely. When the bus reached near Sector 42 Bus Stop, many girl passengers boarded the Bus. When the bus reached near the crossing of Stadium chowk, Sector 42, Chandigarh, a rickshaw-puller came from Stadium side and struck his rickshaw on the right side of the bus. The respondent No.1 took the bus towards his left side and stopped it on the footpath of left side to avoid the accident, but the rickshaw-puller struck his rickshaw on the right side of the bus without noticing the bus. 10. FIR No. 3 dated 2.1.2015, under Section 279,337 IPC was registered at Police Station Sector 36 against respondent No.1. He has never represented to any authority against his false implication. The witnesses deposed on behalf of respondent No.1 were interested witnesses. Their testimony did not inspire confidence. It was on account of high speed of the Bus and not applying brakes immediately that the occurrence has taken place All these circumstances in their totality suggest that accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent No.1. 11. It is thus clear that respondent No.1 was driving the offending vehicle in rash and negligent manner and due to his rash and 5 Shatrughan v Bhupinder Singh negligent driving he hit his vehicle against the claimant, which resulted in causing the injuries to the claimant. It is, therefore, held that claimant received injuries in the accident, which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No.1. This issue is decided in favour the claimant and against the respondents. Issue No.2. Whether respondent No.1 was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident ? OPR. 12. The offending bus was not insured with any insurance company being government vehicle, as such, there is no need to give finding on this issue. Issue No. 3. Whether the claimant is entitled to compensation, if so, from whom and to which extent ? OPP. 13. The claimant in his affidavit Exhibit PW1/A has stated that he received suffered multiple injuries on various parts of his body i.e. left hand and left leg and he was taken to GMSH, Sector 16, Chandigarh for medical treatment and he was discharged on 8.1.2015. The claimant further deposed that he was earning 12,000/- per month ₹ by plying the three-wheeler, but now he is unable to do anything and he is without any vocation. Due to the nature of work done by the claimant being physical-manual and on account of injuries suffered by him, he has become totally disabled to perform his work and he has suffered great 6 Shatrughan v Bhupinder Singh monetary loss. He could maintain the medical bills amounting to 400/- ₹ only and rest of the bills could not be maintained by him. He proved the medical bills as Exhibit P3 to P5. 14. Keeping in view the evidence led on file, the claimant is held entitled to get an amount of 400/- being the expenses incurred on ₹ medical treatment. 15. There is no evidence on record to show that the claimant was earning 12,000/- per month by plying three-wheeler. Faced with ₹ this situation, learned counsel for the claimant has stated that minimum wages as applicable during the relevant period may be taken to be the income of the claimant. According to him, minimum wages for a labourer is 7,000/- per month. As such, the monthly income of the ₹ claimant is held to be 7,000/-. Keeping in view the nature of injuries ₹ suffered by the claimant, claimant must have remained on bed for minimum period of two months. He is, therefore, held entitled to 7,000/- x 2 = 14,000/- for loss of income. ₹ 16. There is statement made by the father of the claimant claimant by way of affidavit Exhibit PW1/A that he spent sufficient amount on special diet and underwent acute pain, agony and suffering due to the accident of claimant and the claimant had to depend upon others and hired transport for going from one place to other. There was multiple injuries on various parts of his body. The claimant must have 7 Shatrughan v Bhupinder Singh been moving by engaging some conveyance. Somebody must have been accompanying him while going to hospital and also must have remained with him during the period he remained admitted in the hospital. Keeping in view these circumstances, claimant is held entitled to a sum of 5,000/- each for his attendant and transportation. The claimant must₹ have been advised protein rich diet during the period of his illness. The prices of various dietary items have been rising. The claimant is accordingly held entitled to a sum of 5,000/- for special diet. ₹ 17. The claimant must have experienced lot of pain and suffering. Various activities of the claimant must have been restricted during the period he remained under treatment. The claimant is held entitled to a consolidated sum of 5,000/- for pain and suffering and loss ₹ of enjoyment. 18.

Whether the claimant is entitled to compensation for injuries suffered by him in a motor vehicular accident, if so, to what extent and from whom ? OPP. 13. Claimant in his affidavit Exhibit CW4/A has stated that he received grievous injuries all over his body i.e. Fracture of ribs, fracture of lower shaft tibia, ladder splint in situ and other multiple injuries and he was taken to PGI, Chandigarh for his medical treatment.

CW.1 Dr. Rajneesh Sood, Medical Officer, Department of Orthopedics, GMSH, Sector 16, Chandigarh has proved the disability certificate Exhibit C1/1 and as per the disability certificate the permanent physical disability was assessed to be 5%. The doctor further deposed that due to the permanent disability, the patient will take time to get normalized and may face problem in physical task like running and lifting heavy weight etc. 15. Regarding the income being earned by claimant, he has examined Ramesh Kumar Sen, Tax Assistant, Ward (5-4), Income-tax office, Chandigarh. The witness has placed on record the Income-tax returns for the assessment years 2013-14 and 2014-15 having PAN No. AXXPK6760B filed by Rakesh Kumar Exhibit CW2/1 and CW2/2. In his cross-examination, the witness deposed that as per Income-tax return for the assessment year 2014-15 the annual income being earned by the claimant is shown as 4,30,470/-. As such, it is held that at the time of ₹ 7 Rakesh Kumar v. Anita Bansal accident, the monthly income of the claimant as per the income-tax return for the assessment year 2014-15 was 35,872/-. The claimant ₹ must have remained on bed for three months due to the injuries suffered by him in the accident and he could not do any work. As such, there was loss of income of 35,872/- x 3 = 1,07,617/-. ₹ ₹ 16. As regards permanent disability, in Raj Kumar v. Ajay Kumar and another 2011 ACJ 1 , Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that disability refers to any restriction of lack of ability to perform an activity in the manner considered normal for a human being. Permanent disability refers to the residuary incapacity or loss of use of some part of the body, found existing at the end of the period of treatment and recuperation, after achieving the maximum bodily improvement or recovery which is likely to remain for the remainder life of the injured..... Total permanent disability refers to a person's inability to perform any avocation or employment related activities as a result of the accident.....The percentage of permanent disability is expressed by the doctor with reference to the whole body, or more often than not, with reference to a particular limb. When a disability certificate states that the injured had suffered permanent disability to an extent of 45% of the left lower limb, it is not the same as 45% permanent disability with reference to the whole body..... The Tribunal has proceeded on the basis that the permanent disability of the injured-claimant was 45% and loss of his future earning capacity was also 45%. The Tribunal overlooked the fact that the disability certificate referred to 45% disability with reference to 8 Rakesh Kumar v. Anita Bansal left lower limb and not in regard to entire body. The said extent of permanent disability of the limb could not be considered to be the functional disability of the body nor could it be assumed to result in a corresponding extent of loss of earning capacity, as the disability would not have prevented him from carrying on his avocation as a cheese vendor, though it might impede in his smooth functioning.... we propose to access the permanent functional disability of the body as 25% and loss of future earning capacity as 20%. 17. In the present case, the medical board assessed the disability to the extent of 5%, which is permanent in nature. It was found that there were fracture of 5th rib and fracture lower shaft tibia. The doctor has stated that due to permanent disability the patient will take time to get normalized and may face problem in physical task like running and lifting heavy weight etc. The disability is not functional disability. Therefore, the claimant is held entitled to a lump-sum amount of 25,000/- for permanent disability. ₹ 18. There is statement made by the claimant by way of affidavit Exhibit CW4/A that he spent sufficient amount on special diet and underwent acute pain, agony and suffering due to the accident and had to depend upon others and hired transport for going from one place to other. There were fracture of 5th rib and fracture lower shaft tibia. He must have been moving by engaging some conveyance. Somebody must have been accompanying him while going to hospital and also must have 9 Rakesh Kumar v. Anita Bansal remained with him during the period he remained admitted in the hospital. Keeping in view these circumstances, claimant is held entitled to a sum of 10,000/- each for his attendant and transportation. The ₹ claimant must have been advised protein rich diet during the period of his illness. The prices of various dietary items have been rising. Claimant is accordingly held entitled to a sum of 10,000/- for special diet. ₹ 19. The claimant must have experienced lot of pain and suffering. Various activities of the claimant must have been restricted during the period he remained under treatment. The claimant is held entitled to a consolidated sum of 10,000/- for pain and suffering as well ₹ as loss of enjoyment. 20. In view of discussion made above, the claimant is held entitled to the various amounts as compensation for injuries suffered by him in the accident under various heads as given below : Sr. No. Head Amount( ) ₹ 1Transportation charges. 10,000/-₹ 2Compensation for engaging an attendant. 10,000/-₹ 3Compensation for special diet. 10,000/-₹ 4Pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment 10,000/-₹ 5Compensation for permanent disability 25,000/-₹ 6Medical bills 63,772/-₹ 7Loss of income 1,07,617/-₹ Total2,36,389/-₹ 10 Rakesh Kumar v. Anita Bansal 21. The claimant is accordingly held entitled to get compensation of ₹2,36,389/- for the injuries suffered by him in the accident. This issue to above extent is decided in favour of the claimant and against the respondents. Issue No.3. Whether the respondent No.2 was holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident ? OPR. 22. The onus to prove this issue was upon respondent No.3, which has not brought any evidence that respondent No.2 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence to drive the offending vehicle as on the date of accident. The driving licence of respondent No.2 is placed on record as Exhibit R2, which showed that respondent No.2 was authorised to drive MC with gear, LMV-NT-Car only, which was valid upto 15.1.2027. As such, it is held that the respondent No.2 was having valid driving licence at the time of accident. This issue is, therefore, decided against respondent No.3 and in favour of respondents No.2. Issue No.4 (Relief). 23. In view of findings on issues above, the claim petition is allowed with costs and an Award for ₹2,36,389/- (Two lacs thirty six thousand three hundred and eighty nine) only, is passed in favour of the claimant and against the respondents.

Rs.75 lacs has been claimed for the loss suffered due to permanent disability, loss of earning, loss of earning capacity, loss of future prospects, expenditure on medicine, conveyance and special diet, loss of social status, mental agony for pain & suffering past, present and future life, expenditure on attendant, loss of enjoyment of future life, entertainment of guests, marriage prospectus etc. 4Notice to respondents was issued. However, respondent No.1 did not appear despite service and was proceeded against ex parte. The remaining respondents appeared and contested the claim petition. Respondent no.2 filed written statement stating therein that the claimants have not attached any proof regarding the monthly income. It is submitted that the vehicle of respondent No.2 has been falsely involved by the claimant 4 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . just to create a ground for compensation etc. It is denied that the alleged accident had taken place with the vehicle of respondent No.2. It is submitted that false FIR has been lodged against the vehicle of respondent No.2 which has been lodged by the complainant in connivance with the police officials just to get compensation. Therefore, the present claim petition be dismissed with costs. 5Respondent No.3 filed written statement taking preliminary objections that the claim petition is vague, incomplete, does not disclose any cause of action and on this ground the claim petition is liable to be dismissed. The replying respondent takes up all the defences available under Section 147, 149, 157 and 170 of M.V .Act. It reserves its right to amend the pleadings if new facts come to the light during the pendency. No such accident took place with the alleged vehicle No.HR-03-L-1120. The respondent No.1 driver of the alleged offending vehicle was not driving the vehicle at the time of alleged accident and also was not having a valid and effective driving license and the owner was having knowledge of the same. In that case answering respondent is not liable to indemnify the owner even if the claimant proves to get any compensation. Respondent No.2 owner of the offending vehicle was not having valid RC, route permit and insurance policy, fitness certificate and respondent is not liable to indemnify the owner. 6While replying on merits it is submitted that no information about the alleged accident has been received from respondent No.2 as per the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. The amount claimed is 5 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . highly exaggerated. No such accident has ever taken place with the alleged vehicle. Rest of the averments are denied. It is alleged that the claim petition be dismissed against the replying respondent with heavy costs. 7.Respondent No.4 filed separate written statement admitting the accident but denied that she was at fault. It is submitted that the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of driver of vehicle No.HR- 03L-1120 alone.The claimant has falsely implicated the replying respondent in the present claim case and filed a false claim petition against her. It is only the driver of vehicle No.HR-03L-1120 who has caused the accident and alone is responsible for the same and a FIR was also registered on the complaint of replying respondent against the driver of vehicle No.HR-03L- 1120. Therefore, claim petition be dismissed with costs in the interest of justice. 8.Respondent No.5 filed similar and identical written statement as filed by respondent No.4. 9.Respondent No.6 filed written statement taking preliminary objection therein that the claim petition filed is incomplete, vague and does not disclosed any cause of action. The claim petition has been filed in contravention of the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The claimants are not entitled to any compensation under the M.V .Act or the law of Torts as the claimants have not suffered any monetary loss. The driver of Activa Honda registration No.CH-04-A-9562 was not holding a valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident. The respondent 6 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . takes up all the pleas available under Sections 147, 149, 157 and 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. 10.While replying on merits, it is submitted that the Activa Honda bearing registration No.CH-04-A-9562 was not insured with the answering respondent. In case the owner of the Activa Honda bearing registration No.CH-04-A-9562 produces the original policy of insurance then the answering respondent reserves its right to file the amended written statement. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. Therefore, the claim petition may be dismissed with costs. 11.From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed:- 1.Whether accident dated 13.5.2013 at about 2.30 PM resulting in juries to claimant Arti occurred on account of rash and negligent driving of vehicle No.HR-03-L-1120 by respondent No.1? OPP. 2 Whether the claimant is entitled to compensation for the injuries suffered in the accident, if so, to what extent and from whom? OPP. 3 Whether the driver of offending vehicle was not holding a valid effective driving license on the date of accident and the vehicle was being driven in violation of the terms and conditions of the insurance policy? OPR3. 4 Relief. 12.To substantiate their respective claims the parties led their evidence. 13The claimant examined two witness in all. The claimant herself stepped into the witness box as PW-1. Dr.Rajesh Chhabra, Department of 7 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . Neuro Surgery, PGI, Chandigarh & Member of Disability Board was examined as PW-2. Documents Ex P-1 to Ex P-132 were tendered in evidence. Thereafter, the evidence of the claimant was closed. 14On the other hand, respondent No.4 Chetna Anand herself apepared in the witness box as RW-1. Documents Ex.R1 & Ex.R2 tendered by respondents No.4 & 5. Ld.counsel for respondent No.2 tendered documents Ex.R2/1 to Ex.R2/3. Documents Ex.R3/1 & Ex.R3/2 were tendered by respondents No.3. Thereafter, evidence was closed by all the respondents. 15No rebuttal evidence was adduced by the claimants. 16The learned counsels for both the parties were heard. The issue wise findings with reasons thereof are as follows : ISSUE No. 1: 17To substantiate this issue, the learned counsel for the claimant argued that the accident took place due to composite negligence of respondents No.1 and respondent No.4 i.e. the driver of the offending car and Activa Honda respectively. The accident is well proved from the statement of PW1 Arti who is the claimant/eye witness and her statement is further corroborated by documentary evidence, the copy of FIR is on the record as Ex.P126 which proves the accident and the copy of the discharge and follow up card of the claimant is on the record as Ex.P1 which proves that she sustained injuries in the accident. Composite negligence is also 8 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . proved from the statement of PW1. 18.The learned counsel for the respondent no.2, on the other hand, opposed the arguments of learned counsel for the claimant. It is argued that from the evidence adduced by the claimant, the accident and rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 is not proved. In alternate it is argued that at the time of accident the respondent No.1 was having valid driving license, RC and insurance policy. 19.Learned counsel for respondent No.3 also argued on the same lines. Apart from that learned counsel argued that identification of respondent No.1 i.e. driver is not properly proved in the present matter. Though in the present matter claimant stated that the accident has taken place due to composite rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 but in the State case she and another eye witness Chetna have not identified the driver i.e. respondent No.1 and he has been acquitted by the learned Trial Court in that case for the said offence. The copy of the said judgment is on record as Ex.R3/1. The claimant has stated in her cross-examination before the learned Trail Court that she has not seen the accused which is well observed in the said judgment in para 8. The another witness of that case Chetna Anand supported the case of the prosecution in her examination-in- chief but in her cross-examination she stated that she cannot state who was driving the offending vehicle. This is also well observed in para 8 of the above said judgment, therefore, the said witness cannot be relied upon in 9 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . this matter. Hence, the accident and rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 is not proved. 20.Learned counsel for respondents No.4 & 5 argued that the rash and negligent driving of respondent No.4 is not proved in the present matter. PW1 Ms.Arti has admitted in her cross-examination that driver of the Activa respondent No.4 was not at fault. Moreover, the FIR is against the car driver and not against the driver of the Activa. In such circumstances the respondent No.4 is not liable for the accident. Even respondent No.4 Chetna Anand has appeared as RW1 and denied the accident by way of her rash and negligent driving and nothing otherwise could be extracted during her cross- examination. Therefore, her rash and negligent driving is not proved nor her rash and negligent driving by way of composite negligence is proved. 21. Learned counsel for respondent No.6 also argued on the same line as that of respondents No.4 & 5. He also stated that in view of cross-examination of PW1 the rash and negligent driving of respondent No.4 is not proved and her composite negligence is also not proved. 22.The learned counsel for the claimant rebutted the arguments advanced by learned counsel for respondents. It is argued that PW1 Arti was not confronted with her previous statement, therefore, the said statement is not binding on her. In support of his arguments learned counsel relied upon the law laid down by Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in case titled as Sukhjit Singh Vs. Dharampal and other FAO No.1305 of 1992 (O&M) decided on 27.1.2011. Moreover, the judgment of acquittal passed by 10 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . learned Trial Court is not binding on this Court. In support of his arguments learned counsel relied upon the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as Dulcina Fernandes & ors. Vs. Joaquim Xavier Cruz & anr. 2013(4) RCR (Civil)(SC) 751 and law laid down by Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in case titled as Bagga Vs. Smt.Manjeet Kaur and others FAO-6381-2011(O&M) decided on 7.3.2014. Therefore, the accident and rash and negligent driving is well proved. 23The arguments advanced by learned counsel for both the sides are duly considered apart from perusing the record. As far as the accident is concerned, the accident is proved in the present case from the statement of PW1 Ms.Arti. Her statement is supported by document also as FIR was lodged after the accident the copy of which is Ex.P126. Apart from that RW1 has also admitted the accident though she stated that the accident has not taken place due to her rash and negligent driving. In such circumstances from the evidence available on the record the accident is well proved. Apart from that the accident and rash and negligent driving is to be proved beyond reasonable doubt in criminal trial only. In the civil matters, like claim petitions, the accident and rash and negligent can be proved with the help of preponderance of probabilities also. Reliance in this regard can be given of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in case titled as Kusum Lata and others Vs. Satbir and others, 2011(4) LJR 512. 24.Now it is to be seen that whether the accident has taken place due to composite rash and negligent driving of respondents No.1 & 4. In this 11 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . regard this Tribunal is of the view that as regard to composite negligence the claimant is maily relying upon the statement of PW1 Ms.Arti. In her cross- examination she has well admitted that respondent No.4 was not at fault and accident has taken place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. There is no other evidence on record to prove the composite negligence. In such circumstances, the composite negligence is not proved rather it is made out that the accident has taken place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. 25.Now the objection of learned counsel for respondent No.2 is that in the State case PW1 has not identified the driver and stated that she does not know who was driving the car. RW1 Arti has also deposed in her statement in that case that she has not seen the driver. In such circumstances learned counsel alleged that the identity of the driver is not proved. In this regard this Tribunal is of the view that the present petition is to be decided as per evidence adduced in the present petition and as per evidence adduced in the present petition, identity of respondent No.1 is well proved from the statement of PW1 Arti and FIR Ex.P126 . Moreover, she is not confronted with her previous statement. In such circumstances, she is to be relied upon. Reliance in this regard can be placed on the law laid down by Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in case titled as Sukhjit Singh Vs. Dharampal and other FAO No.1305 of 1992 (O&M) decided on 27.1.2011. Moreover, the judgment of acquittal passed by learned Trial Court is not binding on this Court. Reliance in this regard can also be placed on the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as Dulcina 12 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . Fernandes & ors. Vs. Joaquim Xavier Cruz & anr. 2013(4) RCR (Civil) (SC) 751 and law laid down by Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in case titled as Bagga Vs. Smt.Manjeet Kaur and others FAO-6381- 2011(O&M) decided on 7.3.2014. Therefore, the accident by way of rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 is well established. 26 In view of above discussion, issue No. 1 is decided in favour of claimant. ISSUE NO. 2 : 27To substantiate this issue, the learned counsel for the claimant has pressed that the claimant has suffered 50% disability which is permanent and functional disability, therefore, it is to be treated as 100% and compensation may be assessed by using multiplier. In support of his arguments learned counsel relied upon the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as Rekha Jain Vs. National Insurance Co. Ltd. 2013(3) RCR (Civil)(SC) 996. As far as income of the injured is concerned, she was a student and her income is to be assessed at the rate of Rs.10,000/- per month. In support of his arguments, the ld. Counsel relied upon the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as V . Mekala vs. M. Malathi and another 2014(2) RCR (Civil) 880. She is entitled for future prospects also. The claimant is entitled for future medical expenses also. In support of his arguments learned counsel relied upon the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as Kavita Vs. Deepak and others 2012(4) RCR(Civil) (SC) 273 . Compensation under 13 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . usual heads may be granted. 28. Learned counsel for respondents on the other hand opposed the arguments. It is argued that the disability has been assessed as 50% and it is to be taken as 50% only or less than 50% as it is not functional disability. The multiplier method cannot be used. The medical expenses could not be proved by the claimants, therefore, the claimant is not entitled for any compensation. 29.The arguments advanced by learned counsel for both the sides are duly considered apart from perusing the record. As far as the income of the claimant is concerned there is nothing on the record to establish the income of the claimant. Learned counsel for the claimant is pressing to assess the income of the claimant as Rs.10,000/- in view of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in V .Mekala's case (supra). In this regard this Tribunal is of the view in that case the injured was a professional degree holder while it is not so in the present case. The injured was not professional degree holder in the present matter, however, she is stated to be 22 years old at the time of accident, therefore, her income is to be assessed as per collector rate i.e. at the rate Rs.7500/- per month. The annual income comes to the tune of Rs.90,000/-. As far as disability is concerned it is described as 50% permanent disability as the right side of the body of the claimant has been affected. She will be having difficulty while using right hand and she requires a continuous physiotherapy. In such circumstances the functional disability is assessed as 60%. Reliance in this regard can be given of the law 14 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Rekha Jain's case (supra). She is entitled compensation for loss of income, accordingly it comes to the tune of Rs.90,000x60/100=Rs.54,000/- per annum. Keeping in view her age in view of the law laid down in Smt. Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Anr., 2009(3) RCR (Civil), 77 , the multiplier of 18 is to be applied. In this way she is entitled for compensation to the tune of Rs.54000x18=9,72,000/-. As far as future prospects is concerned, the claimant has claimed the future prospectus @ 50%. She is entitled for the same in view of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in V . Mekala vs. M. Malathi and another 2014(2) RCR (Civil) 880 as she was 22 years old at the time of accident. Therefore, 50% future prospectus of the injured comes to the tune of Rs.4,86,000/-. 30The medical bills have been placed on record from Ex.P46 to Ex.P125 for the amount of Rs.84,337/-. The claimant is entitled for the same. Besides that, the claimant is also entitled for future medical expenses particularly for physiotherapy amounting to Rs.2,00,000/-. Reliance in this regard can be given of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kavita's case (supra). The marriage prospects of claimant have diminished and as such she is entitled compensation for loss of marriage prospects to the tune of Rs.1,00,000/-. The claimant is entitled for Rs.50,000/- for pain & suffering. She is also entitled for loss of opportunities to the tune of Rs.50,000/-. Rs.50,000/- are assessed for hospitalization & healthy diet. In this way, the claimant is entitled for the following expenses:- 15 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . Loss of future income = Rs.9,72,000/- Future prospectus (50%) = Rs.4,86,000/- Medical Expenses = Rs.84,337/- Future Physiotherapy expenses = Rs.2,00,000/- Marriage prospects =Rs.1,00,000/- Pain & suffering = Rs.50,000/- Hospitalization & Healthy diet = Rs.50,000/- Loss of opportunity =Rs.50,000/- _____________ Total = Rs.19,92,337/- _____________ 31The total amount comes to the tune of Rs.19,92,337/- i.e. Rs. Rs.19,93,000/- when taken in round figure. The claimant is entitled for the same. The claimant is entitled for interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the realization of the whole of this amount. 32 As far as liability is concerned, it has been held that respondent No.1 was rash and negligent in driving car No.HR-03L-1120. The offending car was owned by respondent No.2 and was insured with respondent No.2. As such, the liability to make the payment is joint and several of the respondents no.1 to 3. However, the insurance company i.e. respondent no.3 is required to make the payment as vehicle in question was insured one vide insurance policy Ex.2/1-Ex.3/2 and respondent No.3 is bound to indemnify the respondent no.2, the owner of the vehicle in 16 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . question. 33 In view of above discussion, issue no. 2 is decided in favour of claimant accordingly. ISSUE NO. 3: 34This issue was not specifically pressed at the time of arguments. However, otherwise also there is nothing on record to prove this issue and the copy of driving license of respondent no.1 has been placed on record as Ex.2/3. Therefore, this issue is decided against the respondent no.3. RELIEF: 35. In view of above discussion, it is held that the claimant is entitled for compensation and an award of Rs.19,93,000/- (Rs.Ninteen lacs ninty three thousand only) is hereby passed in favour of claimant and against the respondents no.1 to 3 jointly and severally along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the realization of the whole of this amount. However, the insurance company i.e . respondent No.3 is required to make the payment as vehicle in question was insured one. 36The half amount of compensation of claimant shall be deposited in the bank account of the claimant on submitting copy of pass book. The half amount of compensation of claimant shall be deposited in the 17 Arti vs. Sakun Ahmed & Ors . form of FDR in her name in any nationalized bank of her choice for a period of one year.

My issue-wise findings are as under : Issue No.1. Whether claimant received injuries in an accident caused by respondent No.1, while driving vehicle No. CH-01-U-2468 in a rash and negligent manner ? OPP. 9.The onus to prove this issue was on the claimant. In order to prove this issue, the claimant herself stepped into the witness box as PW.1 and deposed that on 28.5.2015 at about 11.00 am, she alongwith her friend namely, Smt. Santosh was coming back to her house on foot from Burail and when they reached near Dev Samaj College, Sector 45, Chandigarh, on the Sector 46 road, in the meanwhile, respondent No. 1 came on the wrong side from Sector 46 side on her Kinetic Honda No. CH-01-U-2468 and hit her directly and due to the impact of the same, she fell down on the road and suffered serious injuries including fracture on 4 Kamla v. Rani her right leg. She was taken to GMCH, Sector 32, Chandigarh, where she was operated and the doctor concerned inserted plates in her right leg. She remained admitted in the hospital till 31.5.2014. The accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of Kinetic Honda No. CH- 01-U-2468 being driven by respondent No.1. In her cross-examination, she has denied the suggestion that no accident took place on 28.5.2014. She further denied the suggestion that she did not suffer any fracture or serious injury. She further denied the suggestion that no plate was inserted in his right leg or that she was not operated upon. She further denied the suggestion that she did not suffer any permanent disability. She also denied the suggestion that no accident took place with vehicle No. CH-01-U-2468. Her testimony is corroborated by PW.2 Santosh, who was an eye witness of the accident and on whose statement the present FIR was recorded. 10. Respondent No.1 while appearing in the witness box has deposed that claimant has filed a false and fabricated FIR. The claimant never met with any accident with her scooter. She further deposed that the alleged accident took place on 25.5.2014 and FIR was lodged on 4.6.2014 by one Smt. Santosh. The claimant did not make any statement to police till 24.6.2014. Thereafter, on 24.6.2014, the police officials of Police Station Sector 34, Chandigarh seized her scooter No. CH-01-U- 2468. She was arrested on 24.6.2014 in case FIR No. 253 dated 4.6.2014, Police Station Sector 34, Chandigarh. 5 Kamla v. Rani 11. As stated above, claimant has recorded in her statement that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the driver of the Kinetic Honda in question by respondent No.1. Respondent No.1 is also facing trial for causing this accident. She has never represented to any authority against her false implication. All these circumstances in their totality suggest that accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent No.1. 12. It is thus clear that respondent No.1 was driving the offending vehicle in rash and negligent manner and directly hit the claimant, which resulted in causing the injuries to the claimant. It is, therefore, held that claimant received injuries in the accident, which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No.1. This issue is decided in favour of the claimant and against the respondents. Issue No.2. Whether the claimant is entitled to compensation, if so, from whom and to which extent ? OPP. 13. The claimant in her affidavit Exhibit CW1/A has stated that after the accident, she was taken to GMCH, Sector 32, Chandigarh, where the concerned doctor inserted plates in her right leg. She remained admitted in the hospital till 31.5.2014. She spent more than 1 lac on her ₹ medical treatment. She is still under treatment from OPD of GMCH, Sector 32, Chandigarh. She has to engage an attendant to look after her 6 Kamla v. Rani and doing the household work. Before the accident, she was having good health and was enjoying her life. But due to the unfortunate accident, she could not do her household work. She also not able to walk properly and walking with the help of walker. She has become permanently disabled due to the injuries suffered by her in the accident. Her husband is a Government employee and the medical charges as per Exhibit CW1/1 have been reimbursed to him by his department for the medical treatment of the claimant. As such, the claimant is not entitled to any compensation for her medical treatment. 14. The claimant has not examined any doctor to prove the injuries sustained by her in the accident.

Whether deceased Shreekant Kumar died in a motor vehicle accident, which took place on 9.3.2015 at about 1.00 pm due to rash and negligent driving by respondent No.1? OPA. 10. The onus to prove this issue was on the claimants. In order to prove this issue, the claimant No.1 Neetu herself stepped into the 4 Neetu Devi v. Rakesh Kumar witness box as PW.1 and deposed that she is widow of deceased Shreekant Kumar, who met with a roadside accident on 9.3.2015 and died due to the injuries sustained in this accident. PW.4 Nand Lal is the eye witness to the accident. He has deposed that on 9.3.2015, he was going from Industrial Area, Phase II, Chandigarh to Hallomajra, while driving a motorcycle.

As a result of which, deceased fell down on the road and suffered multiple injuries on vital organs of his body including head injury. He was taken to GMCH, Sector 32, Chandigarh, where the doctors on duty declared him brought dead. The aforesaid truck was being driven at fast speed and in a rash and negligent manner by respondent No.1. The deceased was not at fault. A criminal case was registered against respondent No.1 for causing this accident on the basis of his statement. In his cross-examination, the witness denied the suggestion that alleged accident occurred/took lace due to rash and negligent driving of driver of truck bearing registration No. HR-37-D-0149. He further denied the suggestion that he was not present at the spot of accident. He deposed that the place where the alleged accident took place was very busy road and traffic was moving at snail pace. He denied the suggestion that the alleged accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of 5 Neetu Devi v. Rakesh Kumar deceased Shreekant Kumar @ Bablu. He further denied the suggestion that the deceased received injuries due to his own fault, as he was driving his motorcycle at high speed. He further denied the suggestion that the truck was at the speed of 5 to 10 km per hour. He further denied the suggestion that false FIR was registered against respondent No.1. 11. Respondent No.1 has not contested the claim petition. Only he could deny the accident or explain the manner in which the accident was caused. As such adverse inference is liable to be taken against him. 12. As stated above, PW.4 is the author of the FIR being an eye witness to the occurrence. He has recorded in his statement that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the driver of the vehicle No. HR-37-D-0149. Respondent No.1 is also facing trial for causing this accident. He has never represented to any authority against his false implication. All these circumstances in their totality suggest that accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent No.1. 13. There is further evidence that deceased sustained injuries in the accident leading to his death. The postmortem report is Exhibit P9. The cause of death was stated to be cranio cerebral damage due to injuries suffered. The injuries were antemortem in nature. It is, therefore, held that deceased died as a result of injuries sustained by him in a motor 6 Neetu Devi v. Rakesh Kumar vehicular accident, which was caused by rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1. This issue is decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. Issue No.2. Whether the claimants are entitled to compensation on account of death of Shreekant Kumar, if yes, from whom and to which extent ? OPA. 14. PW.1 Neetu Devi is the wife of the deceased.

She further denied the suggestion that an amount of₹ 50,000/- was spent on the funeral and last rites of the deceased. She₹ further deposed that her father-in-law and mother-in-law were staying with her and they were dependent upon the income of her late husband. 15. PW.5 Shree Gopal has deposed that he used to look after the entire salary accounts and affairs of M.D. Sales since 2010. Deceased Shreekant Kumar @ Bablu was working with M.D. Sales as skilled 7 Neetu Devi v. Rakesh Kumar carpenter expert in modular kitchen, manufacturing and wooden work from August 2014 on the monthly salary of 18,500/-. He was very ₹ efficient in his carpentary work and his promotion was due in the month of August 2015. He has tried to prove the salary being earned by the deceased by placing on record the salary certificate Exhibit PW5/1. He has tried to produce the attendance record showing that the deceased was employed with them. This cannot be believed, as the salary for each month disbursed to the deceased was not brought on record. He has admitted that he has not brought any salary record, as they were not maintaining salary record of any employee. He has also admitted that they were not maintaining any record of any employee as such therein. He has also admitted that they have not given the record regarding the employment of the deceased to the labour department. He has also admitted that they have not made any payment through cheque. No record of the bank can be produced from where it can be proved that amount of 18,500/- was paid to the deceased every month. There is also ₹ no record of the ESI or the Provident Fund being deducted of the deceased. In this situation, it is assumed that the salary certificate produced by the claimants cannot be taken to be the real proof of the salary being disbursed to the deceased. However, the deceased is only considered as a skilled labourer and his income is assessed to be 10,000/- per month. ₹ 16. As per postmortem report Exhibit P9, the deceased was 25 years of age at the time of his death. Multiplier of 18 is applicable. 8 Neetu Devi v. Rakesh Kumar Giving 50% increase due to loss of future income, in view of the law laid down in Santosh Devi v. National Insurance Company, 2012 STPL (Web) SC 248, the total income of the deceased comes to 15,000/- per month. ₹ 1/3rd of the income is liable to be deducted as personal expenses of the deceased, which comes to 5,000/-. The balance comes to 10,000/-. ₹ ₹ Applying multiplier of 18, the loss of dependency comes to 21,60,000/-. ₹ 17. In the case of Rajesh and another v. Rajbir Singh 2013(3) RCR(Civil) 170, , the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that a sum of 25,000/- be awarded as compensation for funeral and last rites. ₹ Awarding said amounts to the claimants, the total amount of compensation to which the claimants No. 1 to 4 are entitled thus comes to 22,85,000/-. Accordingly, the claimants are held entitled to get₹ compensation of 22,85,000/-. ₹This issue to the above extent is decided in favour of claimants and against the respondents. Issue No. 3. Whether the driver of offending vehicle was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident ? OPR-3 18. The onus to prove this issue was on the respondent No.2, which has not led any evidence. However, driving licence of respondent No.1 is placed on record Exhibit R1, which shows that the respondent No.1 was authorised to drive MCWG and LMV , TRANS and MLVCAB which was valid till 8.5.2013. It is, therefore, held that the respondent No.1 was authorised to drive the offending vehicle. It is, therefore, held 9 Neetu Devi v. Rakesh Kumar that respondent No.2 has failed to prove this issue, which is decided against it and in favour of respondent No.1. Issue No.4 (Relief). 19. In view of findings on issues above, the claim petition is allowed with costs and an Award for 22,85,000/- ₹(Twenty two lacs eighty five thousand) only, is passed in favour of the claimants No.1 to 4 to the extent of wife - 40%, and claimants No.2 to 4 – 20% each and against the respondents .

My issue-wise findings are as under : Issue No.1. Whether deceased Ram Kumar died in a motor vehicle accident, which took place on 4.5.2013 at about 3 PM due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 ? OPA. 10. The onus to prove this issue was on the claimants. In order to prove this issue, the claimant No.1 Bala herself stepped into the witness box as PW.1 and deposed that her husband died on 16.6.2013 due to injuries sustained in road accident which took place on 4.5.2013. PW-2 Karam Singh was the eye witness and deposed that on 4.5.2013, the deceased persons namely Rajesh Kumar and Ram Kumar were going on motorcycle bearing No.HR-04C-1860 which was being driven by deceased Rajesh at a moderate speed and on the correct left hand side of the road, whereas other deceased was riding pillion on the same motorcycle. They were going to village Malikpur, Tehsil Bilaspur for finalising a contractual work of construction. The witness was also accompanying them alongwith his friend Nirmal Singh on separate motorcycle. At about 3 PM, when the deceased persons namely Ram Kumar and Rajesh reached near the fields of Ram Karan S/o Sadhu Ram 5 Bala Vs. Ram Karan Village Gadhouli, in the meantime the offending car bearing registration No.HR-04-B-9961 came from the opposite side at very high speed, rashly and negligently driven by respondent no.1, hit the motorcycle on which the deceased persons were travelling and they fell down in the road side hole alongwith their motorcycle and many people assembled at the spot of accident. The witness with the help of others took both Ram Kumar and Rajesh for treatment in General Hospital, Naraingarh.

The deceased died due to the injuries sustained in this accident. FIR N.135 dated 17.5.2013, Under Section 279, 337 IPC was registered in police station Naraingarh, on the basis of his statement. In his cross-examination, witness deposed that he was real brother of both the deceased and his statement was not recorded by the police on the date of accident and there was gap of 13 days between date of accident and date of FIR. The witness denied the suggestion that false FIR was recorded with the police. He further denied the suggestion that he was not present on the spot of accident or that he was not eye witness to the accident. He also denied the suggestion that he was deposing at the behest of claimant being interested witness and real brother of deceased. He also denied the suggestion that no accident took place as alleged in FIR because of negligence of respondent no.1. He further denied the suggestion that deceased was not denied due to injuries sustained in the accident. 11. Respondent No.1 has not contested the claim petition. 6 Bala Vs. Ram Karan Only he could deny the accident or explain the manner in which the accident was caused. As such adverse inference is liable to be taken against him. 12. Respondent no.3 argued that the claimant has failed to prove that Ram Kumar died on account of injuries sustained by him in the accident occurred on 4.5.2013. He claimed that Ram Kumar died on 16.6.2013 and it was not proved that the injuries were so grievous that is resulted into death after a period of one and half month. However, Dr. Yogesh Jindal, Director General Hospital, sector -17, Jagadhari has duly proved that the deceased was in the ICU and he had suffered injuries which could be dangerous to life. The deceased was poor person and was only survived on the daily earnings and he was not having any source of income on the basis of which a prolonged hospitalisation could be afforded. Discharge summary Ex.P-3 also showed that he was discharged on 10.6.2013. After his discharge from PGI, Ram Kumar was got admitted in Jindal Hospital. PW-4 has proved that the entire sequence in which the injuries were sustained and the medical treatment taken by the deceased. It is also proved that the injuries were dangerous to life and they resulted in his death. 13. As stated above, PW.2 is the author of the FIR being an eye witness to the occurrence.

Ram Karan this accident. He has never represented to any authority against his false implication. All these circumstances in their totality suggest that accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent No.1. There is no proof regarding delay in recording the FIR and the delay in recording FIR is fully explained as the deceased was belonging to a family which was only surviving on the daily earnings of the two brothers and it was not expected that the third brother who was author of the FIR Ex.PW2/1 would have rushed to the police station for recording of the FIR as his presence was necessary in the hospital where his two brothers were admitted, who were critically injured. As such delay is well explained. 14. There is further evidence that deceased sustained injuries in the accident leading to his death. The postmortem report is Exhibit P1. The cause of death was stated to be due to injuries and their complications. It is, therefore, held that deceased died as a result of injuries sustained by him in a motor vehicular accident, which was caused by rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1. This issue is decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. Issue No.2. Whether the claimants are entitled to compensation on account of death of Ram Kumar, if yes, from whom and to which extent ? OPA. 15. PW.1 Bala is the wife of the deceased. She has deposed 8 Bala Vs. Ram Karan that deceased was 40 years of age at the time of accident. The deceased was hale and hearty and was maintaining a very good health. She further deposed that the deceased was self employed and was earning a sum of 15,000/- approximately. Claimants No.1 is the wife of the deceased,₹ whereas claimants No.2 to 4 are children and claimant no.5 and 6 are parents of the deceased. All the claimants were dependent upon the income of the deceased being wife, children and parents of the deceased. In her cross-examination, she deposed that she could not produce any document regarding the income of the deceased. She placed on record medical bills Ex.P-4 to Ex.P-42 for total amounting to 58,042/-. ₹ 16. There is no documentary evidence regarding the income being earned by the deceased. Faced with this situation, learned counsel for the claimants has argued that the income being earned by a daily wager be taken as income of the deceased. Now a days, a labourer must be getting 7000/- per month. As such, the monthly income of the ₹ deceased is held to be 7,000/-. ₹ 17. As per postmortem report Ex.P-1, the age of the deceased was stated to be 40 years. As such, the deceased was aged 40 years of age at the time of his death. Multiplier of 15 is applicable. Giving 30% increase due to loss of future income, in view of the law laid down in Santosh Devi v. National Insurance Company, 2012 STPL (Web) SC 248, the total income of the deceased comes to 9100/- per month. ₹ 1/3rd of the income is liable to be deducted as personal expenses of the 9 Bala Vs. Ram Karan deceased, which comes to 2100/-. The balance comes to 7,000/-. ₹ ₹ Applying multiplier of 15, the loss of dependency comes to 12,60,000/-. ₹ 18. In the case of Rajesh and another v. Rajbir Singh 2013(3) RCR(Civil) 170, , the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that a sum of 1,00,000/- be awarded as consortium and a sum of 25,000/- for ₹ ₹ funeral and last rites. Awarding said amounts to the claimants, the total amount of compensation to which the claimants No. 1 to 6 are entitled thus comes to 13,85,000/-. The claimants are also entitled to a sum of ₹ 58,042/- being spent on medical treatment of the deceased. Accordingly,₹ the claimants are held entitled to get compensation of 14,43,042/-. ₹This issue to the above extent is decided in favour of claimants and against the respondents. Issue No. 3. Whether the driver of offending vehicle was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident ? OPR-3 19. The onus to prove this issue was on the respondent No.3, which has not led any evidence. However, driving licence of respondent No.1 is placed on record Exhibit R1, which shows that the respondent No.1 was authorised to drive HTV , which was valid till 18.10.2013.

Respondent no.1 Rajwinder Singh also stepped into witness box as RW-1 (be read as RW-2 as RW-1 has already been recorded). 10. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and also gone through the record. My issue-wise findings are as under : Issue No.1. 11. In order to prove this issue, the claimants examined Jagjit Singh, who is an eye witness and on whose statement FIR No. 32, 5 Gurjit Kaur & ors. Vs. Rajwinder Singh & ors. dated 26.3.2015 under Section 279,337 IPC was registered. PW-1 Jagjit Singh deposed that on 25.3.2015 at about 7.10 PM, he alongwith his father Surinder Pal Singh were going for an evening walk from their house No.221, Phase-XI, Mohali towards Golf Club, Phase-XI, Mohali. His father was walking ahead of him. After crossing Mohali Club, they took right turn towards Golf Club Mohali and when they covered some distance at that time a motorcycle bearing registration No.CH-01-AH- 9867 came at fast speed from their behind and after overtaking him, it struck against his father who was going on the extreme left side of the road. The said motorcycle was being driven at fast speed in a rash and negligent manner by Rajwinder Singh, respondent no.1. As a result of said accident, the deceased received serious injuries. He was initially taken to GMCH, Sector -32, Chandigarh from where he was taken to Inscol Hospital, sector -34, Chandigarh and from there he was taken to Gracian Super Specialty Mohali where he died on 27.3.2015. The police was informed and FIR was registered on the basis of his statement. In this accident, a pillion rider of the motorcycle also received injuries. His testimony is duly supported by the testimony of claimant Smt. Gurjeet Kaur. 12. The postmortem report Ex.P-2 of the deceased is placed on record and as per postmortem report the cause of death was Coma due to head injury which is antemortem in nature and is sufficient to cause death in ordinary course of nature. 6 Gurjit Kaur & ors. Vs. Rajwinder Singh & ors. 13. Respondent No.1 in his written statement admitted the accident having taken place but he stated that deceased suddenly took a turn towards right side while listening his mobile phone, due to which accident occurred. 14. The testimony of witnesses examined by claimant could not be shattered during their cross examination. Indisputably, the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No 1. FIR was recorded by the police. The respondent No.1 has not led any evidence to rebut evidence of the claimants. In this way, statements of claimant remained un-rebutted which prove that the accident was caused due to the rash and negligent act of respondent No. 1. In case, Girdhari Lal vs Radhey Shyam and others V ol. CIV-(1993-2), The Punjab Law Reporter Page 109, it was held by our own Hon'ble High Court that driver was being tried on account of rash and negligent driving, prima facie safe to conclude that the accident occurred on account of rash and negligent driving of the driver. In the instant case also, the FIR has been registered against the respondent No 1. Accordingly, it is held that the accident had occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 and thereby caused death of Surinder Pal Singh. 15. It is, thus, clear that respondent No.1 was driving the offending motorcycle in rash and negligent manner and due to his rash 7 Gurjit Kaur & ors. Vs. Rajwinder Singh & ors. and negligent driving he hit his motorcycle against the deceased, which resulted in causing the injuries to the deceased, which proved fatal for the deceased. It is, therefore, held that deceased died in the accident which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of the offending motorcycle by respondent No.1. This issue is decided in favour of the claimant and against the respondents. Issue No.2. 16. Claimant Gurjit Kaur wife of the deceased Surinder Pal Singh in her affidavit Exhibit PW2/A stated that the deceased met with an accident on 25.3.2015 and died on 27.3.2015 due to the injuries sustained in the said accident. He was 50 years of age at the time of accident and his date of birth was 19.3.1965. He was hale and hearty and was maintaining good health. He was working as an Administrator with Sri Sukhmani Institute of Hotel Management on monthly salary of Rs.10,000/-. Besides this, he had retired as Sergeant from Indian Air Force and was also getting pension of Rs.25,000/-. All the claimants suffered irreparable loss due to untimely death of the deceased as they all were dependent on the income of the deceased. When cross-examined, she denied that her husband was more than the age as mentioned in her affidavit. She also denied that her husband was not employed anywhere after his retirement. 17. Claimants also examined PW-3 Sudesh Sharma, Admn. 8 Gurjit Kaur & ors. Vs. Rajwinder Singh & ors. Officer Sri Sukhmani Institute, who produced the authority letter Ex.P-10 and attested copy of detail of salary and salary certificate of Surinder Pal Singh, who was working as Administrator clerk since 2008, Ex.P-11 and Ex.P-12 respectively. 18. PW-4 Shweta Niam, Senior Manager, Oriental Bank of commerce produced the statement of account of late Surinder Pal singh, who was an Ex-serviceman and was getting pension through their bank vide account No.11972151000504. Copy of statement of account of Surinder Pal Singh is Ex.P-13. Last pension amount drawn by him was Rs.11,894/- per month. 19. The date of birth of deceased Surinder Pal is mentioned as 19.3.1965 in his official record Ex.P-3. From the salary certificate Ex.P-12, it is established that deceased was getting salary of Rs.7971/- at the time of accident and from statement of account Ex.P-13, it is established that deceased was getting pension of Rs.11894/- at the time of accident. Accordingly, the total monthly income of the deceased Surinder Pal Singh can be assessed to be Rs.19,865/-. The claimants placed on record medical bill Ex.P-15 amounting to Rs.40,967/-. There is no dispute regarding the same, therefore, the claimants are entitled to amount of Rs.40,967/- on account of medical bills. 20. As per copy of official record Ex.P-3, the deceased was 9 Gurjit Kaur & ors. Vs. Rajwinder Singh & ors. 50 years of age at the time of his death. Therefore, in view of the judgment Smt. Sarla Verma and others vs Delhi Transport Corporation and another, 2009(6) SCC 121, multiplier of 13 is applicable. 1/3rd of the income is liable to be deducted as personal expenses of the deceased, which comes to 13243/-. Thus, the annual dependency comes to Rs. ₹ 1,58,916/- and after applying multiplier of 13, the loss of dependency comes to Rs.20,65,908/-. 21. In the case of Rajesh and another v. Rajbir Singh 2013(3) RCR(Civil) 170, , the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that a sum of 1,00,000/- be awarded as consortium, a sum of 25,000/- for ₹ ₹ funeral and last rites and a sum of 20,000/- on account of love and ₹ affection to claimants no.2 and 3. Awarding said amounts to the claimants, the total amount of compensation to which the claimants No. 1 to 3 are entitled comes to 22,10,908/-. The claimants are also entitled to ₹ a sum of 40967/- being spent on medical treatment of the deceased. ₹ Accordingly, the claimants are held entitled to get compensation of 22,51,875/-. ₹This issue to the above extent is decided in favour of claimants and against the respondents. Issue No.3. 22. Onus to prove this issue was upon respondent no.1 but respondent no.1 neither adduced any evidence nor produced the copy of his driving licence. On the other hand, respondent no.3 examined RW-1 10 Gurjit Kaur & ors. Vs. Rajwinder Singh & ors. Prabhjot, Ahlmad in the Court of Bisman Mann, JMIC, Mohali who stated that as per record, there is no driving licence of Rajinder Singh on record file brought by him titled State of Punjab Vs. Rajwinder Singh. Thus, it is held that the respondent no.1 was not having valid driving license to drive motorcycle in question. However, motorcycle bearing No.CH-01AH-9867 was insured with respondent no.3, for which respondent insurance company is liable to pay amount of compensation as agitated above. Therefore, at the first instance the insurance company will pay the amount of compensation to the claimants but respondent no.3 will have the right to recover the amount from the respondents no.1 and 2. This issue is decided accordingly. Issue No.4 (Relief). 23. In view of findings on above issues, the claim petition is allowed with costs and an Award for Rs.22,35,875/- (twenty two lacs, thirty five thousand, eight hundred seventy five only), is passed in favour of claimant No.1 (wife) to the extent of - 50% and claimant No.2 and 3 to the extent of -25% each and against the respondents.

Shalu & others Vs. Anil & others 279 & 337 of Indian Penal Code against respondent no.1. Despite lengthy cross-examination, respondents could not impeach credibility of PW-1 Ravi Kumar. 15.Though, the plea taken up by respondents No. 1 & 2 was that a false case was got registered by the applicants, against respondent No. 1, involving canter, belonging to respondent No. 2, but to substantiate this plea no evidence was led by respondents No. 1 & 2. Respondent No. 1 Anil Kumar, driver of the offending vehicle, thought it unnecessary and wasteful to step in the witness box to rebut, what had been stated by PW-1 Ravi. Reluctance of respondent No. 1 to step into the witness box also raises a presumption that plea put up on behalf of the respondents is without merit. There is nothing on record to suggest that respondent No. 1 ever approached higher police authorities alleging that he was falsely implicated in the criminal case and that the accident did not take place on account of his rash or negligent act and his mere silence in the matter rather goes against him. As the first respondent, driver of the offending vehicle did not come forward to deny his negligence, adverse inference is to be drawn in favour of the claimants and the driver of offending vehicle is presumed to be negligent, if any authority is needed, reference may be made to Inder Singh Versus Haryana State, 1987 ACJ 94 and Raju & others Versus Sukhwinder Singh & others, 2006(4) Recent Civil Reports 82 (P&H) . Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. Shalu & others Vs. Anil & others 16.Further, contents of First Information Report, copy of which is Exhibit-P-1, also corroborate the plea of the applicants as regards the factum and manner of occurrence. It has not been disputed on behalf of the respondents that the offending vehicle belonged to the respondent no.2. Even otherwise as per copy of registration certificate, Exhibit R3, of the offending vehicle, respondent no.2 was registered owner of the offending vehicle. 17.Even otherwise, the Tribunal, in terms of Section 166 of the Act, is not required to hold a regular trial but, according to scheme of Act, it holds an enquiry for adjudication of claims for award of compensation in respect of accidents involving the death or bodily injury to persons, arising out of use of motor vehicles. The adjudication of claim in these proceedings has to be made on the preponderance of probabilities. The quality of evidence and not the quantity thereof, in totality of circumstances, clearly proves the involvement of the respondent no.1 and the offending vehicle bearing registration no. HP72-A-6079 for the accident in question. As per copy of post-mortem report of deceased Exhibit P2, the deceased had died in motor vehicular accident on 16.07.2015. 18.In view of above discussion it is proved on record that respondent no.1 Anil Kumar caused the accident, while driving the offending vehicle belonging to respondent no.2 in a rash and negligent Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. Shalu & others Vs. Anil & others manner, resulting into death of the deceased. Therefore, this issue is decided in favour of the applicants and against the respondents. Issue No. 2: 19.Onus to prove this issue was upon the applicants who were required to prove that they were entitled to claim compensation and its extent as also liability of the respondents to pay the compensation. 20.In this case, applicants claimed compensation amounting to Rs.75,00,000/- on account of death of deceased Rocky in motor vehicle accident. As per case of the applicants, the deceased was aged 24 years and was earning a sum of Rs.12,000/- per mensem by working as daily wager with Sanitation Department under the Health Department of Municipal Corporation, Chandigarh. In order to prove aforesaid occupation of the deceased, applicant no.1 Shalu, widow of the deceased herself stepped into the witness box as PW-2 to depose that her husband was working as a daily wager with Sanitation Department under the Health Department of Municipal Corporation, U.T., Chandigarh and was earning a sum of Rs.12,000/- per mensem. However, no document was placed on record to prove that the deceased was working in the aforesaid department. Had the deceased been working in the said department, as claimed by the applicants, they could get the requisite record produced in this behalf but in the absence of any record in this behalf, it cannot be said that the deceased was working as daily wager with Sanitation Department Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. Shalu & others Vs. Anil & others under the Health Department of Municipal Corporation, U.T., Chandigarh as alleged by the applicants. In the situation, plea of the applicants that the deceased was earning an amount of Rs.12,000/- per mensem by working in Sanitation Department of Municipal Corporation, Chandigarh cannot be accepted and rather, it is to be taken that the deceased was working as un-skilled labourer. Learned counsel for the applicants has placed on record the list of minimum rates of wages payable for monthly and daily rated employees for the relevant period according to which unskilled labourer was being paid a sum of Rs.7,961/- per month during the above said period. In the present case, the accident took place on 16.07.2015. As such, the monthly income of the deceased is assessed as Rs.7,961/-. 21.As regards age of the deceased, it is the case of the applicants that the deceased was aged 24 years. However, in copy of post mortem report of the deceased, Exhibit P-2, his age has been recorded as 20 years. No evidence has been brought on record by the appearing respondent to show that age of the deceased at the time of his death was more than 24 years. However, it is pertinent to mention here that the age in the postmortem report normally got mentioned by approximation and as such, age of deceased is to be taken as 24 years, as claimed by applicants. 22.In view of law laid down by Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in Rajesh & others versus Rajbir Singh & others, 2013 ACJ Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. Shalu & others Vs. Anil & others 1403 (Full Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court) 50% additions are permissible even in case of persons below 40 years who are self employed or having fixed wages. By allowing 50% additions to the income of the deceased, monthly income of the deceased comes to Rs.11,941/- (Rs.7,961/- + Rs.3,980/- (50%) and in the situation, annual income of the deceased comes to Rs.1,43,292/-. 23.As regards dependency of applicants on the deceased, it is pertinent to mention here that applicant No. 4 Rakesh Kumar alias Rakesh, being father of deceased cannot be said to be dependent upon the deceased unless contrary is proved. Moreover, applicant Shalu while appearing as PW-2 stated during her cross examination that her father-in- law is labourer and as such, it cannot be said applicant No. 4 Rakesh Kumar was dependent upon the income of deceased and accordingly, number of dependents left behind the deceased was four in number. 24.In terms of Smt. Sarla Verma & others Versus Delhi Transport Corporation & another 2009(3) RCR (Civil) 77: 2009(3) RAJ 373, as the number of dependents left behind by the deceased was four (applicant No. 1 widow, (applicants No. 2 & 5 minor children and applicant No. 4 mother), his 1/4th of the assessed income has to be deducted towards expenditure of the deceased upon himself. Thus, net loss of dependency comes to Rs.1,43,292/- minus Rs.35,823/- = Rs.1,07,469/- per annum. Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. Shalu & others Vs. Anil & others 25.As the deceased was 24 years at the time of his death, in terms of Smt. Sarla Verma & others versus Delhi Transport Corporation & another (supra) a multiplier of 18 needs to be applied. Thus, amount of compensation payable to the applicants comes to Rs.19,34,442/- (Rs.1,07,469/- x 18). In view of law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Rajesh & others Versus Rajbir Singh & others (supra) , amount of Rs.1,00,000/- is awarded to applicant No. 1 towards loss of consortium, amount of Rs.1,00,000/- is awarded to applicants No. 2 & 5, minor children, for loss of love, care and guidance and amount of Rs.25,000/- on account of funeral expenditure. Thus, total amount of compensation comes to Rs.21,59,442/-. 26.As discussed above, offending vehicle owned by respondent no.2 was being driven by respondent no.1 and as per copy of insurance policy of the offending vehicle, Exhibit R-4, the offending vehicle was insured with respondent no.3 at the time of the accident. 27.In these circumstances, all the respondents shall be jointly and severally liable to make payment of compensation to the applicants. Thus, issue no.2 is decided in the aforesaid terms in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. Issue no.3:- 28. Onus to prove this issue was upon the respondent no.3. Photocopy of driving licence of respondent no.1 was placed on record as Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. Shalu & others Vs. Anil & others Exhibit R-1 and respondent No. 3-Insurance Company examined RW-1 Parvesh Kumar, License Clerk, R.L.A. Office, Amb, District Una (H.P.), who deposed that fake licence, extract of which was proved as Exhibit R6, was issued in favour of respondent No. 1 by Data Entry Operator and he (respondent No. 1) was accordingly issued notice, copy of which has been proved on record as Exhibit R7. He further deposed that services of Data Entry Operator namely Ankush Dhiman were terminated vide order dated 10.08.2015 (copy Exhibit R8). It was argued on behalf of respondent No. 3 that since licence held by respondent No. 1 was fake, therefore, respondent No. 3 was not liable to pay the compensation. 29.On the other hand, Pardeep Gupta, owner of offending canter, while appearing as RW-2 deposed that while employing respondent No. 1 as his driver he had checked his driving skills and only thereafter, he was given employment; that he had seen driving licence of respondent No. 1, copy Exhibit R1. However, during cross-examination, he admitted that he did not produce licence of respondent No. 1 before any licensing authority and he was volunteered to depose that he himself checked driving skills of respondent No. 1. 30.Respondent No. 2 being owner was supposed to get verified the licence of respondent No. 1 before giving him employment and he cannot be absolved simply on the ground that he himself checked the Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. Shalu & others Vs. Anil & others driving skills of respondent No. 1 because he is not an authorized person in this behalf. In this view of the matter, since the driving licence held by respondent No. 1 was fake, therefore, insurer cannot be made liable to make payment of compensation. However, insurer may be asked to satisfy the third party claim and then recover the said amount from the insured by executing the award like a decree against him as there is no dispute to the fact that the offending vehicle was insured with respondent No. 3 on the day of accident. Therefore, it is held that at the first instance, it shall be the liability of respondent No. 3 to make the payment of compensation. However, respondent No. 3 may recover the amount of compensation from respondent No. 2 by initiating proceedings before the executing Court. This issue is accordingly decided in the aforesaid terms in favour of respondent No. 3 and against respondent No. 2. Relief: 31.As a result of the findings on above issues, compensation of Rs.21,59,442/- is awarded in favour of applicants No. 1, 2, 3 & 5 and against the respondents.

She was taken to GMCH, Sector 32, Chandigarh on 6.4.2014 and 11-13 stitches were applied on her head. Plaster of paries was also applied on her left leg for a period of six month. Due to non-union of bones, claimant was taken to MAX Hospital, Phase 6, Mohali and she was admitted on 1.9.2014 and was operated on 2.9.2014 and knailing was done. Thereafter, the claimant was discharged on 3.9.2014. Thereafter, she remained under the follow-up treatment of MAX Hospital, Mohali upto February , 2015. She had to spend a sum of 6 Manju Mangla v. Balbir Singh 4,00,000/- on her medical treatment. However, she could maintain bills₹ amounting to 16,180/- and rest of the bills could not be maintained by ₹ her, as she was in serious condition. Till date, the claimant is undergoing medicines for the recovery of injuries. The husband of the claimant is a Government Servant and he had submitted medical bills amounting to 81,262/- for reimbursement and had received 56,208/- only and rest of₹ ₹ the amount was not reimbursed. She proved the bills from Exhibit P11 to P62. As such, she is entitled to get 16,180/- only for her medical ₹ treatment. 15. PW.2 Dr. Ravi Pareenja, Assistant Professor, Department of Orthopedics, GMCH, Sector 32, Chandigarh has deposed that the patient Manju Mangla was brought to Emergency of GMCH, Sector 32, Chandigarh with the history of roadside accident on 6.4.2014. The patient was diagnosed with fracture both bone left leg. Thereafter, the patient went to Max Hospital on 11.4.2015. The doctor further deposed that the patient was a post operative case of fracture both bones left leg with stiffness left knee and ankle. The patient was permanently physically disabled by 20%. The patient will have difficulty in squatting cross leg sitting and stair climbing. The doctor proved the disability certificate as Exhibit P61.

However, a sum of 7,000/- per month is taken as her income ₹ 7 Manju Mangla v. Balbir Singh for the domestic services rendered by her to her family. 17. As regards permanent disability, in Raj Kumar v. Ajay Kumar and another 2011 ACJ 1 , Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that disability refers to any restriction of lack of ability to perform an activity in the manner considered normal for a human being. Permanent disability refers to the residuary incapacity or loss of use of some part of the body, found existing at the end of the period of treatment and recuperation, after achieving the maximum bodily improvement or recovery which is likely to remain for the remainder life of the injured..... Total permanent disability refers to a person's inability to perform any avocation or employment related activities as a result of the accident.....The percentage of permanent disability is expressed by the doctor with reference to the whole body, or more often than not, with reference to a particular limb. When a disability certificate states that the injured had suffered permanent disability to an extent of 45% of the left lower limb, it is not the same as 45% permanent disability with reference to the whole body..... The Tribunal has proceeded on the basis that the permanent disability of the injured-claimant was 45% and loss of his future earning capacity was also 45%. The Tribunal overlooked the fact that the disability certificate referred to 45% disability with reference to left lower limb and not in regard to entire body. The said extent of permanent disability of the limb could not be considered to be the functional disability of the body nor could it be assumed to result in a corresponding extent of loss of earning capacity, as the disability would 8 Manju Mangla v. Balbir Singh not have prevented him from carrying on his avocation as a cheese vendor, though it might impede in his smooth functioning.... we propose to access the permanent functional disability of the body as 25% and loss of future earning capacity as 20%. 18. In the present case, the medical board assessed the disability to the extent of 20% with respect to left lower limb. The disability is permanent in nature and it is a functional disability. 19. The claimant was aged 44 years on the day of accident. Taking his monthly income as 7,000/-, 30% of the monthly income ₹ comes to 1,400/-. Applying multiplier of 14, the total loss of income ₹ comes to 2,35,00/-. ₹ 20. There is statement made by the claimant by way of affidavit Exhibit PW1/A that she spent sufficient amount on special diet and underwent acute pain, agony and suffering due to the accident and had to depend upon others and hired transport for going from one place to other. There was head injury, fracture both bones left leg and other multiple injuries. She must have been moving by engaging some conveyance. Somebody must have been accompanying her while going to hospital and also must have remained with her during the period she remained admitted in the hospital. Keeping in view these circumstances, claimant is held entitled to a sum of 5,000/- each for her attendant and ₹ transportation. The claimant must have been advised protein rich diet 9 Manju Mangla v. Balbir Singh during the period of her illness. The prices of various dietary items have been rising. The claimant is accordingly held entitled to a sum of 10,000/- for special diet. ₹ 21. The claimant must have experienced lot of pain and suffering. Various activities of the claimant must have been restricted during the period he remained under treatment. The claimant is held entitled to a consolidated sum of 10,000/- for pain and suffering as well ₹ as loss of enjoyment. 22. The claimant remained on bed for about six months and she did not do any work during that period. As such, the loss of income comes to 7,000/- x 6 = 42,000/-. ₹ ₹ 23. In view of discussion made above, the claimant is held entitled to the various amounts as compensation for injuries suffered by him in the accident under various heads as given below : Sr. No.Head Amount( ) ₹ 1Compensation for loss of income 42,000/-₹ 2Compensation for transportation charges 5,000/-₹ 2Compensation for engaging an attendant. 5,000/-₹ 3Compensation for special diet. 10,000/-₹ 4Pain and suffering and loss of enjoyment 10,000/-₹ 5Compensation for permanent disability 2,35,000/-₹ 6Medical charges 16,180/-₹ Total3,23,180/-₹ 10 Manju Mangla v.

In case, Girdhari Lal vs Radhey Shyam and others V ol. CIV-(1993-2), The Punjab Law Reporter Page 109, it was held by our own Hon'ble High Court that driver was being tried on account of rash and negligent driving, prima facie safe to conclude that the accident occurred on account of rash and negligent driving of the driver.

Bahadur Singh 1 and 2 has contented that the valid route permit for plying the truck was issued by competent authority as such the route permit produced by respondent no. 1 and 2 is valid. 14. I have considered the respective contentions of Ld. Counsel for the parties and have gone through the record. The contention raised by Ld. Counsel for respondent no. 3 is that there had been a violation of terms of permit in plying vehicle at the place which had not been authorized to ply. The purpose of permit is to allow a vehicle to be plied on the road. A violation of any other term then the purpose for which the permit was to operate will not be a defence which will be available in the scheme of Motor Vehicles Act. Reference can be made to the decision of Supreme Court in case National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Chella Bharathamma, 2004 AIR (SC) 4882. Being so, it is held that the respondents no. 1 and 2 were holding valid documents at the time of accident. This issue is decided accordingly. Relief:- 15.

Chandigarh. When the claimant was near Poultry Farm located on the main Chandigarh-Ambala Road at that time respondent Sandeep Tiwari driving his motorcycle observing traffic rules, rashly and negligently hit the claimant. The head of the claimant struck on the road with great force causing severe and grievous injuries. The claimant was taken to GMCH-32, Chandigarh where he remained admitted for one and half month. The head injury has not healed up. The water was accumulated in the head as told by the doctors. Due to the head injury the petitioner has become paralytic and disabled and totally dependent on his family 3 Jaggu Yadav Vs. Sandeep Tiwari members for all his needs and requirement. The claimant has lost control over all his limbs. The wife of claimant is housewife. Compromise as contained in DDR No.41 dated 7.5.2015 was obtained by force of police and leaders on the family of claimant. The compromise was not signed by the claimant and compromise has been got signed from his wife and son. However, Rs.20,000/- were given to family to force compromise and high profile terms and conditions were included in compromise. 3The claimant was 45 years old at the time of accident, doing the job of washing of vehicles in workshop of M/s Krishan Automobiles, Phase-I, Industrial Area, Chandigarh and getting salary of Rs.7000/- p.m. Apart from above he also used to earn Rs.3000/- per month by doing odd labour jobs after office hours.

It is submitted that no accident took place and as such no FIR was lodged. The motorcycle in question was insured. Therefore, the claim petition may be dismissed with costs, in the interest of justice. 6Respondents No.2 to 4 filed joint written statement taking preliminary objections stating therein that the answering respondent has been wrongly impleaded as a respondent as the vehicle bearing No.CH-04K-1547 was not insured with the answering respondent Insurance Company on the date of accident i.e. 7.5.2015. The driver of the vehicle in question was not holding a valid and proper driving license. The claimant has not given any intimation about the policy particulars and the driving license thus violating the terms and condition of the policy. The claimant has no locus standi to file the present petition. The claim petition has been filed in connivance and collusion with respondent No.1 in order to extract compensation. 7While replying on merits, the averments as contained in the preliminary objections are reiterated. It is alleged that the claimant 5 Jaggu Yadav Vs. Sandeep Tiwari has wrongly mentioned the name of the insurance company as respondents No.2 to 4. However, the policy particulars vide which the vehicle was insured with respondent-company have not been given and in the absence of the same the answering respondent has been wrongly impleaded as a respondent and is not liable to indemnify the owner even if the claim petition is allowed by this Tribunal. Further the policy is subject to 64 VB confirmations. It is submitted that no acc ident took place with the vehicle bearing No.CH-04K-1547. The answering respondent has been wrongly impleaded as respondent and is not liable to indemnify the owner. It is averred that even if the claimant produce the insurance policy at a later stage the vehicle was being driven in violation of the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and the insurance company is thus not liable to pay any compensation. The rest of contents of the claim petition were denied. It is alleged that the claim petition be dismissed with costs. 8From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed:- 1.

OPP. 2 Whether the claimant is entitled to compensation for the injuries suffered in the accident, if so, to what extent and from whom? OPP. 3.Whether the driver of offending vehicle was not holding a valid & effective driving license on the date of accident and the vehicle was being driven in violation of the terms and conditions of the insurance policy? OPR 2 to 4. 6 Jaggu Yadav Vs. Sandeep Tiwari 4. Relief. 9To substantiate their respective claims the parties led their evidence. 10The claimant examined seven witnesses in all. The claimant Jaggu Yadav himself stepped into the witness box as PW1. Kiran wife of claimant was examined as PW2. Ramesh the brother of wife of claimant was examined as PW3. Harieshwar Prashad the neighbour of the claimant was examined as PW4. L/C Harmeet Kaur, Police Station Industrial Area, U.T. Chandigarh was examined as PW5. Rita, Front Office (Field) Manager, M/s Krishana Auto Sales who produced record regarding salary of claimant was examined as PW5/X. Surjit Singh, Assistant, ESI Corporation, Sector 29, Chandigarh was examined as PW6. Dr.Nitin Gupta, Assistant Professor, Department of Orthopaedic and Member of Disability Board, GMCH-32 was examined as PW7. Documents Ex.PW2/A, Ex.PW5/A, Ex.PW5/B, Ex.PW6/A to Ex.PW6/F, Ex.PW7/1 were tendered in evidence. Thereafter, the evidence of the claimant was closed. 11On the other hand, respondent No.1 tendered copy of DL, copy of RC and copy of Insurance Policy as Ex.RW1/1 to Ex.RW1/3 respectively. Thereafter, evidence was closed by all the respondents. 12No rebuttal evidence was adduced by the claimant. 7 Jaggu Yadav Vs. Sandeep Tiwari 13The learned counsels for both the parties were heard. The issue wise findings with reasons thereof are as follows : ISSUE No. 1: 14.To substantiate this issue, the Ld. counsel for the claimant argued that from the statement of PW1 who was injured/eye witness supported by DDR report Ex.PW2/B, FIR Ex.PW5/A and the other evidence, the accident, rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 and the injuries caused to the claimant are well proved, therefore, he is entitled for compensation. 15 Learned counsel for respondent No.1 on the other hand opposed the arguments. It is argued that the claimant has failed to prove the accident and the injuries caused to the claimant by way evidence. Moreover, as per Ex.PW2/B the matter has been compromised between the parties and sufficient compensation has been paid by respondent No.1, therefore, the claimant is not entitled for any compensation. Learned counsel for respondents No.2 to 4 also argued on the same lines and stated that the accident and injuries are not proved, therefore, the claimants are not entitled for any compensation. 16.The arguments advanced by learned counsel for both the sides are duly considered apart from perusing the record. As far as the accident is concerned, the accident is well proved from the DDR 8 Jaggu Yadav Vs. Sandeep Tiwari Ex.PW2/B vide which matter was compromised between the parties. The matter was compromised only because there was accident. Now it is to be seen whether it was caused due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. In this regard statement of claimant who was injured/eye witness and appeared as PW1 in the witness box is relevant for the decision of the present matter. He has well deposed in his statement that on 7.5.2015 he was going on his bicycle to attend his duties. When the claimant was near Poultry Farm located on the main Chandigarh Ambala Road, respondent Sandeep Tiwari came there driving his motorcycle without observing traffic rules and driving the same rashly and negligently at high speed. The motorcycle of respondent No.1 hit the claimant due to which the claimant fell down and his head struck on the road with force. He sustained injuries. Nothing otherwise could be extracted during his cross-examination, therefore, the accident by way of rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 and injuries to the claimant are well proved. FIR has also been placed on record Ex.PW5/A but it cannot be safely relied upon and the version of the claim petition and the FIR is different. In the claim petition and the evidence it is not mentioned by the claimant that his son was with him but in the FIR it is mentioned that his son was with him at the time of accident. The contents of the FIR appears to be an afterthought. It cannot be relied upon but as already stated the accident by way of rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 are well proved. 9 Jaggu Yadav Vs. Sandeep Tiwari 17. In view of above discussion, issue No. 1 is decided in favour of claimant. ISSUE NO. 2 : 18.Ld.counsel for the claimant argued that the claimant was earning Rs.8188/- per month and certificates in this regard are on the record as Ex.PW5/A and Ex.PW5/B. He was having other income also by doing extra labour work. He has sustained 75% disability which is proved by PW7 Dr.Nitin Gupta and disability certificate is on record Ex.PW7/1, therefore, the claimant is entitled for compensation by using multiplier method. He is entitled for compensation under usual heads also. 19. Learned counsel for the respondent No.1 on the other hand opposed the arguments. It is argued that the matter has already been compromised between the parties and compensation has been paid to the claimant by respondent No.1. The payment upto Rs.20,000/- has been admitted by the claimant in his claim petition though more amount is claimed. The claimant has filed the present claim petition only in the greed of more money. Hence, the petition may be dismissed. Learned counsel for respondents No.2 to 4 also argued on the same lines. Learned counsel further argued that the expenditure has already been reimbursed to the claimant which is well proved from the statement of PW6 who has admitted in his cross- 10 Jaggu Yadav Vs. Sandeep Tiwari examination that all the expenditure has been reimbursed to the claimant and the claimant will get pension in future. Therefore, there is no monetary loss to the claimant. Hence, the claim petition may be dismissed. 20.Arguments advanced by learned counsel for the parties are duly considered apart from perusing the record. As far as the income of the claimant is concerned, the income is well proved from the statement of PW5 Rita and salary certificates are placed on record as Ex.PW5/A & Ex.PW5/B. He was getting Rs.8188/- per month. Now the contention of the respondents is that the matter has been compromised and further the claim has been reimbursed for the expenditure of treatment and he is getting the pension also, therefore, he is not entitled for any compensation. While the contention of the claimant is that he is entitled for compensation. In this regard this Tribunal is of the view that as the claimant has been reimbursed for the expenditure of treatment and he is getting pension also, therefore, he is not entitled for all those claims. However, he is entitled for future prospects and compensation for pain and suffering because this compensation has not been given to the claimant. 21. As far as future prospects are concerned as already stated the income of the claimant is Rs.8188/- per month, as a matter of convenience the income is taken in round figure as Rs.8200/- per 11 Jaggu Yadav Vs. Sandeep Tiwari month and the annual income comes to 8200x12=Rs.94,400/-. 75 % of the same comes to 98400x75/100=Rs.73,800/- p.a. As far as the age of the claimant is concerned he has pleaded that he was 45 years of age at the time of accident. However, from the perusal of the documents i.e. salary certificate Ex.PW5/A and ESI document Ex.PW6/A the date of birth of the claimant is mentioned as 17.2.1963. As per these documents the claimant was 52 years of age at the time of accident. Claimant is 52 years old, therefore, multiplier of 11 is to be used in view of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Smt. Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Anr., 2009(3) RCR (Civil), 77 . The total income/amount for the purpose of calculation of future prospects comes to the tune of Rs.73800x11=Rs.8,11,800/- and on that amount the claimant is entitled for future prospects. As he was 52 years old at the time of accident, therefore, he is entitled for 15% increase as future prospectus. Reliance in this regard can be placed upon the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case titled as Rajesh and ors. vs. Rajbir Singh and ors. 2013(3) RCR (Civil) 170 . The loss of future prospects comes to the tune of Rs.8,11,800/-x15/100=Rs.1,21,770/-. The claimant is entitled for said future prospects to the tune of Rs.1,21,770/-. The claimant is also entitled to Rs.50,000/- on account of pain & suffering for the injuries sustained by him. The claimant is also entitled for Rs.25,000/- for hospitalization and healthy diet. The claimant has admitted that he has received Rs.20,000/- from respondent No.1, 12 Jaggu Yadav Vs. Sandeep Tiwari therefore, the said amount is liable to be deducted from the given amount. In this way, the claimant is entitled for the claim as under:- Loss of future prospectus = Rs.1,21,770/- Pain & Suffering = Rs. 50,000/- Hospitalization & healthy diet = Rs. 25,000/- _____________ = Rs.1,96,770/- _____________ Minus amount already received (-)= Rs. 20,000/- ------------------- Total= Rs.1,76,770/- –------------------ 22.The total amount comes to the tune of Rs.1,76,770/- i.e. Rs.1,77,000/- while taking in round figure. The claimant is entitled for the same. The claimant is entitled for interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the realization of the whole of this amount. 23.The liability to make the payment is joint and several of all the respondents. However, the insurance company i.e. respondent no.2 to 4 is required to make the payment as vehicle in question was insured one vide insurance policy Ex .RW1/3 and respondent no.2 to 4 is bound to indemnify the respondent no.1, registered owner of the vehicle in question. 24 In view of above discussion, issue no. 2 is decided in favour of claimant accordingly. 13 Jaggu Yadav Vs. Sandeep Tiwari ISSUE NO. 3: 25This issue was not specifically pressed at the time of arguments. However, otherwise also there is nothing on record to prove this issue and the copy of driving license of respondent no.1 has been placed on record as Ex.RW1/1. Therefore, this issue is decided against the respondent no.2 to 4. 26 In view of above discussion, issue no. 2 is decided in favour of claimant accordingly. RELIEF: 27 In view of above discussion, it is held that the claimant is entitled for compensation and an award of Rs.1,77,000/- (Rs.One Lac Seventy Seven Thousand only) is hereby passed in favour of claimant and against the respondents no.1 to 3 jointly and severally along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the realization of the whole of this amount. However, the insurance company i.e . respondent No.3 is required to make the payment as vehicle in question was insured one. 28.The amount of compensation of claimant shall be deposited in the bank account of the claimant on submitting copy of pass book. Petition is accepted accordingly with no order as to costs. 14 Jaggu Yadav Vs. Sandeep Tiwari Memo of costs be prepared accordingly. File be consigned to the record room after due compliance.

Shri Vishal Ahuja, counsel for respondent No.3. A W A R D 1.This is a claim petition preferred by the claimants for grant 1 Sharmila Vs. Ram Karan of compensation on account of death of Rajesh Kumar in a motor vehicle accident. 2.The claimants have filed the present claim petition on the averments that on 4.5.2013, the deceased was driving motorcycle bearing No.HR-04C-1860, which was pillion riding by his brother Ram Kumar, at a moderate speed and on the correct left hand side of the road. They were going to village Malikpur, Tehsil Bilaspur for finalising a contractual work of construction. They were accompanied on separate motorcycle by Karam Singh and his friend Nirmal Singh. When at about 3 PM, the deceased alongwith his brother Ram Kumar reached near the fields of Ram Karan S/o Sadhu Ram Village Gadhouli, in the meantime the offending car bearing registration No.HR-04-B-9961 came from the opposite side at very high speed, rashly and negligently driven by respondent no.1 hit the motorcycle on which the deceased was riding. The accident in question had occurred due to the rash and negligent driving by respondent no.1 while driving his car bearing No.HR-04B-9961. 3.It is further case of the claimants that deceased was aged 30 years and was working as a Mason and earning 15,000/- per month ₹ approximately. The claimant no.1 has lost her husband at the so early stage of her life due to the negligent driving of respondent no.1. The burden of upbringing the children has fallen on the shoulders of claimant no.1. There was no monitory help to the claimant no.1 from any corner. The life of claimants was spoiled and no sum of money could fill up the 2 Sharmila Vs. Ram Karan blank space which was created due to sudden demise of deceased Rajesh Kumar in the lives of claimants. The deceased was sole bread earner for the family. The deceased alongwith his brother Ram Kumar had migrated to Chandigarh for doing masonry work. The deceased used to take contracts of construction work. 4.Respondents No.1 & 2 in their written reply took preliminary objections that the claim petition was not maintainable in the present form. The present claim petition had been filed by the claimants against the answering respondent in connivance with the police authority by involving car No.HR-4B-9961 in a false case. The claimants have not impleaded the driver and owner of the motor cycle No.HR-04C-1860 which was allegedly involved in the accident as the deceased was stated to be riding on the same. On merits, it was stated that neither any accident, as alleged, took place on 4.5.2013 nor the vehicle allegedly driven by the respondent no.1 and owned by respondent no.2 was involved in any manner. The report lodged with the police station Naraingarh was also false and unbelieveable. The car in question was duly insured with respondent no.3. Respondent no.1 was holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident. The car in question was neither present at the spot nor got involved in any such accident resulting into death of Rajesh Kumar. The other averments of the claim petition have been denied. 5.Respondent No.3 in its written reply took preliminary 3 Sharmila Vs. Ram Karan objections that the driver of offending vehicle was not having a valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident. On merits, it was alleged that no accident took place on the alleged date, time and place. The deceased did not sustain any injury in the alleged accident due to which he died. The involvement of vehicle NO.HR-04B-9961 in the alleged accident was denied. Other averments made in the claim petition have been denied. 6.From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed: 1.Whether deceased Rajesh Kumar died in a motor vehicle accident, which took place on 4.5.2013 at about 3 PM due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 ? OPA. 2.Whether the claimants are entitled to compensation on account of death of Rajesh Kumar? If yes, from whom and to which extent ? OPA. 3.Whether the driver of offending vehicle was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident ? OPR-3. 4.Relief. 7.In order to prove the assertions as made in the claim petition, claimant No.1 herself stepped into the witness box PW.1. The claimants also examined Karam Singh as PW.2, Sudesh Kumar as PW-3, Dr. Amitabh Suthar, Senior Resident, Orthopedics department, GMCH- 32, Chandigarh as PW-4 and Dr. Saurabh, General surgery department, GMCH-32, Chandigarh. Thereafter, the counsel for the claimants closed the evidence on behalf of the claimants. 4 Sharmila Vs. Ram Karan 8.The counsel for respondents No.1 & 2 tendered in evidence documents Exhibit R1 to R3 and closed the evidence. The learned counsel for respondent No.3 closed evidence after tendering into evidence the insurance policy as Exhibit R-4. 9.I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and also gone through the record. My issue-wise findings are as under : Issue No.1. Whether deceased Rajesh Kumar died in a motor vehicle accident, which took place on 4.5.2013 at about 3 PM due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1? OPA. 10. The onus to prove this issue was on the claimants. In order to prove this issue, the claimant No.1 Sharmila herself stepped into the witness box as PW.1 and deposed that her husband died on 10.12.2013 due to injuries sustained in road accident which took place on 4.5.2013. PW-2 Karam Singh was the eye witness and deposed that on 4.5.2013, the deceased persons namely Rajesh Kumar and Ram Kumar were going on motorcycle bearing No.HR-04C-1860 which was being driven by deceased Rajesh at a moderate speed and on the correct left hand side of the road, whereas other deceased was riding pillion on the same motorcycle. They were going to village Malikpur, Tehsil Bilaspur for finalising a contractual work of construction. The witness was also accompanying them alongwith his friend Nirmal Singh on separate motorcycle. At about 3 PM, when the deceased persons namely Ram Kumar and Rajesh reached near the fields of Ram Karan S/o Sadhu Ram 5 Sharmila Vs. Ram Karan Village Gadhouli, in the meantime the offending car bearing registration No.HR-04-B-9961 came from the opposite side at very high speed, rashly and negligently driven by respondent no.1, hit the motorcycle on which the deceased persons were travelling and they fell down in the road side hole alongwith their motorcycle and many people assembled at the spot of accident. The witness with the help of others took both Ram Kumar and Rajesh for treatment in General Hospital, Naraingarh. The accident in question had occurred due to the rash and negligent driving by respondent no.1 while driving his car bearing No.HR-04B-9961. The deceased died due to the injuries sustained in this accident. FIR N.135 dated 17.5.2013, Under Section 279, 337 IPC was registered in police station Naraingarh, on the basis of his statement. In his cross-examination, witness deposed that he was real brother of both the deceased and his statement was not recorded by the police on the date of accident and there was gap of 13 days between date of accident and date of FIR. The witness denied the suggestion that false FIR was recorded with the police. He further denied the suggestion that he was not present on the spot of accident or that he was not eye witness to the accident. He also denied the suggestion that he was deposing at the behest of claimant being interested witness and real brother of deceased. He also denied the suggestion that no accident took place as alleged in FIR because of negligence of respondent no.1. He further denied the suggestion that deceased was not denied due to injuries sustained in the accident. 11. Respondent No.1 has not contested the claim petition. 6 Sharmila Vs. Ram Karan Only he could deny the accident or explain the manner in which the accident was caused. As such adverse inference is liable to be taken against him. 12. Respondent no.3 argued that the claimant has failed to prove that Rajesh Kumar died on account of injuries sustained by him in the accident occurred on 4.5.2013. He claimed that Rajesh Kumar died on 10.12.2013 and it was not proved that the injuries were so grievous that is resulted into death after a period of about seven months. However, Amitabh Suthar, Senior Resident, GMCH-32, Chandigarh has duly proved that the deceased was in the ICU and he had suffered injuries which could be dangerous to life. The deceased was poor person and was only survived on the daily earnings and he was not having any source of income on the basis of which a prolonged hospitalisation could be afforded. Discharge summary Ex.PW4/1 also showed that he was discharged on 21.6.2013. After his discharge from GMCH-32, Rajesh Kumar was continuously visiting the hospital. PW-4 has proved that the entire sequence in which the injuries were sustained and the medical treatment taken by the deceased. It is also proved that the injuries were dangerous to life and they resulted into his death. Learned counsel for Insurance company has argued that Rajesh Kumar died after six months of the accident. PW-4 Dr. Amitabh Suthar has deposed that the patient had also developed bedsores due to long stay in ICU and on account of non changing of sides of patient. It is a matter of common knowledge that the bedsores developed in general becomes so serious that it can lead to the 7 Sharmila Vs. Ram Karan death. The orthopedics injuries sustained by Rajesh Kumar coupled with developing of bedsores on account of long hospitalisation and also the testimony of Dr. Amitabh Suthar that it was the injury sustained in the accident which kept him to the bed for about six months proves that eventually they resulted into his death. 13. As stated above, PW.2 is the author of the FIR being an eye witness to the occurrence. He has recorded in his statement that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the driver of the car No. HR-04B-9961. Respondent No.1 has also faced trial for causing this accident. He has never represented to any authority against his false implication. All these circumstances in their totality suggest that accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent No.1. There is no proof regarding delay in recording the FIR and the delay in recording FIR is fully explained as the deceased was belonging to a family which was only surviving on the daily earnings of the two brothers and it was not expected that the third brother who was author of the FIR Ex.PW2/1 would have rushed to the police station for recording of the FIR as his presence was necessary in the hospital where his two brothers were admitted, who were critically injured. As such delay is well explained. 14. There is further evidence that deceased sustained injuries in the accident leading to his death. It is, therefore, held that deceased died as a result of injuries sustained by him in a motor vehicular accident, 8 Sharmila Vs. Ram Karan which was caused by rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1. This issue is decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. Issue No.2. Whether the claimants are entitled to compensation on account of death of Rajesh Kumar, if yes, from whom and to which extent? OPA. 15. PW.1 Sharmila is the wife of the deceased. She has deposed that deceased was 30 years of age at the time of accident. The deceased was hale and hearty and was maintaining a very good health. She further deposed that the deceased was self employed and was earning a sum of 15,000/- approximately. Claimants No.1 is the wife of the ₹ deceased, whereas claimants No.2 & 3 are children and claimant no.4 and 5 are parents of the deceased. All the claimants were dependent upon the income of the deceased being wife, children and parents of the deceased. In her cross-examination, she deposed that she could not produce any document regarding the income of the deceased. She placed on record medical bills Ex.P-3 to Ex.P-31 for total amounting to 40,817/-. ₹ 16. There is no documentary evidence regarding the income being earned by the deceased. Faced with this situation, learned counsel for the claimants has argued that the income being earned by a daily wager be taken as income of the deceased. Now a days, a labourer must be getting 7000/- per month. As such, the monthly income of the ₹ deceased is held to be 7,000/-. ₹ 9 Sharmila Vs. Ram Karan 17. As per the testimony of claimant deceased was younger brother of Ram Kumar, who was aged 40 years at the time of accident. Certainly Rajesh Kumar would have been of lesser age than Ram Kumar and his age can be assumed to be 35. As such, the deceased was aged 35 years of age at the time of his death. Multiplier of 16 is applicable. Giving 50% increase due to loss of future income, in view of the law laid down in Santosh Devi v. National Insurance Company, 2012 STPL (Web) SC 248, the total income of the deceased comes to 10,500/- per ₹ month. 1/3rd of the income is liable to be deducted as personal expenses of the deceased, which comes to 3500/-. The balance comes to ₹ 7,000/-. Applying multiplier of 16, the loss of dependency comes to₹ 13,44,000/-.₹ 18. In the case of Rajesh and another v. Rajbir Singh 2013(3) RCR(Civil) 170, , the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that a sum of 1,00,000/- be awarded as consortium and a sum of 25,000/- for ₹ ₹ funeral and last rites. Awarding said amounts to the claimants, the total amount of compensation to which the claimants No. 1 to 5 are entitled thus comes to 14,69,000/-. The claimants are also entitled to a sum of ₹ 40,817/- being spent on medical treatment of the deceased. Accordingly,₹ the claimants are held entitled to get compensation of 15,09,817/-. ₹This issue to the above extent is decided in favour of claimants and against the respondents. 10 Sharmila Vs. Ram Karan Issue No. 3. Whether the driver of offending vehicle was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident ? OPR-3 19. The onus to prove this issue was on the respondent No.3, which has not led any evidence. However, driving licence of respondent No.1 is placed on record Exhibit R1, which shows that the respondent No.1 was authorised to drive HTV , which was valid till 18.10.2013. It is, therefore, held that the respondent No.1 was authorised to drive the offending vehicle. It is, therefore, held that respondent No.3 has failed to prove this issue, which is decided against it and in favour of respondent No.1. Issue No.4 (Relief). 20. In view of findings on issues above, the claim petition is allowed with costs and an Award for 15,09,817/- ₹(Fifteen lacs nine thousand eight hundred and seventeen) only, is passed in favour of the claimants No.1 to 5 to the extent of wife - 40%, and remaining claimants No.2 to 5 – 15% each against the respondents. Claimants shall also be entitled to get interest @ 7.5 per cent per annum on the amount of Award from the date of petition till realization of the entire amount of the Award.

CLAIM PETITION/APPLICATION U/S 166 OF THE MOTOR VEHICLES ACT FOR THE GRANT OF COMPENSATION. ***** Present:Sh. Navdeep Arora, counsel for claimants. Sh. Jatin Arora, counsel for respondent no.1. Sh. Krishan Mohan, counsel for respondent no.2. Sh. Ravi Parkash, counsel for respondent no.3. AWARD The claimant has filed the present claim petition under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act for seeking compensation to the tune of Rs.50 lacs on account of injuries sustained by him caused in a road side vehicular accident. 2 Sanjeev Sharma vs. Yadwinder Singh & Ors . 2It is alleged in the claim petition that on 24.12.2014 at about 1.15 p.m., the claimant was going from Mohali to Landran while driving his motorcycle at slow speed and on left side of the road. When the claimant was near Bus Stand village Lakhnour, P.S. Sohana, at that time a car bearing regd. no.CH-04-A-0061 came at fast speed from behind and after overtaking the motorcycle of the claimant, the car was in the process of overtaking another car which was going ahead of the claimant. In that process, the car struck against a Tata Safari which was coming from opposite direction and thereafter it struck against a motorcycle which was also coming from opposite direction. Due to the impact, it turned back and struck against a car and thereafter it struck against the motorcycle of the claimant. The aforesaid car was being driven at fast speed and in rash & negligent manner by Sh.Yadwinder Singh respondent no.1. As a result of this accident, the claimant and others received serious injuries. The claimant was taken to Civil Hospital, Mohali from where he was referred to GMCH Sector 32, Chandigarh. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of car bearing registration no.CH-04-A-0061 driven by respondent no.1. The claimant and others were not at all at fault. 3The claimant was 43 years of age at the time of accident, doing business and was earning Rs.25,000/- per month. FIR no.284 dated 26.12.2014 u/s 279/337/427 of IPC was registered at Police Station Sohana, Distt. Mohali. In the accident, the claimant suffered fracture both bones distal right leg, hemipherisis right side, head injury and other multiple injuries. The doctors on duty in Civil Hospital Mohali and GMCH Sector 32, 3 Sanjeev Sharma vs. Yadwinder Singh & Ors . Chandigarh attended the injured. The claimant is under treatment since the date of accident and spent a sum of Rs.2 lacs on his medical treatment so far. Rs.50 lacs has been claimed for the loss suffered due to permanent disability, loss of earning, loss of earning capacity, expenditure on medicine, conveyance and special diet, loss of social status, mental agony for pain & suffering past, present and future life, expenditure on attendant, loss of enjoyment of future life, entertainment of guests etc. 4In response of the notice, he respondents appeared and contested the claim petition. Respondent no.1 filed written statement taking preliminary objection regarding maintainability and concealment of material facts.. It is submitted that it is denied that the deceased was doing business and earning Rs.25,000/- per month as alleged. It is submitted that the accident was not caused by rash & negligent act of respondent no.1. A false FIR no. 284 dated 26.12.2014 was got registered at Police Station Sohana, District Mohali. The answering respondent has no role in causing the accident. He was neither rash nor negligent on his part. The false FIR has been registered against the answering respondent by providing false information to the police. Therefore, the claim petition may be dismissed with costs, in the interest of justice. 5Respondent no.2 filed reply to the petition stating therein that the respondent's vehicle is not involved in any accident as alleged in the petition. It is submitted that the respondent no.2, the registered owner has sold out the said vehicle to respondent no.1 and there is no liability of any kind of accident etc on the part of respondent no.2. The said vehicle was in 4 Sanjeev Sharma vs. Yadwinder Singh & Ors . possession of the respondent no.1 at the time of alleged accident. The claimant is not entitled to get any claim from answering respondent. The total story of claimant is concocted and false. Therefore, the claim petition may be dismissed in the interest of justice. 6Respondent no.3 filed written statement taking preliminary objections that the respondent no.1 i.e. the insured has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy in as much as the respondent no.1 has not given any intimation of the alleged accident to the answering respondent. However, if in any case it is proved on record that the accident took place involving vehicle bearing registration no. CH-04-A-0061, then in that event the liability of the answering respondent will be limited and according to the terms & conditions of the insurance policy and the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, it would also be subject to the defences available u/s 147, 149, 157, 169 & 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and the provisions of the insurance policy. The answering respondent reserves its right to file an amended written statement at a later stage in the event of discovery of any other material particulars or information. The preliminary objections regarding maintainability of the petition and cause of action have also been taken. It is submitted that since no intimation of any accident has been received by the answering respondent from the owner of the vehicle, allegedly insured with it, the claim petition is not maintainable and the answering respondent is entitled to be absolved from the array of respondents on this ground alone. 7Without admitting the accident, the answering respondent 5 Sanjeev Sharma vs. Yadwinder Singh & Ors . denied its liability on the ground that the vehicle in question was being driven in violation of the terms and conditions of the policies of insurance at the relevant time and the driver of the vehicle was not holding any valid and effective driving license. Moreover, the owner of the vehicle deliberately breached the terms & conditions of the policy of insurance by not taking due precaution in checking the validity and effectiveness of driving license or driving skill of the driver and therefore, for his negligence, the answering respondent cannot be held liable. The answering respondent takes all defence available to it under the relevant applicable provisions of Motor Vehicle Act particularly u/s 147/149/157/170 and 172 of the Act. The answering respondent also takes the plea u/s 170 of M.V . Act as there seems to be collusion among the claimants and respondents no.1 and 2. The claimant has not given undertaking that no such claim petition has been filed in any court of India except this petition. If at all the liability of company is proved with interest, then company is liable to pay interest @ 6% p.a as per prevailing bank interest rate and not more than that. The answering respondent is not liable to be burdened with the interest of the award, if burdened with the liability, on the adjournment sought by the claimant to delay the proceedings of the present petition. 8While replying on merits, it is submitted that the claimant has not spent any amount on the transportation during his injuries. The compensation claimed is imaginary, excessive and exaggerated one and the claimant is not entitled for a single penny. It is further submitted that no accident took place with the vehicle no.CH-04-A-0061, as such no claim has been lodged with the company and no intimation was sent by respondents 6 Sanjeev Sharma vs. Yadwinder Singh & Ors . no.1 and 2 regarding the accident and if still this court comes to the conclusion that the accident had taken place, then that had occurred due to the negligence of the injured who was not observing traffic rules and regulations and therefore, the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. The claimant neither suffered any mental agony nor he spent any amount on the medicines and any money on the injury. It is further submitted that the claimant is not entitled to any compensation either from the answering respondent or from respondents no.1 and 2. Therefore, the claim petition may be dismissed with costs. 9From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed:- 1 Whether accident dated 24.12.2014 at about 1.15 pm resulting in injuries to claimant occurred on account of rash and negligent driving of vehicle no. CH-04-A-0061 by respondent no.1? OPP. 2 Whether the claimant is entitled to compensation for the injuries suffered in the accident, if so, to what extent and from whom? OPP. 3 Whether the driver of offending vehicle was not holding a valid effective driving license on the date of accident and the vehicle was being driven in violation of the terms and conditions of the insurance policy? OPR3. 4 Relief. 10To substantiate their respective claims the parties led their evidence. 11The claimant examined three witness in all. Dr.Ravi Kumar Preenja, Assistant Professor, Department of Orthopedics & Member of 7 Sanjeev Sharma vs. Yadwinder Singh & Ors . Disability Board, GMCH Sector 32, Chandigarh was examined as PW-1. The claimant himself stepped into the witness box as PW-2. Babbu s/o Raj Pal, the attendant was examined as PW-3. Documents Ex P-1 to Ex P-113 were tendered in evidence. Thereafter, the evidence of the claimant was closed. 12On the other hand, the ld. counsel for respondents tendered in evidence documents Ex R-1 to Ex R-4. Thereafter, evidence was closed by all the respondents. 13No rebuttal evidence was adduced by the claimants. 14The learned counsels for both the parties were heard. The issue wise findings with reasons thereof are as follows : ISSUE No. 1: 15To substantiate this issue, the Ld. counsel for the claimant argued that to prove the accident, the claimant Sanjeev Sharma himself has appeared as PW-1. He has well deposed that on 24.12.2014, he was hit by the offending car which was coming at a very high speed and in rash & negligent manner. The FIR was lodged against the driver and it was found that respondent no.1 was driving the said car. He further stated that he sustained serious injuries in the accident and the discharge and follow up cards in this regard are on the record as Ex P-2 & P-3 . Therefore, from the statement of claimant corroborated with the fact that the FIR Ex P-113 was 8 Sanjeev Sharma vs. Yadwinder Singh & Ors . registered against the respondent no.1, the rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1, the accident and the injuries sustained by the claimant in the accident are well proved. 16The learned counsel for the respondents no.1 & 2, on the other hand, opposed the arguments of learned counsel for the claimant. The learned counsel argued that the accident and rash & negligent driving is not proved from the statement of PW-2 as he is interested witness. There is no other evidence on the record to prove the accident and rash & negligent driving. The learned counsel for respondent no.3 also argued on the same lines and stated that the accident and rash & negligent driving is not proved in the present matter by way of evidence of the claimant. The FIR is not sufficient to prove the accident and rash & negligent driving. Therefore, the alleged accident and rash & negligent driving of respondent no.1 are not proved. 17The arguments advanced by learned counsel for both the sides are duly considered apart from perusing the record. The claimant Sanjeev Sharma while appearing as PW-1 has deposed that on 24.12.2014 at about 1.15 p.m., he was going from Mohali to Landran while driving his motorcycle at slow speed and on left side of the road. When he was near Bus Stand village Lakhnour, P.S. Sohana, at that time a car bearing regd. no.CH- 04-A-0061 came at fast speed from behind and after overtaking his motorcycle, the car was in the process of overtaking another car which was going ahead of him. In that process, the car struck against a Tata Safari which was coming from opposite direction and thereafter it struck against a 9 Sanjeev Sharma vs. Yadwinder Singh & Ors . motorcycle which was also coming from opposite direction. Due to the impact, it turned back and struck against a car and thereafter it struck against the his motorcycle. The aforesaid car was being driven at fast speed and in rash & negligent manner by Yadwinder Singh respondent no.1. As a result of this accident, he and others received serious injuries. He was taken to Civil Hospital, Mohali from where he was referred to GMCH Sector 32, Chandigarh. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of car bearing registration no.CH-04-A-0061 driven by respondent no.1. The claimant and others were not at all at fault. In the accident, he suffered fracture both bones distal right leg, hemipherisis right side, head injury and other multiple injuries. The doctors on duty in Civil Hospital Mohali and GMCH Sector 32, Chandigarh attended the injured. The claimant is under treatment since the date of accident. From the statement of PW-1 corroborated with the fact of recording of FIR Ex P113 and the facing of trial by the respondent no.1, the discharge and follow up cards Ex P-2 & Ex P-3, the accident, the rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and the injuries sustained by the claimant in the accident are well established. The statement of PW-1 cannot be discarded merely on the ground that he is interested witness. The witness has given a natural version and his confidence could not be shaken during his cross-examination. If the statement of the witness is found trustworthy, then it can be relied upon and cannot be discarded merely on the ground that witness was an interested witness. Apart from that the accident and rash and negligent driving is to be proved beyond reasonable doubt in criminal trial only. In the civil matters, like claim petitions, the accident and rash and negligent can be proved with the help of preponderance of probabilities also. Reliance in this regard can 10 Sanjeev Sharma vs. Yadwinder Singh & Ors . be given of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in case titled as Kusum Lata and others Vs. Satbir and others, 2011(4) LJR 512. In such circumstances, the rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and the injuries sustained by claimant in accident are well proved. 18 In view of above discussion, issue No. 1 is decided in favour of claimant. ISSUE NO. 2 : 19To substantiate this issue, the learned counsel for the claimant argued that the claimant was treated for the injuries sustained by him in the accident and he remained admitted in the hospital for one month in unconscious state and was discharged on 3.2.2015. He was again admitted in GMCH Sector 32, Chandigarh on 10.3.15 and was again operated on 17.3.15 and 25.3.15 and was discharged on 6.4.15. Till date, he is bed ridden and cannot move without any support and is under follow up treatment in GMCH Sector 32, Chandigarh. The discharge & follow up cards in this regard are Ex P-2 & Ex P-3. The ld. Counsel submitted that the injured was 43 years old, he was a businessman and used to fit Dish TVs and was earning Rs.25,000/- per month. Due to accident, the claimant is not able to work and is dependent on others for his livelihood. The ld. Counsel argued that there is 75% disability to the claimant in the present matter which is well proved from the statement of PW-1 Dr. Ravi Kumar Preenja. It is well established that the claimant is on wheel chair and is not in a position to work, therefore, it is to be treated as 100% disability. To support of his 11 Sanjeev Sharma vs. Yadwinder Singh & Ors . arguments, the ld. Counsel relied upon the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case titled as Jakir Hussein vs. Sabir and Others 2015(2) RCR (Civil) 141 and Rajan Vs. Soly Sebastian and another 2015 ACJ 2418. 20The claimant is entitled for 30% increase in his income also by way of future prospects. In support of his arguments, the ld. Counsel relied upon the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as V . Mekala vs. M. Malathi and another 2014(2) RCR (Civil) 880 and Syed Sadiq etc. vs. United India Insurance Company I(2014) ACC 206 (SC). The ld. Counsel submitted that all bills which could be saved by the claimant are on the record from Ex P-7 to Ex P-15 in the amount of Rs.16,288/-. The bills of physiotherapy are Ex P-16 to Ex P-98 in the amount of Rs.5040/- and the claimant is entitled for that. The claimant had to engage an attendant. The attendant Babbu has appeared as PW-3 and the original receipts are on the record from Ex P-99 to Ex P-112. The claimant is entitled for pain & suffering, loss of amenities, transportation, special diet etc. The compensation may be assessed accordingly. 21The learned counsel for the respondent no.1, on the other hand, opposed the arguments of the learned counsel for the claimant. The learned counsel argued that the claimant has failed to prove the accident by way of evidence, therefore, he is not entitled for any compensation. In alternate, it is argued that respondent no.1 has purchased the vehicle from respondent no.2 and he was having a valid registration certificate and driving license. There was a valid insurance of the vehicle, therefore, the liability if any, that will 12 Sanjeev Sharma vs. Yadwinder Singh & Ors . be of respondent no.3 i.e. insurance company. 22The learned counsel for respondent no.2 argued that the vehicle was sold by him to respondent no.1, therefore, there is no liability of respondent no.2. Moreover, there was a valid insurance of the vehicle and if there is any liability, that is to be fulfilled by respondent no.3. 23The learned counsel for respondent no.3 argued that the claimant has failed to prove the accident by way of evidence, he is not entitled for any compensation. Apart from that, the doctor who treated the patient has not appeared in the witness box, therefore, the injuries and the accident is not proved. On this ground also, the claimant is not entitled for any compensation. As far as the sale of vehicle by respondent no.2 to respondent no.1 is concerned, it is argued that there was no intimation given to the insurance company by respondent no.2 that the vehicle has been sold to respondent no.1, therefore, there is no liability of respondent no.3. The liability, if any, that should be of respondent no.2. 24The arguments advanced by learned counsel for both the sides are duly considered apart from perusing the record. Due to the accident, the claimant remained admitted in the hospital for a long period. In the accident, he suffered fracture both bones distal right leg, hemipherisis right side, head injury and other multiple injuries. The doctors on duty in Civil Hospital Mohali and GMCH Sector 32, Chandigarh attended the injured. The claimant is under treatment since the date of accident. As far as the loss of income due to hospitalization as a result of injuries is concerned, the 13 Sanjeev Sharma vs. Yadwinder Singh & Ors . claimant has alleged his income as Rs.25,000/- per month in the claim petition as well as in his affidavit. But there is no documentary evidence on the record to prove this fact and there is no other cogent evidence also to prove this fact. Hence, the income of the claimant is to be considered at Collector rate. The same is assessed to the tune of Rs.7000/- per month, though the Collector rate is on higher side, but it is not necessary that a person may get work daily. Keeping in view the entire facts & circumstances, the income of the claimant is assessed Rs.7000/- per month. 25As far as disability is concerned, as per PW-1 Dr. Ravi Kumar Preenja, the disability of the claimant is 75%. The claimant has alleged that it is to be taken as 100% as he is not in a position to work. In support of his arguments, the ld. Counsel relied upon the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case titled as Jakir Hussein vs. Sabir and Others 2015(2) RCR (Civil) 141 and Rajan vs. Soly Sebastian and another 2015 ACJ 2418. In this regard, this Tribunal is of the view that in those cases, the claimant was driver, but it is not so in the present matter. Keeping in view the facts & circumstances of the present case, the disability is assessed as 80%. The claimant is entitled for 30% increase in his income also by way of future prospects. Reliance in this regard can be placed upon the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as V . Mekala vs. M. Malathi and another 2014(2) RCR (Civil) 880 and Syed Sadiq etc. vs. United India Insurance Company I(2014) ACC 206 (SC). The ld. Counsel for claimant has pressed that the disability is functional. PW-1 Dr.Ravi Kumar Preenja has stated in his evidence that the patient would have problem in walking, climbing stairs and activities involving right hand, squatting, 14 Sanjeev Sharma vs. Yadwinder Singh & Ors . standing on affected leg. The ld. Counsel has stated that now the claimant has to work as labourer, therefore, disability is functional. Admittedly, the disability is functional for a person if he has to perform labour work. The income of the claimant has been assessed as Rs.7000/- per month. The annual income comes to the tune of Rs.84,000/-. The disability of the claimant has been assessed as 80% disability. 80% of the said amount comes to the tune of Rs.67200/-. The claimant is alleged to be 43 years old. Copy of voter card and Aadhar card of claimant are also placed on record in this regard as Ex P-4 & Ex P-5 in which his date of birth is reflected as 13.6.1972. In this way, he was 43 years old at the time of accident, therefore, the multiplier of 14 is to be applied in view of the law laid down by Hon’ble Supreme Court in Smt. Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Anr., 2009(3) RCR (Civil), 77. Therefore, due to disability, the loss of future income of claimant is assessed as Rs.67,200x14=Rs.9,40,800/-. As far as future prospects is concerned, the claimant has claimed the future prospectus @ 30%. He is entitled for the same in view of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in V . Mekala vs. M. Malathi and another 2014(2) RCR (Civil) 880 and Syed Sadiq etc. vs. United India Insurance Company I(2014) ACC 206 (SC) as he was 43 years old at the time of accident. Therefore, 30% future prospectus of the injured comes to the tune of Rs.2,82,240/-. 26The medical bills have been placed on record from Ex P-7 to Ex P-15 for the amount of Rs.16,268/-. The claimant is entitled for the same. Besides that, the claimant is also entitled for expenditure incurred on physiotherapy as per bills placed on record as Ex P-16 to Ex P-98 which 15 Sanjeev Sharma vs. Yadwinder Singh & Ors . comes to Rs.5040/-. The claimant has claimed the expenditure on attendant. The attendant Babbu has appeared as PW-3 and the original receipts are on the record from Ex P-99 to Ex P-112 which shows that the attendant has charged Rs.6000/- per month for 13 months. As such, the claimant is entitled to Rs.78,000/- as compensation for expenditure on attendant. The claimant is entitled for Rs.50,000/- for pain & suffering. He is also entitled for loss of amenities to the tune of Rs.50,000/-. Rs.20,000/- are assessed as transportation expenses. He is also entitled for Rs.25,000/- for hospitalization & healthy diet. In this way, the claimant is entitled for the following expenses:- Loss of future income = Rs.9,40,800/- Future prospectus (30%) = Rs.2,82,240/- Medical Expenses = Rs.16,268/- Physiotherapy expenses = Rs. 5040/- Attendant charges = Rs.78,000/- Pain & suffering = Rs.50,000/- Loss of amenities = Rs.50,000/- Transportation assessed = Rs.20,000/- Hospitalization & Healthy diet = Rs.25,000/- _____________ Total = Rs.14,67,348/- _____________ 27The total amount comes to the tune of Rs.14,67,348/- (Rs. Rs.14,68,000/- when taken in round figure). The claimant is entitled for the 16 Sanjeev Sharma vs. Yadwinder Singh & Ors . same. The claimant is entitled for interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the realization of the whole of this amount. 28 As far as liability is concerned, admittedly the offending vehicle has been sold by respondent no.2 to respondent no.1. Moreover, the vehicle was insured with respondent no.3. As such, the liability to make the payment is joint and several of the respondents no.1 and 3. However, the insurance company i.e. respondent no.3 is required to make the payment as vehicle in question was insured one vide insurance policy Ex R-4/ Ex R-2 and respondent no.3 is bound to indemnify the respondent no.1, the owner of the vehicle in question. 29 In view of above discussion, issue no. 2 is decided in favour of claimant accordingly. ISSUE NO. 3: 30This issue was not specifically pressed at the time of arguments. However, otherwise also there is nothing on record to prove this issue and the copy of driving license of respondent no.1 has been placed on record as Ex. R-1. Therefore, this issue is decided against the respondent no.3. RELIEF: 31 In view of above discussion, it is held that the claimant is entitled 17 Sanjeev Sharma vs. Yadwinder Singh & Ors . for compensation and an award of Rs.14,68,000/- (Rs.Fourteen lacs Sixty Eight thousand only) is hereby passed in favour of claimant and against the respondents no.1 & 3 jointly and severally along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the realization of the whole of this amount.

Claim Petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act. ***** Present: Sh. Yogesh Gupta, counsel for claimant. Sh. Sandeep Yadav, counsel for respondents no.1 & 2. Sh. Simrandeep Singh, counsel for respondent no.3. A W A R D The claimant has filed the present claim petition under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act for seeking compensation to the tune of 2 Zile Singh vs Sanjay Pandey & Ors. Rs.20,00,000/- on account of injuries suffered by him in a road side vehicular accident. 2 While providing the particulars as required under the Motor Vehicles Act and the Rules framed thereunder the claimant inter-alia alleged that on 3.2.2015, the claimant was going from his office to his residence by driving a Scooter at slow speed and on left side of the road. When he reached Saheb Singh Light Point, Sector 17, Chandigarh, an Innova Car bearing registration no. DL1YC-2176 came at fast speed and without blowing the horn struck against the scooter of the claimant. The said car was being driven at fast speed and in rash & negligent manner by respondent no.1 Sanjay Pandey. Due to the hit, the claimant sustained serious injuries and he was taken to GMSH Sector 16, Chandigarh. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. The claimant was not at all at fault. A criminal case was registered against respondent no.1 for causing the accident. 3The claimant was 44 years old at the time of accident, working in government department i.e. Food & Supply Department, Haryana, 30 Bays Building, Sector 17, Chandigarh and was drawing monthly salary of Rs.35,000/-. FIR no.46 dated 6.2.2015 was registered in Police Station Sector 17, Chandigarh. In the accident, the claimant suffered fracture in left shoulder/forearm region and other multiple injuries. The doctors on duty in GMSH Sector 16, Chandigarh attended the claimant. The claimant is under treatment since the date of accident and had spent about Rs.One lac so far on his medical treatment. Rs.20 lacs has been claimed as compensation for loss 3 Zile Singh vs Sanjay Pandey & Ors. suffered due to permanent disability, loss of earning, loss of expenditure on treatment, medicine, conveyance, special diet, loss of social status, mental agony, pain & suffering, expenditure on attendant, loss of enjoyment of future life etc. 4In response of the notice, the respondents appeared and contested the petition. Respondents no.1 & 2 filed written statement taking preliminary objections regarding concealment of material facts and alleged that the present petition is a projected story only to extract money from the respondents. 5While replying on merits, it is submitted that respondent no.1 was not negligent in driving. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the claimant himself who was driving his vehicle without obeying the traffic rules and caused the accident with the vehicle of respondent no.1. The police lodged a false FIR against respondent no.1. The respondent no.1 is having a valid driving license and respondent no.2 is having valid RC and insurance cover note of the vehicle in question. The vehicle is duly insured with respondent no.3. An exaggerated amount has been claimed by the claimant as compensation. The respondent no.1 has not caused any accident. False and fabricated story had been made. The claimant is not entitled for any compensation from the answering respondents, as alleged. Therefore, the claim petition may be dismissed with heavy costs. 5Respondent no.3, Future Generalli Insurance Company Ltd appeared and filed written statement taking preliminary objections regarding 4 Zile Singh vs Sanjay Pandey & Ors. maintainability. It is submitted that the driver respondent no.1 of Innova no.DL1YC-2176 was not having a valid driving license at the time of alleged accident. Even if it is proved that the driver was having license, the same was not valid & effective driving license to drive the vehicle in question at the time of alleged accident, rather it was fake and the vehicle was driven in violation of terms & conditions of insurance policy. Thus, the insurance company is not liable to indemnify the owner qua the alleged accident. The said vehicle was being used without being properly registered and it was being used in violation of authorization as to use, thereby respondent no.1 has committed gross deliberate breach of terms & conditions of insurance policy, hence the answering respondent cannot be held liable. The claimant has got no cause of action and locus standi to file the present petition against the answering respondent. The petition has been filed by the claimant in connivance and collusion with respondents no.1 & 2 just to claim illegal compensation. The answering respondent reserves its right to take all defenses and pleas available to respondents no.1 & 2 under Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. If the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the compensation is to be paid to the claimant, then the rate of interest on the amount of award cannot be more than 6% p.a. The Motor Vehicle Act or Rules does not specify the rate of interest. 6While replying on merits, it is submitted that there is delay of 3 days in lodging the FIR. No alleged accident took place on 3.2.2015. It is denied that the alleged accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. Therefore, the claim petition be dismissed with cost against the answering respondent, in the interest of justice. 5 Zile Singh vs Sanjay Pandey & Ors. 7From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed vide order dated 16.3.2016:- 1 Whether the accident dated 3.2.2015 resulting in injuries to claimant occurred on account of rash and negligent driving of vehicle no.DL-1YC-2176 by respondent no.1? OPP. 2 Whether the claimant is entitled to compensation for injuries suffered by him, if so, to what extent and from whom? OPP. 3 Whether the driver of offending vehicle was not holding a valid & effective driving license on the date of accident and the vehicle was being driven in violation of the terms and conditions of the insurance policy? OPR3. 4 Relief. 8To substantiate their respective claims the parties led their evidence. 9The claimant has examined as many as three witnesses in all. The claimant himself stepped into the witness box as PW-1. Bhupinder Singh, Auditor o/o Director Food & Supply, Haryana, Chandigarh was examined as PW-2. Dr. Kapish Gupta, MO, Deptt. of Orthopedics, GMSH Sector 16, Chandigarh was examined as PW-3. Documents Ex P-1 to Ex P- 9 were tendered in evidence. Thereafter, the evidence of the claimant was closed. 10On the other hand, the the documents Ex R-1 to Ex R-6 were tendered in evidence by the respondents and thereafter the evidence of the respondents was closed. 6 Zile Singh vs Sanjay Pandey & Ors. 11No rebuttal evidence was adduced by the claimant. 12The learned counsels for both the parties were heard. The issue wise findings with reasons thereof are as follows : ISSUE No. 1: 13To substantiate this issue, the ld. counsel for the claimant argued that to prove the accident, the claimant Zile Singh himself has appeared as PW-1 and deposed that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. He deposed about the injuries suffered by him and about his treatment from GMSH Sector 16, Chandigarh. A criminal case has been registered against respondent no.1 for causing the accident on the basis of statement of claimant. Therefore, from the statement of claimant corroborated with the fact that the FIR Ex P-1 was registered against the respondent no.1 and the copies of medical record Ex P-2 & Ex P- 3, the rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1, the accident and the injuries sustained by the claimant in the accident are well proved. 14The learned counsels for the respondents no.1 & 2, on the other hand, opposed the arguments of learned counsel for the complainant. The learned counsel argued that the accident and rash & negligent driving of respondent no.1 is not proved from the statement of PW-1 as he is interested witness. There is no other evidence on the record to prove the accident and rash & negligent driving. The ld. counsel for respondent no.3 argued on 7 Zile Singh vs Sanjay Pandey & Ors. same lines and further stated that the FIR is not sufficient to prove the accident and rash & negligent driving. Therefore, the alleged accident and rash & negligent driving of respondent no.1 are not proved. 15The arguments advanced by learned counsel for both the sides are duly considered apart from perusing the record. The claimant Zile Singh while appearing as PW-1 has well deposed that on 3.2.2015, the claimant was going from his office to his residence by driving a Scooter at slow speed and on left side of the road. When he reached Saheb Singh Light Point, Sector 17, Chandigarh, an Innova Car bearing registration no. DL1YC-2176 came at fast speed and without blowing the horn and struck against the scooter of the claimant. The said car was being driven at fast speed and in rash & negligent manner by respondent no.1 Sanjay Pandey. Due to the hit, the claimant sustained serious injuries and he was taken to GMSH Sector 16, Chandigarh. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. The claimant was not at all at fault. A criminal case was registered against respondent no.1 for causing the accident. He proved on record the copies of medical record as Ex P-2 & Ex P-3. The testimony of PW-1 is corroborated by the copy of FIR Ex P-1. From the statement of PW- 1 corroborated with the fact of recording of FIR and the facing of trial by the respondent no.1, the accident, the rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and the injuries sustained by the claimant in the accident are well established. The statement of PW-1 cannot be discarded merely on the ground that PW-1 is interested witness. This witness has given a natural version and his confidence could not be shaken during his cross- examination. If the statement of the witnesses is found trustworthy, then it 8 Zile Singh vs Sanjay Pandey & Ors. can be relied upon and cannot be discarded merely on the ground that witness was an interested witness. Apart from that the accident and rash and negligent driving is to be proved beyond reasonable doubt in criminal trial only. In the civil matters, like claim petitions, the accident and rash and negligent can be proved with the help of preponderance of probabilities also. Reliance in this regard can be given of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in case titled as Kusum Lata and others Vs. Satbir and others, 2011(4) LJR 512. In such circumstances, the rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and the injuries sustained by claimant in accident are well proved. 16 In view of above discussion, issue No. 1 is decided in favour of claimant. ISSUE NO. 2 : 17To substantiate this issue, the learned counsel for the claimant argued that the claimant was treated for the injuries sustained by him in the accident and he remained admitted in the hospital. He suffered fracture in his left shoulder in the forearm region and other multiple injuries. PW-3 Dr. Kapish Gupta deposed that permanent physical disability of claimant is 6% and this is a functional disability and it will affect on day-to-day working of claimant. The injured may need some special diet & physiotherapy. In this way, the disability can be said functional disability and multiplier method is required to be used to find out the loss of earning. The claimant was working in Food & Supply Department, Haryana and was earning about Rs.35,000/- 9 Zile Singh vs Sanjay Pandey & Ors. per month. He is entitled for 6% loss of earning by using multiplier method. He is entitled for compensation for medical bills, disability, loss of amenities, loss of income, pain & suffering and hospitalization & healthy diet. The compensation may be assessed accordingly. 18The learned counsel for the respondents, on the other hand, opposed the arguments of the learned counsel for the claimant. The learned counsel argued that by way of evidence, the expenses are not proved. The ld. counsel for respondent no.3 argued on same lines and further stated that it is wrong to say that the claimant has suffered any functional disability. In fact the claimant is competent to work as he could work before the accident, therefore, there is no loss of income to the claimant. Further, keeping in view the nature of his job, the claimant is not entitled to any claim for functional disability. He is not entitled for loss of salary also as the salary of entire period was paid to him. Hence, he is not entitled for any claim. 19The learned counsel for claimant rebutted the arguments as regard to loss of salary for the period of leave. It is argued that if there was no accident, then leave could be used by him for other purpose, therefore, he is entitled for loss of salary due to leave. In support of his contention, the ld. counsel relied upon the law laid down by Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in the case titled as Randhir vs. Raja and ors. FAO no.5033 of 2009 (O&M) decided on 8.2.2012. 20The arguments advanced by learned counsel for both the sides are duly considered apart from perusing the record. The claimant is alleged 10 Zile Singh vs Sanjay Pandey & Ors. to be working as Auditor in Food & Supply Department, Haryana. PW-2 Bhupinder Singh has deposed that the claimant has drawn gross pay of Rs.29,203/- for the month of January, 2015 and proved copy of salary slip as Ex P-7. Hence his income is to be taken at the rate of Rs.29,203/- per month and after deducting income tax, the actual income of the claimant comes to Rs.26,703/-. The annual income of the claimant comes to Rs.3,22,836/-. As per disability certificate Ex PX, the claimant has suffered 6% disability. The functional disability is different from ordinary disability. The claimant has to perform office work only and no labour work. Therefore, his functional disability is to be assessed as 5%. While taking the disability @ 5% of the said amount comes to the tune of Rs.16,141-80. The claimant is alleged to be 44 years old, therefore, the multiplier of 14 is to be applied in view of the law laid down by Hon’ble Supreme Court in Smt. Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Anr., 2009(3) RCR (Civil), 77. Therefore, due to disability, the loss of future income of claimant is assessed as Rs.16,141.80x14=Rs.2,25,985/-. The claimant is also entitled to compensation of Rs.12,000/- for 6% disability. The claimant remained on medical leave for 44 days w.e.f. 4.2.2015 to 19.3.2015 vide order Ex P-8 and he is entitled to loss of income for this period on the ground that had there been no accident, he could used the leave for his other personal purpose. Reliance in this regard can be placed upon the law laid down by Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in the case titled as Randhir vs. Raja and ors. FAO no.5033 of 2009 (O&M) decided on 8.2.2012. As such, he is entitled to Rs.40000/- as compensation on account of loss of income. The claimant is entitled for Rs.20,000/- for pain & suffering. He is entitled for Rs.20,000/- for hospitalization & healthy diet. 11 Zile Singh vs Sanjay Pandey & Ors. The claimant is also entitled to Rs.5,000/- as transportation expenses. The claimant has claimed the expenditure on attendant which are assessed at Rs.9,000/-. In this way, the claimant is entitled for the following expenses:- Functional Disability = Rs.2,25,985/- Disability = Rs.12,000/- Loss of salary = Rs.40,000/- Hospitalization & healthy diet = Rs.20,000/- Attendant charges = Rs.9,000/- Pain & suffering = Rs.20,000/- Transportation expenses = Rs.5,000/- assessed ________________________ Total= Rs. 3,31,985/- ________________________ 21The total amount comes to the tune of Rs.3,31,985/- (Rs.3,32,000/- when taken in round figure). The claimant is entitled for the same. The claimant is entitled for interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the realization of the whole of this amount. 22 The liability to make the payment is joint and several of all the respondents. However, the insurance company i.e. respondent no.3 is required to make the payment as vehicle in question was insured one vide insurance policy Ex R-6 and respondent no.3 is bound to indemnify the respondent no.1, registered owner of the vehicle in question. 12 Zile Singh vs Sanjay Pandey & Ors. 23 In view of above discussion, issue no. 2 is decided in favour of claimant. ISSUE NO. 3: 24This issue was not specifically pressed at the time of arguments. However, otherwise also there is nothing on record to prove this issue and the copy of driving license of respondent no.2 has been placed on record as Ex. R-1. Therefore, this issue is decided against the respondent no.3. RELIEF: 25 In view of above discussion, it is held that the claimants are entitled for compensation and an award of Rs.3,32,000/- (Rs.Three Lacs Thirty Two thousand only) is hereby passed in favour of claimant and against the respondents no.1 to 3 along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the realization of the whole of this amount. However, the insurance company is required to make the payment as vehicle in question was insured one. 28The half amount of compensation of claimant shall be deposited in the bank account of the claimant on submitting copy of pass book. The half amount of compensation of claimant shall be deposited in the form of FDR in his names in any nationalized bank of his choice for a period of one year. Petition is accepted accordingly.

A W A R D The claimants have filed the present claim petition under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act for seeking compensation to the tune of Rs.1,25,00,000/- on account of death of Shobhit Tyagi in a road side vehicular accident. 2 While providing the particulars as required under the Motor Vehicles Act and the Rules framed thereunder the claimant inter-alia alleged that on 6.2.2015, the deceased Shobhit Tyagi was going on the road leading from Derabassi to Chandigarh while sitting in a three wheeler which was being driven by Amit Kumar at slow speed and on left side of the road. When they were on the flyover of Zirakpur at about 2 p.m., at that time a car bearing registration no. HP-03-D-2358 came at fast speed from the side of Chandigarh. While it was in the process of overtaking a Pajero Car no.CH- 04-E-0067 driven by Mankirat Singh, it struck against the said Pajero. Due to hit, the said Pajero went out of control and it struck against an electric pole and then jumped the divider and struck against a car and thereafter it struck against a motorcycle and then struck against the three wheeler of the 3 Pratima Tyagi & Ors. vs. Samarpreet Singh & Ors . deceased. Thereafter, it stopped after hitting the wall of the flyover. The said car no.HP-03-D-2358 was being driven at fast speed and in a rash and negligent manner by Samarpreet Singh respondent no.1. As a result of this accident, the deceased Shobit Tyagi and other received serious injuries. The deceased was taken to Civil Hospital Derabassi from where he was referred to PGI Chandigarh from where he was taken to Apollo Hospital, New Delhi from there he was taken to VMMC & Safdarjang Hospital, New Delhi where he died on 12.2.2015 due to the injuries he received in the accident. The post mortem of the deceased was conducted in the VMMC & Safdarjang Hospital, New Delhi. Bhupinder, Amit Kumar and Mankirat Singh, driver of Pajero Car no.CH-04-E-0067 also died in this accident. The accident took place due to composite negligence of car bearing registration no.HP-03-D-2358 driven by Samarpreet Singh and Pajero bearing no.CH- 04-E-0067 driven by Mankirat Singh (now deceased), therefore, the claimants are entitled to recover the entire amount from the impleaded respondents as they are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the claimants. The deceased and others were not at all at fault. 3The deceased was 25 years of age at the time of accident, working as Marketing Executive in S.A.S. Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi and was earning Rs.40,000/- per month including incentives. FIR no.26 dated 6.2.2014 u/s 279/304-A/427 of IPC was registered in Police Station Zirakpur, Distt. SAS Nagar. The deceased was attended by doctors on duty in Civil Hospital Derabassi, PGI Chandigarh, Apollo Hospital, New Delhi and VMMC & Safdarjang Hospital, New Delhi. A sum of Rs.1 lac was spent on medical expenses, funeral expenses and performing the last rites of the deceased. Claimant no.1 is the wife of deceased, claimant no.2 is the minor daughter 4 Pratima Tyagi & Ors. vs. Samarpreet Singh & Ors . of deceased and claimant no.3 is the mother of the deceased. The claimants had suf - fered huge loss due to untimely death of the deceased, therefore, they need immedi - ate financial help. Rs.1 crore Rs.25 lacs has been claimed for untimely death of deceased, loss of love & affection to the claimants, future prospects, medical expenses and funeral expenses etc. 4In response of the notice, the respondents appeared and contested the petition. Respondents no.1 and 2 filed written statement stating therein that respondent no.1 is a minor whose date of birth is 19.9.1998, so he is represented by his father respondent no.2. On 6.2.2015 at 1.15 p.m., as per routine, Sukhwinder Singh respondent no.2 went to Guru Nanak Public School Sector 36, Chandigarh to fetch his son and after taking his son from t he school left for Zirakpur by his car no. HP-03-D-2358 driven by him. About 1.45 p.m approximately when he reached on flyover bridge at Zirakpur, suddenly a car make Pajero came from behind with great speed driven rashly and negligently and hit car no. HP-03-D-2358 from front left side and struck against the electric poll. The car was in such speed that after striking the poll crossed the road divider and came on wrong side. The same way the car driven by respondent no.2 also went out of control, its tyre was burst and the car crossed the road divider and dashed against the railing wall from other side. An auto rickshaw was coming at his own side dashed against the car with the auto rickshaw hit the left side of the car and damaged the car which resulted that car door was locked. The respondent no.1 was seating on the front seat near the driver seat, so re - spondent no.2 driver of the vehicle came out, thereafter respondent no.1 also came out from the driver's seat side. Many people gathered who stated that it was the fault of Pajero car, the recording of the accident was videographed on mobile phone. The statement of the eye witness was recorded on mobile phone, the same would be pro - 5 Pratima Tyagi & Ors. vs. Samarpreet Singh & Ors . duced at the time of evidence. The respondent no.1 was taken to Max Hospital, Mo - hali where respondent no.1 was admitted and was discharged from the hospital after 3 days. Respondents no.1 and 2 are not liable for any consequences. Therefore, the claim petition may be dismissed in the interest of justice. 5Respondent no.3 filed written statement stating therein that since no age proof has been submitted, it is denied that the deceased was 25 years of age at the relevant time. It is denied that he was occupied with any work or was having any income from any source. The claimants are under obligation to state which evidence is required to be led prior to commencement of the trial and they cannot be allowed to produce any evidence at any time at their own wish. No accident as alleged ever took place. FIR if any has been got registered with wrong facts. It is specifically denied that any amount was spent on medical expenses, funeral or last rites of the deceased. No accident took place with car no. HP-03-D-2358. Neither respondent no.1 is the driver nor respondent no.2 is registered owner of the car no. HP-03-D- 2358. Moreover, the driver, owner and insurer of three wheeler no. PB-65-X-1602 as well as that of all other vehicles allegedly involved in the accident have not been impleaded in the array of parties. As such, the present petition is not maintainable for non-joinder of necessary parties and mis-joinder of parties. It is submitted that car bearing registration no. HP-03-D-2358 was insured by the answering respondent vide policy no.42040/31/14/6700009382 effective from 7.11.2014 to 6.11.2015 in the name of Sukhwinder Singh s/o Rewal Singh r/o B-2, VIP Road, Zirakpur subject to the terms and conditions, limitations and exclusions contained therein. The claimants are neither legal heirs/representatives nor dependent upon the deceased in any manner and are therefore not entitled to any amount of compensation. The amount claimed by the claimants is excessive and highly exaggerated. The claimants are not 6 Pratima Tyagi & Ors. vs. Samarpreet Singh & Ors . entitled for receiving any amount of compensation from the answering respondent. They must prove each and every head along with documentary evidence under which any amount of compensation becomes payable to them. It is submitted that it is denied that any accident had taken place with car no. HP-03-D-2358. In case it is held by the court that the accident had taken place with the said car, then also it is denied that the same was being driven rashly and negligently by its driver, whereas the accident if any had taken place due to fault drivers of the three wheeler, Pajero no. CH-04-E-0067 and other vehicles allegedly involved in the accident who were driving the same in a rash and negligent manner and without a valid driving license. All other averments are denied being wrong as well as for want of proof. The replying respondents cannot be held liable to pay any compensation. 6While taking additional pleas, it is submitted that the replying respondent cannot be held liable to pay any amount of compensation to the claimants in view of contravention of express terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if any, as the owner of vehicle allegedly involved in accident deliberately drove the same who was not having a driving license and in case any such driving license is produced by him, then also the same was neither valid, authorising to drive the said class of vehicle nor effective at the relevant time. All the defenses u/s 147, 149, 157, 158(6) & 170 of the Motor Vehicle Act are taken up which are either open to the answering respondent or to the co-respondents. The answering respondent reserves its right to file a fresh and amended written statement, if at any stage some new fact or information is placed on record or is brought to the notice of this court which has already not been stated by the claimants in the claim petition or by the co-respondents in the course of proceedings. The claimants 7 Pratima Tyagi & Ors. vs. Samarpreet Singh & Ors . are bound to disclose to this court that they have not filed any similar appli - cation in any other court of law in respect of the alleged accident. The claimants have got no cause of action/locus standi to file the present petition against the answering respondent. The present claim petition has been filed by the claimants in collusion with respondents no.1 and 2 and by concealing and distorting the material facts i.e. the factual position as such the claim petition is liable to be dismissed on this score. 7 The car no. HP-03-D-2358 allegedly insured by the answering respondent, allegedly involved in the accident, was being used in contraven - tion of the terms and conditions of policy, if any. The same was being used when neither it was properly registered nor was having certificate of fitness and it was being used in violation of the authorisation as to use thereby the respondents no.1 & 2 have committed gross deliberate breach of terms & conditions of insurance policy, if any hence the answering respondent cannot be held liable. The present petition is not maintainable for want of jurisdic - tion of this court. Therefore, the claim petition qua the answering respondent may be dismissed with costs. 8Respondents no.4 and 6 filed written statement stating therein that the i-20 car no. HP-03-D-2358 was coming from Chandigarh on very high speed an being driven in rash & negligent manner by respondent no.1 and hit his car on the back of Pajero car of the answering respondent due to which Pajero car became out of control and struck against the electric pole and jumped the divider and struck against the car, motorcycle and thereafter 8 Pratima Tyagi & Ors. vs. Samarpreet Singh & Ors . in the three wheeler and it stopped after hitting the wall of the flyover. The Pajero car no.CH-01-E-0067 was insured with Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd., branch office SCO no.145-146, 2nd floor, Sector 9-C, Madhya Marg, Chandigarh. The accident in question was caused due to rash and negligent driving of i-20 car no. HP-03-D-2358 by its driver i.e. respondent no.1 who hit its front at the back of Pajero car and due to that the driver of Pajero lost its control and in this way, the answering respondent was not at fault in causing the accident. It is submitted that it is admitted to the extent that the accident had taken place, but it is submitted that i-20 car no.HP-03- D-2358 was coming from the side of Chandigarh in a very high speed and driven in rash and negligent manner by its driver i.e. respondent no.1 namely Samarpreet Singh. In process of overtaking the Pajero car no. CH-04-E- 0067 struck/hit his car in the back side of Pajero and due to which the Pajero car became out of control and struck against the electric pole and jumped the driver and struck against the car, motorcycle and thereafter in the three wheeler and it stopped after hitting the wall of the flyover. In this way, the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of i-20 car no. HP-03- D-2358 by its driver. Therefore, answering respondents no.4 and 6 are not liable to compensate the claimants. But even if this court come to the conclusion that the answering respondents are liable, then the insurer of Pajero car no.CH-04-E-0067 i.e. Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd vide policy certificate no. 200454231012374 valid from 23.5.2014 to 22.5.2015 is liable to pay the compensation as the Pajero car was insured at the time of accident. Therefore, the claim petition may be dismissed qua respondents no.4 and 6 or in the alternative may be decided on the basis of submissions made above, in the interest of justice. 9 Pratima Tyagi & Ors. vs. Samarpreet Singh & Ors . 9Respondent no.5 filed written statement taking preliminary objections that the answering respondent has been wrongly impleaded as respondent as the vehicle no.CH-04-E-0067 was not insured with the answering respondent insurance company on the date of accident i.e. on 28.5.12. The answering respondent is thus not liable to indemnify the owner under any circumstances as no contract exists between the answering respondent and the owner of the vehicle i.e. the claimant in as far as third party liability qua the vehicle no.CH-04-E-0067 is concerned. The driver of the vehicle in question was not holding a valid and proper driving license. In the absence of driving license, the vehicle was being driven in violation of terms & conditions of the insurance policy and thus the insurance company is not liable to indemnify the owner. The claimant has not given any intimation about the policy particulars and the driving license, so he has violated the terms & conditions of the policy and the insurance company is not liable to indemnify the owner respondent no.1 qua the accident. 10The driver was driving the vehicle in violation of the terms & conditions of the policy. The claimant has no locus-standi to file the present petition. The present petition has been filed by the claimant in connivance and collusion with respondent no.1 and 4 in order to extract compensation. In fact, the vehicle no.CH-04-E-0067 was not involved in the accident at all. The answering respondent takes the specific pleas u/s 147, 149(2), 157 and 170 of the Motor Vehicle Act and in terms of the policy of insurance and so the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. The claimants are self reliant and were not dependent on the income of the deceased, as such the present petition deserves to be dismissed. 10 Pratima Tyagi & Ors. vs. Samarpreet Singh & Ors . 11While replying on merits, it is submitted that no accident as stated ever took place with the vehicle no.CH-04-E-0067. Moreover, the respondent did not give any intimation to the respondent-insurance company regarding the accident. The claimant has wrongly mentioned the name of insurance company as respondent. However, the policy particulars vide which the vehicle was insured with respondent company have not been given and in the absence of the same, the answering respondent has been wrongly impleaded as a respondent and is not liable to indemnify the owner even if the claim petition is allowed by this Tribunal. Further the policy is subject to 64 VB confirmations. It is denied that the petitioner is entitled to any compensation or the answering respondent is liable to pay any compensation to the petitioners. The averments as made involving the vehicle no.CH-04-E-0067 in the accident are totally wrong and in fact the said vehicle has been mentioned just to extract the money from the answering respondent insurance company. Neither the vehicle bearing no.CH-04-E-0067 was involved in the accident nor the same was insured with the answering respondent. Still further even if the claimant produced the insurance policy at a later stage, the vehicle was being driven in violation of the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and the insurance company is thus not liable to pay any compensation. The respondent does not admit that the applicants are the legal heirs/dependents of the deceased. The applicants have to strictly prove that they are the legal representatives of the deceased and are entitled to maintain the present application against these respondents. Hence, the present application is not at all maintainable and is liable to be dismissed. 11 Pratima Tyagi & Ors. vs. Samarpreet Singh & Ors . 12Without prejudice to the submissions stated above and without admitting any liability, it is further submitted that if it is found that the petitioner is entitled for any compensation, in that event the aspect of contributory negligence on the part of driver/owner of the other vehicles involved in this accident be considered and the award if any passed be apportioned accordingly in equal proportion amongst them. Therefore, the claim petition may be dismissed with costs. 13From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed:- 1 Whether accident dated 6.2.2015 resulting in death of Shobhit Tyagi occurred on account of composite rash and negligent driving of vehicles no.HP-03-D-2358 and CH-04-E- 0067? OPP. 2 Whether the claimants are entitled to compensation on account of death of Shobhit Tyagi, if so, to what extent and from whom? OPP. 3 Whether the drivers of offending vehicles were not holding a valid & effective driving license on the date of accident and the vehicle was being driven in violation of terms and conditions of the insurance policy? OPR3. 4 Relief. 14To substantiate their respective claims the parties led their evidence. 15The claimants have examined as many as four witnesses in all. The claimant no.1 Pratima Tyagi herself stepped into the witness box as PW1. Neeraj Sharma, Director, Sai Ad Solutions (P) Ltd., Regd. Office at 12 Pratima Tyagi & Ors. vs. Samarpreet Singh & Ors . C-27, First Floor, Pili Kothi, MB Road, Khanpur, New Delhi was examined as PW-2. Bijan Thapa, who was eye witness was examined as PW-3. ASI Harjeet Singh, posted at Police Station Zirakpur was examined as PW-4. Documents Ex P-1 to Ex P-24, Ex PX & Ex PY were tendered in evidence. Thereafter, the evidence of the claimants was closed. 16On the other hand, respondent no.2 Sukhwinder Singh himself appeared as RW-1. Surjit Singh s/o Daya Singh was examined as RW-2. Documents Ex R-1 to Ex R-10, Ex RX & Ex RY were tendered in evidence and thereafter evidence of respondents was closed. 17No rebuttal evidence was adduced by the claimants. 18The learned counsels for both the parties were heard. The issue wise findings with reasons thereof are as follows : ISSUE No. 1: 19To substantiate this issue, the learned counsel for the claimants argued that from the evidence oral as well as documentary adduced by the claimants, the accident by way of rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and deceased Mankirat and the death of deceased Shobhit Tyagi are well proved. PW-3 Bijan Thapa who was eye witness has well proved the rash & negligent driving of respondent no.1 and deceased Mankirat Singh. The FIR Ex P-20 was also registered against respondent no.1 and he is facing trial for rash & negligent driving. Therefore, the composite rash & 13 Pratima Tyagi & Ors. vs. Samarpreet Singh & Ors . negligent driving of respondent no.1 and deceased Mankirat Singh is well proved. Shobhit Tyagi who was travelling in the three-wheeler was killed in the said accident. His death is well proved from the statement of PW-1 Pratima Tyagi his wife, PW-3 Bijan Thapa. The death certificate is on the record as Ex P-6. The post mortem report is on the record as Ex P-4. The statement of the above witnesses corroborated by these documents well proves that Shobhit Tyagi has died in the accident caused due to composite rash & negligent driving of respondent no.1 and deceased Mankirat Singh. 20The learned counsel for respondents no.1 & 2, on the other hand, opposed the arguments. The ld. counsel for respondent no.1 argued that from the evidence adduced by the claimants, the rash & negligent driving of respondent no.1 or composite rash & negligent driving of respondent no.1 is not proved. Apart from that, respondent no.1 was not driving the car having no HP-03-D-2358 on the day of incident, rather respondent no.2 was driving the car. Respondent no.2 has well appeared in the witness box as RW-1 and deposed that the accident was not caused due to his rash & negligent driving. It is alleged that in fact, the accident was caused due to rash & negligent driving of the driver of the vehicle Pajero which hit his car i.e. Pajero from front side and went on wrong side of the road. That Pajero car crossed the divider of the road. An auto rickshaw which was coming at his own side dashed against the car. In this way, he was not at fault, rather the driver of Pajero car was at fault. 21The learned counsel for respondent no.3 argued on the same lines and stated that the accident and rash & negligent driving of respondent 14 Pratima Tyagi & Ors. vs. Samarpreet Singh & Ors . no.1 is not proved. The ld. counsel further argued that if rash & negligent driving of respondent no.1 is proved, in that eventuality, respondent no.3 is not liable to make the payment as respondent no.1 was having no valid driving license at the time of accident. 22The learned counsel for respondents no.4 & 6 argued that the accident has not taken place due to rash & negligent driving of driver of Pajero car no. CH-04-E-0067. This is well proved by RW-2 Surjit Singh who was eye witness and sitting in the vehicle with Mankirat Singh. He has deposed that the accident has taken place due to rash & negligent driving of driver of car make i-20 having registration no. HP-03-D-2358. The driver of the said car in process of overtaking Pajero hit the same. Dut to hit, Pajero went out of control and struck against the electric pole and jumped the divider and struck against one car, one motorcycle and thereafter struck against three-wheeler coming from opposite side. In this way, the deceased Mankirat Singh, the driver of Pajero was not rash and negligent and respondents no.4 & 6 are not liable in any manner. 23The learned counsel for respondent no.5 argued on the same lines. He further stated that the respondent no.4 was not having any valid driving license at the time of accident. A learning driving license has been produced, but the terms & conditions of learning driving license were not abide by respondent no.4. The word 'L' was not written on the car. Moreover, no major person having driving license was sitting with him. As such, if the accident is proved due to rash & negligent driving of respondent no.4 or composite rash and negligent driving of respondent no.4, then 15 Pratima Tyagi & Ors. vs. Samarpreet Singh & Ors . respondent no.5 is not liable to pay compensation in any manner. 24The arguments advanced by the learned counsels for both the sides are duly considered apart from perusing the record. In the present matter, from the pleadings of the parties and from the evidence adduced by the parties, it is well made out that the accident has taken place and Shobhit Tyagi has died in the accident. The FIR Ex P-20 was initially registered against Sukhwinder Singh, but during investigation, it came out that the car was being driven by respondent no.1 Samarpreet Singh and he was arrested in the matter. PW-4 ASI Harjit Singh stated that he recorded supplementary statement of Mani Saxena in this regard. PW-3 Bijan Thapa who was eye witness has well proved the rash & negligent driving of respondent no.1 and deceased Mankirat Singh. In view of FIR Ex P-20 respondent no.1 is facing trial for rash & negligent driving. Therefore, the composite rash & negligent driving of respondent no.1 and deceased Mankirat Singh is well proved. Shobhit Tyagi who was travelling in the three-wheeler was killed in the said accident. His death is well proved from the statement of PW-1 Pratima Tyagi his wife and PW-3 Bijan Thapa. The death certificate is on the record as Ex P-6. The post mortem report is on the record as Ex P-4. The statement of the above witnesses corroborated by these documents well proves that Shobhit Tyagi has died in the accident caused due to composite rash & negligent driving of respondent no.1 and deceased Mankirat Singh. 25As far as contention of RW-1 and RW-2 is concerned that they were present in the vehicle at the time of accident is concerned, that cannot be relied upon because it was a serious accident and they have not sustained even minor injury. As such, it cannot be said that they were present on the spot and their statements cannot 16 Pratima Tyagi & Ors. vs. Samarpreet Singh & Ors . be relied upon. 26As far as the fact of driving license is concerned, respondent no.1 was not having any driving license being minor. However, the driving license of deceased Mankirat has been placed on record. Now, the contention of the insurance company is that this driving license cannot be relied upon as its terms & conditions were not fulfilled as the word 'L' was not written on the vehicle and no major person was accompanying the minor driver. In this regard, this Tribunal is of the view that insurance company shall not be absolved of its liability merely because the driver of offending motor vehicle at the time of accident hold a learner license and that the word 'L' is not written on the vehicle and that the driver is not accompanied by a major person. The learner driving license is covered by the expression 'duly licensed'. Reliance in this regard can be given by the law laid down by Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in case titled as Gurmukh Singh and anr. Vs Ajmer Kaur and ors. 1986 ACJ 386 and the law laid down by Hon'ble Kerala High Court in case titled as Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Baby and ors. 2015(4) RCR (Civil) 430 . It was held by Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in case titled as Virender Singh and anr. vs. M/s IFFCO Tokio General Insurance Company Ltd and another FAO no.1242 of 2014 (O&M) decided on 14.1.2016 that:- “Rule 3 requires a person to be accompanied by an instructor and if it is breached, it may have other consequences if the rules provided for the same, but, they will have nothing to do with exonerating the liability of insurance unless the contractual terms of insurance policy provided for exclusion. Form 3 in the Central Motor Vehicle Rules, 1989 itself contains no more than a warning drawing attention to Rule 17 Pratima Tyagi & Ors. vs. Samarpreet Singh & Ors . 3. This is so because the lines of defences for the insurer cannot traverse beyond the boundaries set under section 149 of the Motor Vehicles Act. The said provisions only allows for a condition that could exclude the driving by a person who has not duly licenced. A person who held learners licence must be taken as “duly licenced” as interpreted by the Supreme Court in Swaran Singh's case (supra) and confirmed in subsequent rulings of the Supreme Court which I have cited above. There is no scope for importing requirement of instructor's presence for adjudging the entitlement of the insured to secure indemnity ”. 27Keeping in view the above facts & circumstances, it is well established that the accident has taken place due to composite negligence. Hence, the composite negligence of the driver of the Car no.HP-03-D-2358 i.e. respondent no.1 and that of the deceased Mankirat Singh is assessed as 50% each. 28In view of the above discussion, this issue is accordingly decided in favour of the claimants. ISSUE No:2: 29The learned counsel for the claimants argued that the deceased was 25 years old and was working as Marketing Executive in S.A.S. Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi (Sai Ad Solutions (P) Ltd and drawing monthly salary of Rs.40,000/-. The salary certificate in this regard is on the record as Ex PW2/1 which is well proved by PW-2 18 Pratima Tyagi & Ors. vs. Samarpreet Singh & Ors . Neeraj Sharma, Director, Sai Ad Solutions (P) Ltd. The deceased was of young age and he was likely to be promoted at a higher post, therefore, he is entitled for future prospects. Apart from that, the claimants are also entitled to the expenditure on medical treatment of the deceased. The claimants are also entitled for compensation under usual heads i.e. compensation for loss of love & affection and the cremation expenses etc. 30The learned counsel for respondents, on the other hand, opposed the arguments. It is argued that the income of the deceased is not properly proved, there - fore, the claimants are not entitled for any compensation. 31It is further the contention of learned counsel for respondents no.1 & 2 that it is not established on record that claimant no.1 is the wife of deceased Shobit Tyagi. Moreover, the claimant no.2 Ms. Angel Tyagi is not daughter of Shobit Tyagi. The claimant no.1 while appearing as PW-1 has admitted in her cross-examination that deceased was not biological father of claimant no.2, therefore, they are not entitled for any compensation. 32The learned counsel for the claimants rebutted the arguments of ld. counsel for the respondents no.1 & 2. It is argued that marriage of claimant no.1 with deceased is well established. The claimant no.1 was earlier married with Sh. Amit Kapil and the said marriage was dissolved by a decree of divorce, copy of the same is on record as Ex P-7. Thereafter, she performed marriage with the deceased and the copy of marriage card is on the record as Ex P-8. The claimant no.2 was living with the deceased as his daughter. Therefore, they are entitled for compensation. 19 Pratima Tyagi & Ors. vs. Samarpreet Singh & Ors . 33The arguments advanced by the learned counsels for both the sides are duly considered apart from perusing the record. As far as age of the deceased is concerned, the age is alleged to be 25 years by the claimants in the evidence. As per copy of post mortem report Ex P-4, the age of the deceased as on the date of accident is 25 years and as per copy of PAN Card Ex P-11, the date of birth of the deceased is 7.5.1989. Therefore, the age of the deceased was 25 years as alleged by claimants. 34As far as the income of the deceased is concerned, his salary is well proved by PW2 Neeraj Sharma, Director, Sai Ad Solutions (P) Ltd, New Delhi and deposed that the deceased Shobhit Tyagi was working in their company as Marketing Executive and getting a salary of Rs.40,000/- per month. The income tax return for the assessment year 2015-16 i.e. financial year 2014-15 has also been placed on record as Ex PW2/2 which reflects his income as Rs.1,60,000/-, but this income is for four months only i.e. from October 2014 to January 2015. Apart from that, a copy of income tax return for the assessment year 2014-15 i.e. financial year 2013-14 has been placed on record as Ex P-17 which shows the gross total income of the deceased as Rs.2,04,000/- in the year prior to his death. In such circumstances, from the statement of PW-2 and from the assessment of the documents placed on record as Ex P-17, Ex PW2/1 & Ex PW2/2, his income is assessed as Rs.2,50,000/- per annum. 1/3rd income is to be deducted as personal expenses. In this way, the income for the purpose of compensation comes to the tune of Rs.1,66,667/-. The deceased was 25 years old at the time of accident, therefore, the multiplier of 18 is to be applied in view of the law laid down by Smt. Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Trans - port Corporation and Anr., 2009(3) RCR (Civil), 77. The amount of claim comes to the tune of Rs.166,667x18=Rs.30,00,006/- (in round figure Rs.30,00,000/-). As far as future prospects is concerned, the claimants have claimed the future 20 Pratima Tyagi & Ors. vs. Samarpreet Singh & Ors . prospectus @ 50% in view of the law laid down in Rajesh and others Versus Rajbir Singh and others, 2013(3) RCR (Civil) 170 . A perusal of the said case law reveals that future prospects is given at the rate of 50% for the age group of below 40 years. Therefore, calculating 50% income as future prospects, the future income of the deceased comes to Rs.15,00,000/-. Apart from that, claimant no.1 is entitled to Rs.1,00,000/- as loss of consortium, the claimants no.2 & 3 are entitled to Rs.50,000/- each as loss of love and affection. The ld. counsel for respondents no.1 & 2 has raised an objection that the claimant no.1 is not proved the wife of deceased and claimant no.2 is not biological daughter of the deceased, therefore, they are not entitled for compensation. In this regard, this Tribunal is of the view that marriage of claimant no.1 with deceased is well established. The claimant no.1 was earlier married with Sh. Amit Kapil and the said marriage was dissolved by a decree of divorce, copy of the same is on record as Ex P-7. Thereafter, she performed marriage with the deceased and the copy of marriage card is on the record as Ex P-8. The copy of Aadhar card of claimant no.1 is also on the record as Ex P-12 in which she is reflected as wife of deceased Shobit Tyagi. The claimant no.2 was living with the deceased as his daughter. This fact is clear from the Aadhar card of claimant no.2 which is on the record as Ex P-13 in which she is reflected as daughter of Shobit Tyagi. The claimant no.3 is the mother of the deceased which is made out from the copy of Aadhar card which is on the record as Ex P-14. Therefore, they are entitled for compensation. 35Apart from the compensation as discussed above, the claimants are further entitled to Rs.25,000/- as funeral expenses. Apart from that, the claimants are also entitled to Rs.4080/- as expenditure on medical treatment which is also proved vide medical bills placed on record as Ex P-18 & Ex P-19. In this way, the claimants 21 Pratima Tyagi & Ors. vs. Samarpreet Singh & Ors . are entitled for Rs.30,00,000/- + Rs.15,00,000/-+ Rs.2,00,000/- (Rs.100000+Rs.50000=Rs.50000) + Rs.25,000/- + Rs.4080/-= Rs.47,29,080/- (in round figure Rs.47,30,000/-). The claimants are also entitled for interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the realization of the whole of this amount. 36As far as liability of payment is concerned, as it has already been held that it was a composite negligence of respondent no.1 (driver of car no.HP-03-D- 2358) and of deceased Mankirat (driver of Pajero car no.CH-04-E-0067). As such, the joint & several responsibility of respondents no.1 to 3 to the extent of 50% on one side and the joint & several responsibility of respondents no.4 to 6 to the extent of 50% on other side. As it has also been held that respondent no.1 was a minor and was not possessing any driving license at the time of accident, hence the liability to make the payment shall be of respondent no.1(through his father respondent no.2) being driver and respondent no.2 being owner. However, the insurance company (respondent no.3) shall pay the amount of compensation at the first instance and shall have the right to recover the same from respondent no.1. As far as the remaining 50% amount of compensation is concerned, the same shall be paid by insurance com - pany (respondent no.5) as the Pajero car is allegedly insured with respondent no.5. 37In view of above discussion, issue no. 2 is decided in favour of claimants. ISSUE NO. 3 : 38In view of findings recorded under issue no.2, this issue is 22 Pratima Tyagi & Ors. vs. Samarpreet Singh & Ors . decided accordingly.

However, the insurance company (respondent no.3) shall pay the amount of compensation at the first instance and shall have the right to recover the same from respondent no.1.

At about 1 PM, she reached near House No.1717, Village Burail, UT, Chandigarh, in the meantime respondent no.1 came driving offending motorcycle bearing No.DL-55AE-7524 at a very high speed and in a rash and negligent manner and hit Lakhbir Kaur, as a result thereof she fell down on the road and suffered multiple injuries on vital organs of her body including head injury. She was taken to PGI, Chandigarh but despite best treatment given to her, she died on 13.6.2015 in PGI. This accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. 3.It is further case of the claimants that deceased was aged 69 years and was a housewife. She was very active, healthy, intelligent and was very efficient in household work. She was guide and philosopher for the claimants. She was rendering multifarious services for the claimants.

On account of death of Lakhbir Kaur, claimants suffered loss of love and affection. 4.Notice to respondents No.1 and 2 was duly served through 2 Balwinder Singh & ors.Vs. Muzammilali & ors. publication in newspaper but as none appeared on their behalf, therefore, they were proceeded ex parte vide order dated 4.11.2015. 5.Respondent No.3 in its written reply took preliminary objections that the claimants are not entitled to any compensation as they have not suffered any monetary loss. The driver of motorcycle bearing No.DL-AE-7524 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident. On merits, it was submitted that motorcycle in question was not insured with the answering respondent. Other averments made in the claim petition have been denied. 6.From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed: 1.Whether deceased Lakhbir Kaur died in a motor vehicle accident, which took place on 11.6.2015 at about 1 PM due to rash and negligent driving by respondent No.1 while driving vehicle No.DL- 55AE-7524?

He deposed that the FIR was registered on 13.6.2015. Nobody told him that vehicle bearing registration No.DL-55AE-7524 was involved in the accident. After seven days i.e. on 20.6.2015, complainant told him the number of the vehicle. No other person except complainant gave the number even after seven days. He has not given any documents of the alleged offending vehicle to the complainant. When cross examined, he stated that on 20.6.2015 supplementary statement of complainant was recorded, copy there of is Ex.PX. After recording supplementary statement, investigation was carried out on 2.7.2015. Muzammilali was arrested on the identification of Balwinder Singh. Respondent Muzammilali is facing trial in criminal Court. The challan has already been presented in the Court. Thereafter, learned counsel for respondent no.3 tendered into evidence insurance policy Ex.RX and closed his evidence. 9.I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and also gone through the record. My issue-wise findings are as under : - 4 Balwinder Singh & ors.Vs. Muzammilali & ors. Issue no.1. 10. In order to prove this issue, the claimant Balwinder Singh, who was the eye witness of the accident himself appeared as PW-1 and he deposed that on 11.6.2015, he alongwith his mother Lakhbir Kaur was going on foot from their home to main Bazaar, Village Burail, Chandigarh on correct left side. When at about 1 PM, they reached near House No.1717, Village Burail, UT, Chandigarh, in the meantime respondent no.1 came driving offending motorcycle bearing No.DL- 55AE-7524 at a very high speed in a rash and negligent manner and hit her mother Lakhbir Kaur. As a result of which, she fell down on the road and suffered multiple injuries on vital organs of her body including head injury. Though she was taken to PGI, Chandigarh but despite best treatment given to her, she died on 13.6.2015 in PGI. This accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. In his cross- examination, he deposed that his mother was ahead of him around ten paces from him. The motorcycle came from behind and struck into his mother and motorcyclist was coming at very high speed. The police came to the hospital and recorded his statement in GMCH, sector -32, Chandigarh. He got recorded the registration number of motorcycle as DL-55-AE-7524. He denied the suggestion put to him that the place of accident is crowded area. He further denied the suggestion that accident had occurred due to negligence of his mother, who was going on road without caring the traffic. 5 Balwinder Singh & ors.Vs. Muzammilali & ors. 11. Respondent No.1 has not contested the claim petition. Only he could deny the accident or explain the manner in which the accident was caused. As such adverse inference is liable to be taken against him. RW-1 in his cross examination stated that on 20.6.2015 supplementary statement of complainant was recorded, copy there of is Ex.PX. After recording supplementary statement, investigation was carried out on 2.7.2015. Muzammilali was arrested on the identification of Balwinder Singh. Respondent Muzammilali is facing trial in criminal Court. The challan has already been presented in the Court. It is proved on record that FIR No. 306 dated 13.6.2015 under Section 279,337 of IPC was registered at Police Station South sector -34, Chandigarh against him and challan against respondent No.1 was produced in the Court at Chandigarh. Respondent No.1 has never represented to any authority against his false implication. All these circumstances in their totality suggest that accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent No.1. 12. There is further evidence that deceased was going on foot alongwith his son from her house to Main Bazaar, Burail and when she reached near House No.1717, Burail, respondent no.1 came on a motorcycle bearing No.DL-55-AE-7524 at a high speed in a rash and negligent manner and hit the deceased Lakhbir Kaur. Due to which the deceased suffered grievous injuries leading to her death. The postmortem report is Exhibit P5. The cause of death was stated to be injury to the brain which is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. It 6 Balwinder Singh & ors.Vs. Muzammilali & ors. is, therefore, held that deceased died as a result of injuries sustained by her in a motor vehicular accident, which was caused by rash and negligent driving of offending motorcycle by respondent No.1. This issue is decided in favour of the claimant and against the respondents. Issue No.2. 13. Claimant no.1 is the son of the deceased. The deceased was stated to be 69 years of age at the time of accident. The deceased was a housewife. In the Death report, her age is mentioned as 70 years. The copy of voter identity card of deceased is placed on record as Exhibit P-6, wherein the age of deceased depicts as 67 years. No other evidence has come on record about the age of the deceased. Hence, the age as mentioned in the Death report is taken to be correct and thus, multiplier of 5 is applicable. 14. In the present case the deceased was a housewife. The assessment of compensation in case of death of a housewife is virtually impossible in terms of money, as a housewife takes care of all the requirements of her family. She teaches children and provides invaluable guidance to them for their future. Thus, in these circumstances, the income of the deceased is to be assessed keeping in view the income earned by a semi skilled worker. Accordingly, the notional income of the deceased is assessed at Rs.4,000/- per month. 15. It is well settled that no deduction is to be made from the 7 Balwinder Singh & ors.Vs. Muzammilali & ors. income of the housewife towards personal expenses as the services rendered by her cannot be measured in terms of money. The claimants are to be compensated for the loss suffered by them of personal care and attention and the services which deceased was rendering gratuitously out of her love and affection. 16. By taking the income of the deceased as Rs.4,000/- per month and applying multiplier of 5, the claimants are held entitled to get compensation of Rs.4,000 x 12 x 5 = 2,40,000/-. In the case of ₹ Rajesh and another v. Rajbir Singh 2013(3) RCR(Civil) 170, , the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that a sum of 25,000/- be awarded as ₹ compensation for funeral and last rites. Awarding said amounts to the claimants, the total amount of compensation to which the claimants are entitled thus comes to 2,65,000/-. Accordingly, both the claimants are ₹ held entitled to get compensation of 2,65,000/- in equal shares. ₹ This issue to the above extent is decided in favour of claimants and against the respondents. Issue No. 3. 17. The onus to prove this issue was on respondent No.3, which has not led any evidence. However, driving licence of respondent No.1 is placed on record Exhibit P3, which shows that the respondent No.1 was authorised to drive LMV-NT and Motorcycle and which is valid till 12.10.2030. It is, therefore, held that the respondent No.1 was authorised to drive the offending motorcycle. It is, therefore, held that 8 Balwinder Singh & ors.Vs. Muzammilali & ors. respondent No.3 has failed to prove this issue, which is decided against it and in favour of respondent No.1. Issue No.4 (Relief). 18. In view of findings on issues above, the claim petition is allowed with costs and an Award for 2,65,000/- ₹(Two lacs sixty five thousand) only, is passed in favour of the claimants in equal shares and against the respondents. The claimants shall further be entitled to interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of claim petition, in case the payment is made within three months from the date of award. In default, the claimant will be entitled to interest at the rate of 8% per annum from the date of claim petition till payment. The respondents shall be jointly and severally liable to pay the Award amount. Counsel fee is assessed as 3,000/-. Memo of costs be prepared. File be consigned to the record₹ room.

Kartar Singh, counsel for claimants. Sh. Rohit Khullar, counsel for respondents no.1 & 2. Sh.Simrandeep Singh, counsel for respondent no.3. 2 Shakuntala Devi & Ors. Vs Girish Kumar & Ors . A W A R D The claimants have filed the present claim petition under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act for seeking compensation to the tune of Rs.30 lacs on account of death of Narinder Kumar caused in a road side vehicular accident. 2 While providing the particulars as required under the Motor Vehicles Act and the Rules framed thereunder the claimants interalia alleged that on 30.6.2015, the offending loaded truck no.HR-39-C-1894 was parked near Shivalik Gas Agency, Sector 26, Chandigarh. At about 10.20 a.m., respondent no.1 Girish Kumar, driver of the offending truck came and without seeing and caring about any person standing in front and back side of truck, went to the driving seat. At once soon as he sat upon the driver seat, he started the offending truck with high speed without looking towards back side of the said truck and hit Narinder Kumar, the deceased. In the meantime, persons standing there raised hue and cry, despite hearing that respondent no.1 reversed the offending truck, as a result of which the rear tyre of the conductor side of the offending truck passed over Narinder Kumar. As a result of that Narinder Kumar suffered multiple injuries on vital organs of his body due to which he died at the spot. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. 3The deceased was 24 years old at the time of accident, working as Conductor with offending truck and earning Rs.12,000/- per month including over time. Immediately after the accident, Narinder was 3 Shakuntala Devi & Ors. Vs Girish Kumar & Ors . taken to GMSH Sector 16, Chandigarh where he was declared brought dead. Police Station Sector 26, Chandigarh registered the FIR. The deceased was hale and hearty and was very efficient in his work. He was the sole earning member of the family and all the claimants were dependent upon the income of the deceased. The claimants are entitled for loss of love and affection, loss of estate and also for the expenses incurred upon last rites of the deceased. Therefore, award of Rs.30 lacs may be granted to the claimants along with interest @ 24% per annum from the date of accident till its actual realization. 4 In response to the notice, the respondents appeared. The respondents no.1 & 2 filed written statement taking preliminary objections that the petition is not maintainable in the present form. The answering respondent has been wrongly arrayed and dragged into the present case just to harass the answering respondent. The claimants have concealed the material and true facts from this court and have not come to the court with clean hands. 5 While replying on merits, it is denied that the accident took place on 30.6.2015 at about 10.20 am near Shivalik Garden Agency Parking, Sector 26, Chandigarh. It is submitted that the answering respondent had been dragged and falsely roped in the present case whereas he has no conern with any accident whatsoever alleged by the claimant. It is submitted that vehicle in question is insured from M/s Cholamandlam MS General Insurance Company Ltd., Hisar, Haryana. Therefore, the claim petition may be dismissed with costs, in the interest of justice. 4 Shakuntala Devi & Ors. Vs Girish Kumar & Ors . 6Respondent no.3 filed written statement taking preliminary objections that the petition is not maintainable. The claim petition does not come under the purview of MACT Act rather it falls under Workmen Compensation Act. The driver of the truck no.HR-39-C-1894 was not having driving license at the time of alleged ccident. If it is proved that the driver was having license, the same was not valid and effective driving license to drive the vehicle in question at the time of alleged accident, rather it was fake. The vehicle does not have valid permit and fitness at the time of alleged accident and the vehicle was driven in violation of terms and conditions of insurance policy. Thus the insurance company is not liable to indemnify the owner qua the alleged accident. The vehicle was being used without having been properly registered and it was being used in violation of the authorization as to use, thereby the respondent no.1 has committed gross deliberate breach of terms and conditions of the insurance policy, hence the answering respondent cannot be held liable. If this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the compensation is to be paid to the claimant, then the rate of interest on the amount of award cannot be more than 6% p.a. The Motor Vehicle Act or rules does not specify the rate of interest. Hence, the Interest Act, 1978 is applicable for the determination of interest in Motor Accident Tribunal cases. Without prejudice to the rights and contention of the answering respondent, the claimant may be directed to furnish the details of PAN number which may be required as per the provisions of IT Act. 7While replying on merits, most of the averments have been denied. It is further submitted that the policy particulars of the insured 5 Shakuntala Devi & Ors. Vs Girish Kumar & Ors . vehicle are subject to confirmation from the issuing authority and policey is subject to compliance of 64(v)(b) of the Insurance Act. The amount claimed is highly inflated and hypothetical. No alleged accident took place on 30.6.2015. It is denied that the alleged accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. Therefore, the claim petition be dismissed with costs, against the answering respondent, in the interest of justice. 8From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed vide order dated 24.11.2015:- 1 Whether accident dated 30.6.2015 resulting in death of Narinder, occurred on account of rash and negligent driving of vehicle no.HR-39-C-1894 by respondent no.1? OPP. 2 Whether the claimants are entitled to compensation for death of Narinder, if so, to what extent and from whom? OPR. 3 Whether the driver of offending vehicle was not holding a valid & effective driving license on the date of accident and the vehicle was being driven in violation of terms and conditions of the insurance policy? OPR2. 4 Relief. 9To substantiate their respective claims the parties led their evidence. 10The claimants have examined as many as two witnesses in all. The claimants examined the claimant no.2 Hukmi Lal as PW-1. Pardeep Rawat s/o Rajinder Singh Rawat who was eye witness was examined as PW-2. Documents Ex P-1 to Ex P-3 were tendered in evidence. Thereafter, the evidence of the claimants was closed. 6 Shakuntala Devi & Ors. Vs Girish Kumar & Ors . 11On the other hand, the ld. counsel for respondents no.1 & 2 tendered in evidence documents Ex R-1 to Ex R-7 and ld. counsel for respondent no.8 tendered document Ex P-8 . Thereafter, evidence was closed. 12No rebuttal evidence was adduced by the claimant. 13The learned counsels for both the parties were heard. The issue wise findings with reasons thereof are as follows : ISSUE No. 1: 14To substantiate this issue, the ld. counsel for the claimants argued that Pardeep Rawat s/o Rajinder Singh Rawat, the eye witness of the accident has appeared as PW-2 and proved the accident. He deposed that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. He deposed about the number of the offending truck as as HR-39-C-1894 and name of the driver as Girish Kumar. Ld. counsel further argued that FIR has been registered against Girish Kumar for causing the accident. Therefore, from the statement of Pardeep Rawat PW-2 corroborated with the fact that the FIR Ex P-1 was registered against the respondent no.1 and the copy of post mortem examination report Ex P-2, the rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1, the accident and the death of Narinder Kumar in the accident are well proved. 7 Shakuntala Devi & Ors. Vs Girish Kumar & Ors . 15The learned counsel for the respondents no.1 & 2, on the other hand, opposed the arguments of learned counsel for the claimants. The ld. counsel argued that it is wrong to say that the accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. He further argued that the accident and rash & negligent driving is not proved from the statement of PW-2. There is no other evidence on the record to prove the accident and rash & negligent driving. The FIR is not sufficient to prove the accident and rash & negligent driving. Otherwise also, the vehicle in question was insured one, therefore, respondents no.1 or 2 are not liable to pay any compensation in any manner. 16Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 argued on the same lines as that of respondent no.1 as regard to accident. He further alleged that the alleged FIR was registered on the statement of one Jaikaran and he has not been examined. PW-2 is not an eye witness, therefore, PW-2 cannot be relied upon. In such circumstances, the accident as alleged is not proved. 17The arguments advanced by learned counsel for both the sides are duly considered apart from perusing the record. To prove the accident, the claimants have examined Pardeep Rawat as PW-2 who is stated to be the eye witness of the accident. He has deposed that on 30.6.2015 at about 10.20 a.m., while he was standing near Shivalik Gas Agency, he saw Girish Kumar, driver of offending truck no.HR-39-C-1894 came to his truck without seeing here and there and caring about any person standing in front and back side of his truck and quickly went to the driver seat. As soon as he sat upon the driver seat, he started the offending truck with high speed 8 Shakuntala Devi & Ors. Vs Girish Kumar & Ors . without looking towards back side of the truck and hit Narinder Kumar. He and other persons raised hue & cry and despite that respondent no.1 reversed the offending truck, as a result of which rear tyre of conductor side of the offending truck passed over Narinder Kumar. As a result of that Narinder Kumar suffered multiple injuries on vital organs of his body due to which he died on the spot. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. His statement was recorded by the police. From the statement of PW-2 corroborated with the fact of recording of FIR Ex P1, the facing of trial by the respondent no.1 and the copy of post mortem report Ex P-2, the accident, the rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and the death of Narinder Kumar in the accident are well established. The statement of PW-2 cannot be discarded merely on the ground that he is not the author of the FIR. He stated that his statement was recorded by the police. The witness has given a natural version and his confidence could not be shaken during his cross-examination. If the statement of the witness is found trustworthy, then it can be relied upon and cannot be discarded merely on the ground that his name is not shown in the FIR. 18Apart from above, the accident and rash and negligent driving is to be proved beyond reasonable doubt in criminal trial only. In the civil matters, like claim petitions, the accident and rash and negligent can be proved with the help of preponderance of probabilities also. Reliance in this regard can be given of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in case titled as Kusum Lata and others Vs. Satbir and others, 2011(4) LJR 512. In such circumstances, the rash and negligent driving, the accident and the death of Narinder Kumar in accident are well proved. 9 Shakuntala Devi & Ors. Vs Girish Kumar & Ors . 19In view of above discussion, issue No. 1 is decided in favour of claimants. ISSUE NO. 2 : 20 To substantiate this issue, the learned counsel for the claimant argued that the deceased was 24 years old, employed as conductor with the offending truck and earning Rs12,000/- per month. The ld. counsel submitted that the compensation be assessed accordingly. The ld. counsel submitted that the claimants are entitled for 50% increase in the income of deceased as future prospectus. In support of his arguments, the ld. counsel relied upon the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case titled as Rajesh and ors. vs. Rajbir Singh and ors. 2013(3) RCR (Civil) 170. 21The learned counsel for respondents, on the other hand, opposed the arguments. It is argued that claimants have failed to prove that the deceased was working as Conductor and they failed to prove the income of the deceased by way of evidence, therefore, the claimants are not entitled for any claim. The ld. counsel for respondent no.3 further argued that if any claim is made out, then it is to be assessed by taking the multiplier as per age of parents of deceased and not the age of deceased. 23 The arguments advanced by ld counsel for both the side are duly considered part from perusing the record. As far as age of the deceased is 10 Shakuntala Devi & Ors. Vs Girish Kumar & Ors . concerned, the age is alleged to be 24 years by the claimants in the evidence. As per post mortem report Ex P-2, the age is 24 years. As such, the age of the deceased is taken 24 years at the time of accident. 24 As far as the income of the deceased is concerned, there is nothing cogent on record by way of evidence that he was working as Conductor and earning Rs.12,000/- per month. No income proof has been produced on record. However, deceased was hale and hearty and he was able bodied person. He could earn by performing labour work. Therefore, his income is to be assessed as per Collector rate. Keepping in view the minimum wages for a daily wager notified by the State, a sum of Rs.6000/- per month is taken as monthly income of the deceased at the time of accident. As such, the annual income of the deceased comes to Rs.72,000/-. As far as deduction is concerned, the deceased was bachelor, therefore deduction should be 1/2. In such circumstances, the income for the purpose of compensation comes to the tune of Rs.36,000/- per annum. The deceased was 24 years old at the time of accident, therefore, the multiplier of 18 is to be applied in view of the law laid down by Smt. Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Anr., 2009(3) RCR (Civil), 77. The ld. counsel for respondent no.3 has pressed that multiplier as per age of parents is to be taken as deceased was bachelor. In this regard, this Tribunal is of the view that multiplier is to be used as per the age of the deceased in case of bachelor also. Reliance in this regard can be placed on the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in the case titled as Amrit Bhanu Shali and others Vs. National Insurance Co. Ltd. and others, 2012(4) RCR(Civil) 343. In this 11 Shakuntala Devi & Ors. Vs Girish Kumar & Ors . way, the amount of claim comes to the tune of Rs.36,000x18 = Rs.6,48,000/-. As far as future prospects is concerned, the claimants have claimed the future prospectus @ 50% in view of the law laid down in Rajesh and others Versus Rajbir Singh and others, 2013(3) RCR (Civil) 170. A perusal of the said case law reveals that future prospects is given at the rate of 50% for the age group of below 40 years. Therefore, considering 50% income as future prospects, the future income of the deceased comes to Rs.3,24,000/-. Apart from that, claimants are entitled to Rs.50,000/- each as loss of love and affection and claimants are further entitled to Rs.25,000/- as funeral expenses. In this way, the claimants are entitled for Rs.6,48,000/- + Rs.3,24,000/- + Rs.2,00,000/- (Rs.50000+Rs.50000+50000+50000) + Rs.25,000/- = Rs.11,97,000/-. The claimants are also entitled for interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the realization of the whole of this amount. 25 The liability to make the payment is joint and several of all the respondents. However, the insurance company i.e. respondent no.3 is required to make the payment as vehicle in question was insured one vide insurance policy Ex P-3/Ex R-8 and respondent no.3 is bound to indemnify the respondent no.2, registered owner of the vehicle in question. 26 In view of above discussion, issue no. 2 is decided in favour of claimants. ISSUE NO. 3: 27This issue was not specifically pressed at the time of 12 Shakuntala Devi & Ors. Vs Girish Kumar & Ors . arguments. However, otherwise also there is nothing on record to prove this issue and the copy of driving license of respondent no.1 has been placed on record as Ex. R-1. Therefore, this issue is decided against the respondent no.3. RELIEF: 28 In view of above discussion, it is held that the claimants are entitled for compensation and an award of Rs.11,97,000/- (Rs. Eleven Lacs Ninety Seven thousand only) is hereby passed in favour of claimants and against the respondents no.1 to 3 along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the realization of the whole of this amount. However, the insurance company is required to make the payment as vehicle in question was insured one. The share of compensation amount of the claimants shall be as under:- Claimant no.1 = 50% Claimant no.2 = 30% Claimant no.3 = 10% Claimant no.4 = 10% The half amount of compensation of claimants no.1 and 2 and entire amount of claimants no.3 and 4 shall be deposited in the bank account of the claimants on submitting copy of pass book.

OPA. 2.Whether the claimants are entitled to compensation on account of death of Shallender Behl ? If yes, from whom and to which extent ? OPA. 3.Whether the driver of offending vehicle was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident ? OPR3. 4.Relief. 7.In order to prove the assertions as made in the claim petition, claimants examined claimant No.3 Akshit Behl, son of the deceased as PW.1 and Anil Behl, brother of the deceased and eye witness as PW.2, and thereafter, the counsel for the claimants closed the evidence. 8.The counsel for respondent No.1 tendered into evidence driving licence as Exhibit R1 and closed the evidence. The respondent No.2 examined Shri Kulwant Chand as RW.1 and thereafter, learned Government Pleader closed the evidence. 9.I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and also gone through the record. My issue-wise findings are as under : Issue No.1. Whether deceased Shallender Behl died in a motor vehicle accident, which took place on 31.1.2015 at about 9.30 pm due to rash and negligent driving by respondent No.1 ? OPP. 10. The onus to prove this issue was on the claimants. In 4 Meena Behl v. Sakatar Singh order to prove this issue, the claimant Akshit Behl, who was the son of the deceased appeared as PW.1. He deposed that deceased was his father, who died in a motor vehicular accident at the age of 45 years. PW.2 Anil Behl, who was the eye witness, has deposed that on 31.1.2015 he alongwith his brother Shallender Behl and his cousin were coming in Car No. CH-01-AV-9800 from Sirsa to Chandigarh. Sanjay Kumar son of Birampal was driving the said car. At about 9.30 pm, when they reached in the area of Bhikhi Town, in the mean time, respondent No.1 came driving offending jeep No. PB-11-AX-7803 at a very high rash speed and in zig-zag manner from opposite direction and hit their car with much force. Due to this all the occupants of the car suffered injuries, whereas his brother Shallender Behl suffered multiple injuries on vital organs of his body including head injuries. After the accident, he was taken to Government hospital, Mansa, and thereafter to DMC Hospital, Ludhiana, where he was declared brought dead. This accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1. FIR Exhibit P2 was recorded on his statement. In his cross-examination, the witness deposed that their car was on the correct left side at the time of accident. He denied the suggestion that their car was being driven in negligent manner. He further denied the suggestion that no accident took place on 31.1.2015 at 9.30 pm with vehicle No. PB-11-AX-7803, which was being driven by Sakatar Singh driver. He further denied the suggestion that no one had died in this accident. 11. Respondent No.1 has not contested the claim petition by 5 Meena Behl v. Sakatar Singh appearing in the Court for recording of his testimony. Only he could deny the accident or explain the manner in which the accident was caused. 12. As stated above, PW.2 is the eye witness to the occurrence. He has proved in his statement that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the driver of the offending jeep. He was sitting next to the deceased at the time of accident. Respondent No.1 is also facing trial for causing this accident. He has never represented to any authority against his false implication. All these circumstances in their totality suggest that accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent No.1. Moreover, the respondents failed to prove that there was any negligence on the part of deceased. 13. There is further evidence that deceased died due to injuries suffered in the accident. The postmortem report is Exhibit P3. The cause of death was stated to be hemorrhage and shock as a result of injury to vital organs, which is sufficient to cause death in ordinary course of nature. The injuries were antemortem in nature. It is, therefore, held that deceased died as a result of injuries sustained by him in a motor vehicular accident, which was caused by rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1. This issue is decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. Issue No.2. Whether the claimants are entitled to compensation on account of death of Shallender Behl ? If yes, from whom and 6 Meena Behl v. Sakatar Singh to which extent ? OPA. 14. PW.1 Akshit is the son of the deceased. He has stated that deceased was 45 years old at the time of accident. He further deposed that the deceased was an industrialist. He was partner of the firm namely, Shree Hari Om Industries, situated at Village Bathari, Tehsil Haroli, District Una, Himachal Pradesh to the extent of 50% share and remaining 50% share was in the name of Anil Behl. Due to the death of the deceased, the abovesaid firm had been dissolved and there was no income from the said firm. Claimant No.1 is the wife of the deceased, whereas claimants No.2 & 3 are the children and claimant No.4 is the mother of the deceased. All the claimants were dependent upon the income of the deceased. 15. PW.1 has stated that the deceased was an income-tax assessee. He produced on record the income-tax return for the assessment year 2014-15 alongwith computation sheet, wherein, the income from business has been shown as 1,19,240/- and income from other misc. ₹ sources has been shown as 97,114/-. As such, the total income of the ₹ deceased was 2,16,354/-. Apart from this, he was partner of Shree Hari ₹ Om Industries to the extent of 50%. As per income-tax return filed by the firm for the assessment year 2014-15, the total income has been shown as 3,62,291/-. 50% of the said amount comes to 1,81,145/-. Thus, the₹ ₹ total income of the deceased comes to 1,81,145/- + 2,16,354/- = ₹ ₹ 3,97,499/- per annum. ₹ 7 Meena Behl v. Sakatar Singh 16. As per postmortem report Exhibit P3, the deceased was 45 years of age at the time of his death. Multiplier of 14 is applicable. 1/3rd of the income is liable to be deducted as personal expenses of the deceased, which comes to 1,32,499/-. The balance comes to ₹ 2,65,000/-. Applying multiplier of 14, the loss of dependency comes to₹ 37,10,000/-.₹ 17. In the case of Rajesh and another v. Rajbir Singh 2013(3) RCR(Civil) 170, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that a sum of 1.00 lac be awarded as compensation for loss of consortium and ₹ another sum of 25,000/- for funeral and last rites. Awarding said ₹ amounts to the claimants, the total amount of compensation to which the claimants are entitled thus comes to 38,35,000/-. Accordingly, the ₹ claimants are held entitled to get compensation of 38,35,000/-. Claimant ₹ No.1 is entitled to 40% share of the total compensation amount, whereas claimants No.2 to 4 are entitled to 20% share each of the total compensation amount. This issue to the above extent is decided in favour of claimants and against the respondents. Issue No.3. Whether the driver of offending vehicle was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident ? OPR3. 18. The offending vehicle was not insured with any insurance company. As such, there is no need to give any finding on this issue. 8 Meena Behl v. Sakatar Singh Issue No.4 (Relief). 19.

The counsel for the claimant closed the evidence. The respondents No. 1 tendered into evidence registration certificate Exhibit R1, driving licence Exhibit R2 and insurance policy Exhibit R3 closed the evidence on her behalf and on behalf of respondent No.2. The counsel for respondent No.3 also closed 3 Rahul v. Kirat Dhillon the evidence. 7.I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and also gone through the record. My issue-wise findings are as under : Issue No.1. Whether claimant received injuries in an accident caused by respondent No.1 while driving vehicle No. CH-01-AK-9344 in rash and negligent manner ? OPP. 8.The onus to prove this issue was on the claimant. The claimant while deposing in his examination-in-chief by virtue of an affidavit Exhibit PW1/A has stated that at the time of accident on 18.5.2015 at about 6.30 pm, he, while driving motorcycle, was going towards his home via Governor house. When he reached near Leasure Vally, Sector 10, Chandigarh, suddenly a car bearing registration No. CH-01-AK-9344, which was being driven rashly and negligently by respondent No.1, took a sudden turn towards parking of Leasure Vally and as such, the car struck against his motorcycle. Due to which, he fell down and his right leg was badly crushed under the wheel of the car. He was taken to Government Hospital, Sector 16, Chandigarh, from where he was referred to PGI, Chandigarh, where he was operated upon and his right leg was amputated. The said accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving by respondent No.1, who took sudden turn without giving any indication. 4 Rahul v.

He also denied the suggestion that he became unconscious after the accident and did not note the number of the said car. He further denied the suggestion that a false FIR was registered against respondent No.1. 10. Respondent No.1 has not contested the claim petition. Only he could deny the accident or explain the manner in which the accident was caused. As such adverse inference is liable to be taken against her. 11. It is thus clear that respondent No.1 was driving the offending car in rash and negligent manner and due to her rash and negligent driving she hit her car against the claimant, which resulted in causing the injuries to the claimant. It is, therefore, held that claimant received injuries in the accident which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of the offending car by respondent No.1. This issue is decided in favour of the claimant and against the respondents. Issue No. 2. Whether the respondent No.1 was not having a valid driving licence at the time of accident ? OPR. 12. The onus to prove this issue was upon respondent No.3, 5 Rahul v. Kirat Dhillon which has not brought any evidence that respondent No.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence to drive the offending vehicle as on the date of accident. Driving licence of respondent No.1 has been placed on record as Exhibit R2, which shows that she was authorized to drive LMV only. As such, it is held that respondent No.1 was authorised to driver the offending vehicle at the time of accident. This issue is, therefore, decided against respondent No.3 and in favour of other respondents. Issue No.3. Whether the claimant is entitled to compensation, if so, from whom and to which extent ? OPP. 13. There is statement made by the claimant that there was amputation of his right leg. He remained handicapped throughout his life. He cannot walk, sit, stand, run without the help of walking aid. He cannot lift weight and cannot drive motorcycle/scooter and car. The doctors have advised the claimant for the artificial limb, but the cost of the limb is very high and he is unable to get the artificial limb fixed. It is not one time expenditure, which the claimant has to incur for the artificial limb, but after few years he needs to get it changed. The claimant proved the medical bills Exhibit P5 to P24 amounting to 19,276/-.₹ 14. The claimant has examined PW.2 Ashwani Kumar 6 Rahul v. Kirat Dhillon Verma, Prosthesis and Orthothetics, Deep Artificial Limb Centre, Industrial Area, Phase II, Chandigarh, who has deposed that the quotation Exhibit P4 for artificial limb amounting to 5,04,000/- is ₹ correct. He further deposed that the artificial limb fixed once cannot be for whole life. It depends upon the change in body of patient. The artificial limb consists of two parts; Socket and Foot (component) and the life of socket is six months and the life of foot (component) is two to three years. As such the claimant is held entitled to a sum of 5,04,000/- ₹ as compensation for the expenses incurred on the purchase of artificial limb. 15. PW.3 Dr. Ram Kishan, Department of Orthopedics, PGIMER, Chandigarh has deposed on behalf of Dr. Aditya Aggarwal, who was the member of the Board to conduct the test to determine the disability of Rahul. He identified the signatures of Dr. Aditya Aggarwal on disability ability certificate Exhibit P26. He further deposed that patient suffered 70% permanent disability. In his cross-examination, the doctor deposed that the permanent disability will not likely to improve and patient would have difficulty in walking, running and even in day to day activities. The patient can only do sitting job and he will not be able to seek employment in police, army and marketing jobs. The doctor further deposed that marketing job is not advisable, as the patient would suffer fatigue. The doctor further deposed that the disability is confined to limb only. The disability was found to be non-progressive and not likely to improve. The reassessment of disability was not necessary. 7 Rahul v. Kirat Dhillon Patient required the help of an attendant subsequent to his injury during his treatment in the hospital and at home. He required special high protein diet for early recovery. With the use of artificial limb the patient may get some help in walking but it will not improve his functional disability. 16. As regards pain and suffering, the left leg of the claimant has been amputated. There was amputation of right leg. He cannot walk for a long time and cannot run. He cannot climb stairs. The entire career of the claimant has been ruined due to amputation and injuries he sustained in the accident. The earning capacity of the claimant has been diminished. In the given circumstances, the claimant is held entitled to a sum of 50,000/- for pain and suffering. Many activities of the claimant ₹ must have been restricted from the date of accident and despite recovery, he won't be able to enjoy the life in the manner he was enjoying prior to the accident. A small accident sometimes leaves scar physical as well as mental for whole of the life. In the present case, there is amputation of the leg in addition to may other injuries. Whatever be the advancements in science, the original cannot be given back. The artificial limb is man made. It is no substitute for the original leg. The artificial limb has its own limitations. It has its own life span. It may have to be got repaired at regular intervals. Some of its parts may have to replaced. Keeping in view all these circumstances, the claimant is awarded compensation of 50,000/- for loss of enjoyment. ₹ 8 Rahul v. Kirat Dhillon 17. As regards attendant, it is true that the claimant remained on bed for some period and was attended by his family members, who had to leave their work in order to look after the claimant. Keeping in view the nature of injuries, the claimant is awarded a consolidated sum of 10,000/- for the attendant.₹ 18. As regards transportation, the claimant was taken to PGI on the date of accident. He was discharged from the hospital on 24.5.2012, which means that he remained admitted in the hospital for a period of about 6 days. He was advised follow-up in the OPD. Keeping in view the number of visits paid by him to the hospital for follow-up treatment, he is awarded a sum of 10,000/- as compensation for ₹ transportation. 19. As regards special diet, prices of dietary articles are increasing. The claimant may have been advised fruits, protein rich diet, soups, juices, etc and also to take dietary supplements in order to cover up for the loss of vitamins and minerals. Keeping in view the rise in prices of essential commodities, the claimant is awarded a sum of 10,000/- as claimed by him for special diet.₹ 20. As regards loss of income, there is only oral statement made by the claimant that he was a student of 10+2 at the time of accident. However, a student with the qualification of 10+2 certainly would have earned a sum of 6,000/- per month by giving tuition to the ₹ 9 Rahul v. Kirat Dhillon children. As such, the monthly income of the claimant is taken to be 6,000/- per month. With the injuries, which claimant suffered, he₹ must have remained on bed for alteast four months. As such the loss of income comes to 6,000/- x 4 = 24,000/-. ₹ 21. As regards permanent disability, in Raj Kumar v. Ajay Kumar and another 2011 ACJ 1 , Hon'ble Supreme Court observed that disability refers to any restriction of lack of ability to perform an activity in the manner considered normal for a human being. Permanent disability refers to the residuary incapacity or loss of use of some part of the body, found existing at the end of the period of treatment and recuperation, after achieving the maximum bodily improvement or recovery which is likely to remain for the remainder life of the injured..... Total permanent disability refers to a person's inability to perform any avocation or employment related activities as a result of the accident.....The percentage of permanent disability is expressed by the doctor with reference to the whole body, or more often than not, with reference to a particular limb. When a disability certificate states that the injured had suffered permanent disability to an extent of 45% of the left lower limb, it is not the same as 45% permanent disability with reference to the whole body..... The Tribunal has proceeded on the basis that the permanent disability of the injured-claimant was 45% and loss of his future earning capacity was also 45%. The Tribunal overlooked the fact that the disability certificate referred to 45% disability with reference to left lower limb and not in regard to entire body. The said extent of 10 Rahul v. Kirat Dhillon permanent disability of the limb could not be considered to be the functional disability of the body nor could it be assumed to result in a corresponding extent of loss of earning capacity, as the disability would not have prevented him from carrying on his avocation as a cheese vendor, though it might impede in his smooth functioning.... we propose to access the permanent functional disability of the body as 25% and loss of future earning capacity as 20%. 22. In the present case, the claimant has suffered 70% disability. The permanent disability as assessed by the medical board is functional disability. The claimant will be finding difficulty to do prolonged sittings or to sit in any particular posture for long. The claimant will have difficulty in sitting, squatting and climbing stairs. He has virtually become totally handicapped. Man with amputated leg can only do sitting jobs even after fixation of artificial limb. The claimant was aged 17 years on the day of accident. Taking his monthly income as 6,000/-, 70% of the monthly income comes to 4,200/-. Applying₹ ₹ multiplier of 18, the total loss of income comes to 9,07,200/-. ₹ 23. In view of discussion made above, the claimant is held entitled to the various amounts as compensation for injuries suffered by him in the accident under various heads as given below : 11 Rahul v. Kirat Dhillon Sr. No. Head Amount( ) ₹ 1Medical charges. 19,276/-₹ 2Transportation charges. 10,000/-₹ 3Compensation for engaging an attendant. 10,000/-₹ 4Compensation for special diet. 10,000/-₹ 5Pain and suffering 50,000/-₹ 6Compensation for loss of enjoyment 50,000/-₹ 7Compensation for permanent disability 9,07,200/-₹ 8Compensation for artificial limb 5,04,000/-₹ Total15,60,476/-₹ 24.

Present: Thakur Kartar Singh, counsel for claimant. Sh. Baljit Singh, counsel for respondents no.1 and 2. Sh. Kapil Gupta, counsel for respondent no.3. A W A R D:- 1. The claimant filed the present claim petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act seeking compensation on account of damage to the canter No.CH-04L-9689 caused in a motor vehicle accident on 13.10.2014. 2. The brief facts of the case are that on 13.10.2014, Lakhbir Singh, driver of claimant was coming from Gurgaon to Chandigarh by driving canter No.CH-04L-9689. When at about 10.30 PM, he reached near Bidhana Mor, PS Jhajjar and was driving on his correct left side at normal speed, in the meantime respondent no.1 Jagdish came driving truck trolla No.HR-46A-5667 from the side of Rohtak at a high speed in a rash and negligent manner and that too by coming on the wrong side hit the canter of claimant, as a result thereof, the canter of claimant was damaged extensively. The canter was brought to Chandigarh through recovery van for which the claimant paid a sum of Rs.15,000/- and for repair of canter, claimant made payment of Rs.2,48,985/- to M/S Rajeev Motors, SCO No.291, Mani Majra, Chandigarh. Claimant is engaged in the business but due to accident and damage of their canter, claimant could not use the same for the period of about six months, thus 2 M/S Innovative Group Vs Jagdish & ors. claimant suffered loss of Rs.50,000/- per month as he was deprived of the use of canter. Hence, this petition. 3. Upon notice respondents no.1 and 2 contested the claim of the claimant, inter alia pleaded that the accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of Lakhbir Singh- driver of claimant. FIR was also registered against Lakhbir Singh on the statement of respondent No.1, so the present claim petition is not maintainable. The petitioner has no cause of action to file the petition. While denying all other averments, made in the claim petition, a prayer has been made for dismissal of the same. 4. Separate written statement was filed by respondent no.3 taking preliminary objections that present petition is not maintainable. Accident has taken place due to rash and negligent driving of truck No.CH-04L-9689 while driving his truck rashly and negligently. The claimant took compensation from his own insurer i.e. The Oriental Insurance company Ltd. The claim petition is bad for non-joinder and mis-joinder of necessary parties. Vehicle bearing No.HR-46A-5667 was not having a valid and effective permit to ply truck and also not having valid and effective fitness certificate at the time of accident. Rest of the averments were denied and a prayer for dismissal of petition was made. 3 M/S Innovative Group Vs Jagdish & ors. 5. From the pleading of the parties following issues were framed :- 1. Whether the canter of claimant bearing No.CH-04L-9689 was damaged in an accident caused by respondent no. 1 while driving vehicle No. HR-46A-5667 in a rash and negligent manner? OPA 2. Whether the claimant is entitled to compensation, if so, from whom and to which extent?OPP 3. Whether respondent No.1 was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident? OPR 4. Relief. 6. Claimant in order to prove its case examined Surjit Singh, Director as PW-1, who deposed through his affidavit Ex.PW1/A reiterating the averments of petition regarding the manner whereby accident took place. He also placed on record copy of resolution dated 12.11.2010 Ex.P-1, photocopies of bills dated 23.3.2015 for Rs.33,300/- and bill dated 25.3.2015 for Rs.2,15,985/- Ex.P-2 and Ex.P-3. The payments of bills were paid after deducting TDS amounting to Rs.2230/- from the bill amount. Copy of Form 16A is Ex.P-4. Copy of judgement dated 8.4.2015 in FIR No.786 4 M/S Innovative Group Vs Jagdish & ors. dated 11.11.2014 is Ex.P-5. Judgement of MACT case No.20 of 2015 titled as Narayan Das Ahuja Vs. Lakhbir Singh dated 22.12.2015 Ex.P-6, whereby it was held that Lakhbir Singh was not at fault, copy of insurance policy is Ex.P-7 and copy of RC of vehicle of claimant is Ex.P-8. When cross examined, he stated that he lodged his claim with his own insurer of truck i.e. Oriental Insurance company Limited and his claim was repudiated. 7. PW-2 Lakhbir Singh tendered his affidavit Ex.PW2/A reiterating the manner whereby accident took place on account of rash and negligent act of respondent no.1, who was driving truck- trolla and struck against his canter thereby extensive damage was caused to the canter. When cross examined he stated that he did not give any complaint to the higher police official or in the Court that a false FIR was registered against him. He had given a written complaint against Jagdish in the police station but he cannot produce the copy of the same. He made complaint to the police in the night of 13.10.2014. The other truck i.e. truck of respondent no.2 was also got damaged. 8. PW-3 Amit Soni, employee of M/S Rajiv Motors, Mani Majra, Chandigarh stated that he is a summoned witness. He stated that bills Ex.P-2 , Ex.P-3 and Ex.P-11 were issued by Rajiv Motors 5 M/S Innovative Group Vs Jagdish & ors. under the signatures of Sh. Rajiv Kumar, whose signatures he identified. 9. Thereafter, the learned counsel for claimants tendered certified copies of judgments Ex.P-9 dated 8.4.2015 and Ex.P-10 dated 22.12.2015 and closed the evidence of claimant. 10.Learned counsel for respondents No.1 and 2 tendered into evidence certified copy of written statement Ex.R-1, attested copy of mechanical report Ex.R-2, copy of insurance policy Ex.R-3, copy of RC Ex.R-4, attested copy of route permit Ex.R-5, attested copy of DL Ex.R-6, attested copy of site plan Ex.R-7, attested copy of mechanical report Ex.R-8 and closed their evidence. 11.Respondent no.3 examined Gian Chand, Branch Manager, the oriental Insurance company, who produced the record pertaining to claim file vide policy No.231203/31/2014/7550, vehicle No.CH-04L-9689 in the name of M/S Innovative Group (P) Ltd. He stated that as per record, M/S Innovative Group lodged claim with them on 16.10.2014, which is Ex.R-9. Thereafter, insured filed Motor claim which is Ex.R-10. The company deputed Kiran Kumar surveyor and loss assessor to assess the loss of vehicle in question, who submitted his survey report dated 18.4.2015, which 6 M/S Innovative Group Vs Jagdish & ors. is Ex.R-11. As per report, the net assessed loss is Rs.1,22,119/-. The driving licence of driver of said vehicle No.CH-04L-9689 was got verified and found fake. The copy of verification issued by SDO Siliguri is Ex.R-12. Copy of letter of Advocate Mihir Kumar Basu is Ex.R-13. Since the driver was having fake driving licence, so the company repudiated the claim and informed the insured through letter dated 5.6.2015, which is Ex.R-14. Thereafter, learned counsel for respondent no.3 closed the evidence. 12.I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the file. My issue wise findings are as under:- Issues No.1 & 2 13. For proving the rash and negligent act of respondent no. 1 the claimant has examined Lakhbir Singh driver of Canter no. CH04L-9689 who categorically stated that the accident had taken place due to sole negligence of Respondent no. 1, however criminal case was registered against him. The claimant has produced on record copy of Judgment delivered in criminal case Ex. P-9 whereby Lakhbir Singh was acquitted. Admittedly, respondent no. 2 filed a claim petition against Lakhbir singh and innovative group present claimant which was dismissed vide judgment Ex. P-10 wherein it was observed that the accident in question did not occur due to rash 7 M/S Innovative Group Vs Jagdish & ors. and negligent driving of canter bearing registration no. CH04L- 9689. It is well settled that the negligence under Section 166 is to be proved on the touch stone of evidence lead by the parties and technicalities should not be looked into while deciding a claim petition under MV Act. In present case the claimant had appeared before this court and attributed the negligence of respondent no. 1 whereas none of the witness or the driver stepped into the witness box to prove otherwise. An FIR is not lodged on solemn affirmations and the same cannot be a substitute for the evidence giving exhaustive version of the accident on solemn affirmation before the Tribunal. FIR is often lodged in a haste and the same cannot be a substitute for the evidence giving exhaustive version of the occurrence. The statement before the Tribunal is made on solemn affirmation, whereas the FIR is never lodged on solemn affirmation. Mere registration of an FIR cannot prove ipso facto the negligence of a person rather it is to be proved by leading evidence. No doubt the FIR was registered against the driver of the claimant but no adverse inference can be drawn from this fact. Accordingly, it is held that the accident had occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 and thereby caused damage to the canter of claimant. 14. With regard to quantum of compensation, RW-1 Gian 8 M/S Innovative Group Vs Jagdish & ors. Chand stated that net assessed is Rs.1,22,119/-, which was assessed by their surveyor and assessor vide report Ex.R-11. The evidence led by respondent no.3 can be relied upon in as much as it was insurer of the canter who conducted the survey and assessed the loss to the tune of Rs.1,22,119/-. The claimant has not challenged the aforesaid report till date. Hence, in view this, the claimant is held entitled to get compensation of Rs.1,22,119/- for the damage occurred to canter. Therefore, an amount of Rs.1,22,119/- adjudged as compensation to be paid to the claimant by the respondents. The liability of all the respondents to pay the adjudged compensation to the claimant will be joint and several. These issues are decided accordingly. Issue No. 3 15. The respondents have placed on record attested copy of route permit Ex.R-5, attested copy of DL Ex.R-6, attested copy of site plan Ex.R-7 and attested copy of mechanical report Ex.R-8 and as such, it is held that the trolla truck was being plied while having valid documents. Accordingly, this issue is decided against respondent no.3 and in favour of respondent No.1. Relief 16. In view of discussion made above, claim petition is 9 M/S Innovative Group Vs Jagdish & ors. allowed and the claimant is held entitled to get compensation of 1,22,119/- for the loss caused to the canter belonging to claimant.₹ The claimant shall further be entitled to interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of claim petition, in case the payment is made within three months from the date of award, the claimant will be entitled to interest at the rate of 8% per annum from the date of claim petition till payment. The respondents shall be jointly and severally liable to pay the Award amount. Counsel fee is assessed at Rs.3000/-. Memo of cost be prepared. File be consigned to record room.

His statement was recorded by the police, where he recorded the correct number of the offending vehicle. The motorcycle and car No.CH-01-AN-1423 5 Phool Chand Vs. Gurjant Singh & ors. were mechanically examined by the police on 27.2.2015. 7.

Learned counsel for respondent no.3 tendered copy of insurance policy Ex.R1 and closed the evidence. 10. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the file. My issue wise findings are as under:- Issues No.1 & 3 11. In order to prove that the accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 while driving the offending vehicle, there is a statement of PW-3 Phool Chand being injured, who stated that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1, who drove his car bearing registration no.CH-01AN-1423 rashly and negligently, which came at fast speed from their left side and struck against their motorcycle. 7 Phool Chand Vs. Gurjant Singh & ors. The accident took place on 24.2.2015 due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 1. Claimant received multiple injuries and he produced on record his medical record of Fortis Hospital Ex.P-1 and Ex.P-2, Disability certificate Ex.P-3, medical bills Ex.P-4 and Ex.P-5, pension record Ex.P-6, copy of aadhar card Ex.P-7, copy of his statement recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C by the police Ex.P-8, copy of FIR Ex.P-9, copy of statement of Sudesh Kumar Ex.P-10, release order of car bearing No.CH-01-AN-1423 Ex.P-11, mechanical reports of accidental vehicles Ex.P-12 and Ex.P-13. 12. The learned counsel for the respondents argued that in the FIR, complainant Sudesh Kumar mentioned the number of offending vehicle as PB-65R-1550 but in the present claim petition the number of offending vehicle is mentioned as CH-01-AN-1423, therefore, claimant is not entitled to compensation from the respondents as the accident was caused by the vehicle the number of which was mentioned in the FIR. 13. In order to prove the fact that the accident was caused by the driver of vehicle No.CH-01-AN-1423, the claimant produced on record the copy of statement of Sudesh Kumar Ex.P- 10, statement of Phool Chand Ex.P-8, release warrants Ex.P-11, 8 Phool Chand Vs. Gurjant Singh & ors. mechanical report Ex.P-12, wherein the vehicle number is correctly mentioned as CH-01-AN-1423. During his cross examination, claimant stated that as two vehicles were present at the spot, so his brother might have confused but he has mentioned the correct number of offending vehicle in his statement. The aforesaid vehicle was released on supardari vide Ex.P-11. The investigation has been conducted against the driver of offending vehicle. Being so, it is concluded that the vehicle bearing registration No.CH-01-AN-1423 was involved in the accident. This view finds support from the decision of the Hon'ble High Court in case titled as The New India Assurance company Vs. Smt. Brijh Sharma and others FAO No.3972 of 2012, wherein the Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court held that in a civil forum the witness who witnessed the occurrence can depose before the Court and establish independently the involvement of the vehicle and rash and negligent driving exhibited by the driver thereof, but in the claim petition, the Tribunal has independently assessed the evidence set in by the claimant and come to the conclusion that the accident took place only on account of rash and negligent driving of the vehicle. I am also supported by the decision of Hon'ble High Court in case titled as Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Smt. Anita Devi & ors FAO No.5482 of 2012. 9 Phool Chand Vs. Gurjant Singh & ors. 14. The evidence led by claimant could not be shattered during cross examination. Accordingly, it is held that the accident had occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 and thereby caused injuries to the claimant. 15. With regard to quantum of compensation, the claimant himself stated that he spent about Rs.80,000/- on his medical treatment but his entire medical expenditure was borne by the Fortis Hospital, Mohali and Command Hospital as he was ex- serviceman. He further stated that he had spent Rs.20,000/- on his special diet and Rs.10,000/- on transportation. He was 64 years of age at the time of accident. He was retired Subedar from Indian Army and was getting monthly pension of Rs.25,000/- approximately. He remained on bed for about four months. Thus, keeping in view the circumstances of the case, the claimant is entitled to claim a lumpsum amount of Rs.30,000/- for pain and suffering, special diet and transportation.

He did not file reply to the claim petition and was proceeded against ex parte vide order dated 5.1.2016. Respondent no. 3 contested the claim of the claimant interalia pleaded that the scooterist bearing no. CH 01 AP 9367 was not having driving licence at the time of accident. The owner/respondent no.2 has not given any information regarding the accident to respondent and as such insurance company is not liable to indemnify the owner qua the accident. The scooter which was insured by the respondent company involved in the accident was being used in contraventions of the terms and conditions of the insurance policy.

I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the file. My issue wise findings are as under:- Issues No.1 and 2 8. These issues are taken up together being interconnected. To prove that the accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 1 while driving the offending vehicle, there is a statement of 3 Ruliya Ram Vs. Sandeep Mittal CW1 Ruliya Ram being injured, who stated that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 who drove his Activa Honda bearing registration no. CH-01-AP-9367 rashly and negligently, came from behind and struck against his bicycle. The accident took place on 10.4.2014 due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 1. He received multiple injuries. He was taken to GMCH, Sector-32, Chandigarh. The claimant lodged FIR against respondent no.1, copy of which has been proved as Ex. PW2/1 by PW-2 HC Dharminder Singh. CW3 Dr. Brahmpreet Singh, Senior Resident, GMCH-32, Chandigarh stated that patient Ruliya Ram was admitted in hospital on 10.4.2014 and discharged on 22.4.2014. The patient got injured in road side accident and was operated for intratrochantric fracture on right side for which open reduction and internal fixation was done with long TFM proximal femoral nail. He produced discharge slip Ex.C-3 and certified copy of medical legal case summary Ex.CW3/1. 9. The testimony of witnesses examined by claimant could not be shattered during their cross examination. Indisputably, the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No 1. FIR was recorded by the police. The respondents have not led any evidence to rebut evidence of the claimants. In this way, statements of claimant witness remained un-rebutted which prove that the accident was caused due to the rash and negligent act of respondent No. 1. In case, Girdhari Lal vs Radhey Shyam and others V ol. CIV-(1993-2), The Punjab Law Reporter Page 109, it was held by our own Hon'ble High Court that driver was being tried on account of rash and negligent driving, prima facie safe to conclude that the accident occurred on account of rash and negligent driving of the driver. In the instant case also, the FIR has been registered against the respondent No 1. 4 Ruliya Ram Vs. Sandeep Mittal Accordingly, it is held that the accident had occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 and thereby caused injuries to the claimant. 10. With regard to quantum of compensation, the claimant has produced on record medical bills with regard to his treatment which are Ex C-4 to Ex. C-6 amounting to Rs.7144/-. Thus the claimant is entitled to claim the aforesaid amount. CW-2 Dr. Brahampreet Singh has proved the documents Ex C-3 and Ex CW3/1. The claimant received grievous injuries on his person. Being so, the claimant is entitled to recover Rs.25,000/- on account of pain and suffering. Therefore, an amount of Rs.32,144 /- adjudged as compensation to be paid to the claimant by the respondents. The liability of all the respondents to pay the adjudged compensation to the claimant will be joint and several. These issues are decided accordingly. Issue no.3 11. Onus to prove this issue was upon the respondent no.1 but respondent no.1 did not appear and was proceeded against ex parte. Thus, it is held that the respondent no.1 was not having valid driving license to drive Activa Honda in question. However, Activa Honda bearing No.CH-01-AP- 9367 was insured with respondent no.3, for which respondent insurance company is liable to pay amount of compensation as agitated above. Therefore, at the first instance the insurance company will pay the amount of compensation to the claimant but respondent no.3 will have the right to recover the amount from the respondents no.1 and 2.

Navdeep Arora Advocate, counsel for petitioner Sh. R.K. Vashishat Advocate, counsel for respondent no.1 Ms. Swatantar Kapoor Advocate, counsel for respondent no.2 A W A R D Case of petitioner is that on 04.03.2015, petitioner along with his nephew Sunil Kumar was walking on the left side of the road near # Roopam Singh/MACT/11.04.2016 1 of 10 Bhuvneswar Versus Rohtash 1363-C EWS Flats, Dhanas, UT, Chandigarh. At about 07:00 am, when they reached near the wall of Government School, EWS Flats, Dhanas, Chandigarh, a motorcycle bearing registration no.CH-04-J-0973 (hereinafter referred to as 'offending vehicle') being driven by respondent no.1 Rohtash in a rash & negligent manner and on the wrong side of the road, came from opposite direction and struck against the petitioner. Due to the impact, petitioner fell down on the road and sustained serious injuries. He was removed to GMSH-16, Chandigarh from where he was referred to PGI Chandigarh. Petitioner has sought compensation of 30 ₹ lacs on account of multiple grievous injuries sustained by him, in this accident. 2.FIR no.102 under sections 279&337 Indian Penal Code was registered on 08.03.2015 at Police Station Sector 11, Chandigarh against respondent no.1. 3.In his written statement, respondent no.1 i.e. driver-cum- owner of offending vehicle admitted the happening of accident however, attributed negligence on the part of petitioner. 4.On the other hand, respondent no.2-Insurance company filed written statement denying the very factum of accident having taken place in the manner stated. It is stated that respondent no.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident. Usual defences provided under section 134(c), 147, 149, 157, 158(6) & 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act were also pressed. 5.On the basis of pleadings of the parties, following issues Roopam Singh/MACT/11.04.2016 2 of 10 Bhuvneswar Versus Rohtash were framed on 01.12.2015:- (1)Whether accident dated 04.03.2015, resulting in injuries to Bhuvneshwar Parsad, occurred on account of rash and negligent driving of vehicle no.CH-04-J- 0793 by respondent no.1?OPP (2)Whether the petitioner is entitled for compensation for the injuries suffered by him, if so, to what extent?OPR (3)Whether the driver of offending vehicle was not holding a valid & effective driving licence on the date of accident and the vehicle was being driven in violation of terms and conditions of the insurance policy?OPR2 (4)Relief 6.To prove his case, petitioner stepped in the witness box as PW-1 whereas examined Dr. Ravi Kumar Preenja, Assistant Professor, Department of Orthopedics & Member Disability Board, GMCH 32, Chandigarh. On the hand hand, respondent no.1 appeared as RW-1. 7.I have heard learned counsel for both the parties. My issue- wise findings are as under:- ISSUE No.(1) 8.Petitioner-injured as PW-1 has testified that accident in question took place, when respondent no.1 drove the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. Similar fact is also incorporated in FIR Ex.P-1. 9.Though, factum of accident is admitted by respondents no.1 yet, negligence is attributed on the part of the petitioner. It is worthwhile to mention here that while appearing as RW1, respondent no.1 admitted during cross-examination that he was facing the criminal trial qua this Roopam Singh/MACT/11.04.2016 3 of 10 Bhuvneswar Versus Rohtash accident. In Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Shyam and others ; (1993-2) Punjab Law Reporter 109 (P&H), it has been held that where the driver is facing criminal trial for causing the accident, it is always safe to conclude that he was negligent, which squarely covers the situation in hand. 10.It is true that there is delay of four days in lodging of FIR however, this fact cannot be lost sight that since petitioner had received grievous injuries, neither he nor his family members could be expected to act mechanically with promptitude in getting the FIR lodged. Human nature and family responsibilities occupy the mind of kith and kin to such and extent that they give more importance to get the victim treated rather than rushing to Police Station. Only requirement in a case of delay is that courts are required to examine the evidence with closer scrutiny. If, court finds that there is no indication of fabrication or that it has not been concocted to engineered to implicate innocent persons than, claim petition cannot be dismissed on the ground that there is delay in lodging of FIR. 11.There is no reason to doubt the version of petitioner-injured. Petitioner had no reason whatsoever to implicate an innocent person. I n FIR Ex.P-1, there is mention that intimation regarding accident in question had reached at Police Post Dhanas through wireless set on 04.03.2015, where after it came out that PCR had removed the injured to GMSH-16, Chandigarh. Then, on second page of Discharge and Follow Up Card Ex.P-5, it is mentioned that there was alleged history of road side accident on 04.03.2015. These two facts have further lend credence to the testimony of petitioner. It is relevant to note here that police had also Roopam Singh/MACT/11.04.2016 4 of 10 Bhuvneswar Versus Rohtash investigated the case and after thorough investigation submitted the charge sheet against respondent no.1 in the court. There is nothing on record to make out that there was deliberate delay in lodging of FIR. In the circumstances , slight delay in lodging of FIR cannot be ground to deny justice to the injured. 12.In view of above discussed oral as well as documentary evidence on the record coupled with the legal position detailed above, it is held that accident resulting into injuries to petitioner took place due to rash and negligent driving of Motorcycle bearing registration no.CH-04-J- 0793 by respondent no.1. This issue is accordingly returned in favour of petitioner. ISSUE No.(2) 13.A perusal of Discharge and Follow Up Card Ex.P-5 would reveal that petitioner was admitted in PGI, Chandigarh on 06.03.2015 where he remained hospitalized till 03.04.2015. On second page of Ex.P- 5, it is mentioned that there was alleged history of road side accident on 04.03.2015. Also, in FIR Ex.P-1 there is mention that accident in question took place on 04.03.2015. As per Discharge and Follow Up Cards Ex.P-4 and Ex.P-3, the petitioner again remained admitted in PGI, Chandigarh from 14.09.2015 to 19.09.2015 and 13.11.2015 onwards respectively. It is recorded in documents in medical treatment that on 26.03.2015, surgery was performed on the petitioner when Open Reduction Internal Nailing was done and Angle Blade Plate was inserted. On 17.09.2015, petitioner was again operated qua Deb+C/S. Further on 17.11.2015, debridement Roopam Singh/MACT/11.04.2016 5 of 10 Bhuvneswar Versus Rohtash and implant was removed. In this way, till 17.11.2015 i.e. for more than five months after the accident, petitioner was being operated upon. A perusal of the bills Ex.P-8 to Ex.P-74 and Ex.P-76 reveals that during treatment, petitioner purchased medicines worth 43,569/-. Aforesaid ₹ bills and receipts being commensurate with the treatment record placed on record, there is no reason to doubt their authenticity. 14.As per Ex.P-6 i.e. copy of certificate issued by Education Department, State of Bihar date of birth of petitioner is 04.03.1955. In his medical record also, age of petitioner is described as 60 years. Meaning thereby that at the time of accident, petitioner was 60 years old. There being nothing contrary on record, age of petitioner at the time of accident is proved to be 60 years , for the purpose of this claim petition. 15.Petitioner has claimed that he being Maison used to earn 10,000/- per month however, i₹ n the absence of any cogent and convincing evidence, his monthly income cannot be assessed as claimed. Fact remains that being male member of the family, petitioner must be doing something to earn livelihood for himself and his family. In the absence of evidence that petitioner is a skilled labour, he is to be treated as an unskilled labour. 16.As per the revised rate assessed by Labour Department, UT, Chandigarh minimum wages for an unskilled labour were 7,940/- per ₹ month w.e.f. 01.10.2014. In such situation, it will be just and proper if, income of petitioner is assessed at ₹7,940/- or say 8,000/- per month i.e. ₹ at par with minimum wages for an unskilled labour in the area of Roopam Singh/MACT/11.04.2016 6 of 10 Bhuvneswar Versus Rohtash Chandigarh, during March 2015. Needless to say that nothing has been brought on record to justify more than this. 17.Learned counsel has contended that petitioner remained confined to bed for a period of one year, due to the injuries suffered by him in the accident in question. Having undergone three operations, the petitioner might have taken this much time for recuperation, during which he certainly suffered loss of income. By a fair estimate, he could not pursue his avocation for a period of twelve months. Considering the income of petitioner as 8,000/-per month, as observed earlier, 96,000/- ₹ ₹ (8,000X12) is assessed as his actual loss of income. 18.PW-2 Dr. Ravi Kumar Preenja has proved Disability Certificate Ex.P-75, according to which injured-petitioner was found permanent physically disabled to the extent of 70% in relation to both lower limbs. This witness further testified that due to this disability, which is functional, he will have difficulty in stair climbing, squatting and even in walking without support. Petitioner-injured being male member has to earn to support his family and his functional disability will also affect his job. Meaning thereby that he will not be able to perform the of job unskilled labour. Certainly, earning capacity of petitioner has been lowered. Having been considered a labour, petitioner-injured will certainly face hardship in performing his duties and earning his livelihood, due to the disability suffered by him. As such, loss of his earning capacity is assessed at 100%, for the purpose of present petition. 19.Annual income of petitioner has been calculated as 96,000/- ₹ Roopam Singh/MACT/11.04.2016 7 of 10 Bhuvneswar Versus Rohtash (8,000X12). Multiplier to be applied in the instant case wou ld be '9', age of injured being 60 years, at the time of accident in question. No provision for increase in the income of petitioner is being made, he being 60 years old at the time of accident. In this way future loss of income of the petitioner is calculated as 8,64,000/- (96,000X9). ₹ 20.This is case of permanent disability, for which petitioner has to be compensated. Compensation for loss of earning power/capacity has to be determined based on various aspects including permanent injury/disability. Apart from the fact that the permanent disability affects the earning capacity of the person, who has been injured in a motor vehicular accident and sustained permanent disability due to amputation of leg or hand, he has to forgo personal comforts and even for normal avocation has to depend on others, qua which he has to be compensated. The petitioner has suffered physical disability to the extent of 70% qua both the lower limbs, which is functional, he be unskilled labour. Due to above said disability, he will certainly face difficulty to perform his day to day activities, therefore, he is held entitled to a sum of 1,00,000/- on ₹ account of permanent physical disability suffered by him in the accident in question. 21.During the period of convalescence, petitioner must have taken special diet. He might have visited various hospitals for his follow up treatment and spent money on conveyance. His relatives must have been visiting him during the period of hospitalization and recuperation. An attendant is also supposed to have remained on duty to look after him. Roopam Singh/MACT/11.04.2016 8 of 10 Bhuvneswar Versus Rohtash Though, these incidental expenses have not been proved yet, the same can be reasonably estimated in the region of 50,000/-. ₹ 22.From the medical/treatment record, it is apparent that petitioner had remained under treatment for about one year, during which he must have suffered pain and agony. Due to the injuries, petitioner must have been deprived of amenities of life and has to go through same ordeal in future as well. Keeping in mind the nature of injury and period of treatment, to my mind, compensation to the tune of ₹1,00,000/- will be sufficient for this purpose. The calculation of compensation will be as follows: a)Expenses incurred on medical treatment 43,569₹ /- b)Actual loss of income 96,000₹ /- c)Loss of future earning 8,64,000₹ /- d)Permanent physical disability 1,00,000/-₹ e)Incidental expenses including diet and transportation 50,000/-₹ f)Pain & agony and deprivation of amenity of life 1,00,000/-₹ g)Total amount of compensation 12,53,569/-₹ Issue stands decided in favour of petitioner. ISSUE NO.(3) 23. Admittedly, offending vehicle was insured with respondent no.2. Although, a plea was taken that there was violation of the terms and conditions of the policy in as much as the driver of the offending vehicle was not having effective driving licence yet during arguments, this issue was not pressed. Even otherwise, no evidence has been brought on record to prove that vehicle in question was being driven in violation of the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and if it so, its effect on the case of Roopam Singh/MACT/11.04.2016 9 of 10 Bhuvneswar Versus Rohtash petitioner. Therefore, respondent no.1 being driver-cum-owner is liable to make the payment of the awarded amount, whereas respondent no.2 being insurer is liable to indemnify the insured i.e. respondent no.1. In these terms, issue is answered against the insurance company. RELIEF 24.As a sequel to the above findings, the captioned petition is allowed with costs. An award of 12,53,569/- or 12,53,600/-₹ ₹ (Twelve Lacs Fifty Three Thousand Six Hundred only) is passed. Petitioner is also held entitled to interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization. 25.75% shall be released to the petitioner whereas remaining 25% shall be invested in the shape of FDR in a nationalized Bank for a period of three years. The amount shall be paid to him on the date of maturity, without further orders by this Tribunal. 26.Counsel fee is assessed at 500/-. Memo of costs be ₹ prepared.

Amit & ors. petition, Claimant No.1 herself stepped into the witness box as PW.1 and examined Sunil Kumar, eye witness PW.2. Thereafter, counsel for the claimants closed the evidence. 8.On the other hand, respondent No.1 Amit himself stepped into witness box as RW-1. Thereafter, learned counsel for the respondents No.1 and 2 closed the evidence. The learned counsel for respondent no.3 tendered into evidence insurance policy Ex.R-3 and closed the evidence. 9.I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and also gone through the record. My issue-wise findings are as under : Issue No.1 10.In order to prove this issue, the claimant Lalita Devi PW- 1 tendered her affidavit PW1/A reiterating therein the averments of the claim petition. She also placed on record postmortem report of deceased Ex.P1, identity proofs of deceased and claimants Ex. P2 to Ex P9, FIR Ex. P10. PW2 Sunil Kumar tendered his affidavit Ex. PW2/A and stated the manner whereby the accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. This witness was examined again after the amendment of the petition wherein he stated that the accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving motorcylce bearing no.CH- 04B-6208. When cross examined, he stated that the police official has disclosed the number of vehicle to him. He had seen the occurrence. He 5 Lalita Devi & ors. Vs. Amit & ors. denied that he was not present at the spot. 11.Respondent no.1 Amit stepped into witness box and tendered his affidavit Ex.RW1/A stating that alleged accident took place after crossing Khuda Lahora bridge at about 7.50 PM on 10.4.2015. The accident took place due to sudden coming of Neel Gayan on the way from the jungle side and the said Neel Gayan firstly hit his motorcycle and then in the cycle of deceased, due to which both of them fell on the road and received multiple injuries. They were taken to PGI by PCR vehicle. He also placed on record the copy of insurance policy Ex.R- 1 and his driving licence Ex.R-2. When cross examined by learned counsel for respondent no.3, he has stated that on 10.4.2015, he was driving motorcycle at normal speed of 40 KM/hour. He had narrated the matter to the police regarding the manner of accident but they had not recorded his statement and falsely implicate him in the case on the basis of false and fabricated story. He has further stated that Sunil Kumar was not present at the spot. When cross examined by learned counsel for the claimant, he stated that criminal case was registered against him in relation to the accident for causing death of Dhodhay Mahto @ Doray. He had made not made report to the higher authority that the false case was registered against him. There was no enmity between him and deceased and that of his family. 12.Learned counsel for the respondent no.3 has contended that from the statement of PW2 Sunil kumar it emerges that the 6 Lalita Devi & ors. Vs. Amit & ors. registration number of the motorcycle was disclosed to him by police officials and his presence at the spot is not established. Therefore, the respondent no.1 can not be held to be negligent in driving the motorcycle. 13.On the other hand, learned counsel for claimants contended that respondent no. 1 has admitted the factum of accident but only denied the manner thereof. While elaborating his arguments, he contended that the accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1, who was driving the said motorcycle rashly and negligently. 14.From perusal of copy of FIR Ex.P-10, it is clear that criminal case was registered against the respondent No.1 under Sections 279, 337 and 304A IPC. In case, Girdhari Lal vs Radhey Shyam and others V ol. CIV-(1993-2), The Punjab Law Reporter Page 109, it was held by our own Hon'ble High Court that driver was being tried on account of rash and negligent driving, prima facie safe to conclude that the accident occurred on account of rash and negligent driving of the driver. In the instant case also, the FIR has been registered against the respondent No 1. Accordingly, it is held that the accident had occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 and thereby caused death of Dhodhay Mahto. The postmortem report of the deceased is placed on record and as per postmortem report Ex.P-1, the cause of death was craniocerebral damage consequent to blunt trauma to head. 7 Lalita Devi & ors. Vs. Amit & ors. 15.It is, thus, clear that respondent No.1 was driving the offending motorcycle in rash and negligent manner and due to his rash and negligent driving he hit his motorcycle against the deceased, which resulted in causing the injuries to the deceased, which proved fatal for the deceased. It is, therefore, held that deceased died in the accident which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of the offending motorcycle by respondent No.1. This issue is decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. Issue No.2. 16. Claimant Lalita Devi is the wife of the deceased Dhodhay Mahota, who in her affidavit Exhibit PW1/A stated that the deceased met with an accident on 10.4.2015 and died due to the injuries sustained in the said accident. He was 41 years of age at the time of accident. He was sole bread earner of the family. He was doing marble grinding work and was earning Rs.10,000/- per month. He used to give a sum of Rs.8000/- per month to her for household expenses. Claimant no.2, elder son of deceased is handicapped. All the claimants have suffered irreparable loss due to untimely death of deceased as they all were dependent on the income of the deceased. Now they have no source of income as the deceased was only earning member of the family. In her cross-examination, she stated that she has not brought any proof regarding the income of the deceased as Rs.10,000/- per month. She denied the suggestion that the deceased was spending Rs.5000/- on his 8 Lalita Devi & ors. Vs. Amit & ors. personal expenses. 17. There is no documentary evidence regarding the income of the deceased. Faced with this situation, learned counsel for the claimants has argued that the income being earned by a daily wager be taken as income of the deceased. Now a days, a labourer must be getting 7000/- per month. As such, the monthly income of the deceased is held₹ to be 7,000/- per month. ₹ 18. As per postmortem report Ex.P-1, the deceased was 45 years of age at the time of his death. In aadhar card Ex.P-2 the date of birth of deceased is mentioned as 1.1.1969. Therefore, in view of the judgment Smt. Sarla Verma and others vs Delhi Transport Corporation and another , 2009(6) SCC 121, multiplier of 14 is applicable. 1/5th of the income is liable to be deducted as personal expenses of the deceased. 19. In the case of Rajesh and another v. Rajbir Singh 2013(3) RCR(Civil) 170, , the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that a sum of 1.00 lac be awarded to claimant no.1 as compensation for loss ₹ of consortium, another sum of 25,000/- for funeral and last rites and for ₹ love and affection children i.e. claimants no.2 to 5 and 8 shall be awarded Rs.30,000/- each. Accordingly, the compensation is assessed as under:- 9 Lalita Devi & ors. Vs. Amit & ors. Sr.No. Heads Calculation 1.Monthly Income Rs.7000/- per month 2. Annual income Rs.7000x12=Rs.84,000/- per annum. 3. 30% increase of annual income for future prospects.Rs.84000+25200= 1,09,200/- 4. 1/5th of annual income deducted towards personal expenses of the deceased. Rs.21840/- (1,09,200-21840)= Rs.87360 5. Compensation after multiplier of 14 is applied. Rs.87360x14=12,23,040/- 6. Loss of consortium Rs.1 lac 7. Loss of love and affection to the children i.e. claimants no.2 to 5 and 7. Rs.30,000/-each (30,000X5=1,50,000/- 8.Funeral expenses Rs.25,000/- 9. Total compensation awarded Rs.14,98,040/- 20. Accordingly, the claimants are held entitled to get compensation of 14,98,040/-. ₹ This issue to the above extent is decided in favour of claimants and against the respondents. Issue No.3. 21. The onus to prove this issue was on respondent No.3, which has not brought any evidence that respondent No.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence to drive the offending vehicle as on the date of accident. However, the driving licence of respondent No.1 is placed on record as Ex.R-2. As such, it is held that the respondent No.1 was having valid driving licence at the time of accident. This issue is, therefore, decided against respondent No.3 and in favour of respondents No.1. 10 Lalita Devi & ors. Vs. Amit & ors. Issue No.4 (Relief). 22. In view of findings on above issues, the claim petition is allowed with costs and an Award for Rs.14,98,040/- (Thirteen lacs ninety eight thousand and fourty) only, is passed in favour of claimant No.1 (wife) to the extent of - 30% and remaining amount of compensation shall be given to the claimants No.2 to 8 in equal share. The claimants shall further be entitled to interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of claim petition, in case the payment is made within three months from the date of award.

They both were going to Grain Market, Sector 26, Chandigarh and when they reached near the speed breaker on the middle road of Golf Club, Chandigarh, a Fire Brigade Van bearing registration no.CH-01-G-1-0132 driven by respondent no.1 in a very negligent manner, came at a very high speed, without blowing horn, struck into the vehicle driven by the deceased in a straight way. The motorcyclist along with Ranjit Singh fell on the road along with motorcycle. They both received multiple and grievous injuries. The driver of the said Van came down and told his name as Ramesh Kumar. They both were taken to hospital in Sector 16, Chandigarh from where they were referred to PGI Chandigarh. Rahul was declared as brought dead. However, Ranjit was under treatment 3 Urmila & Ors. Vs Ramesh Kumar & Ors. as he had also received multiple and grievous injuries. The accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle bearing no. CH-01-G1-0132 driven by respondent no.1. There is no fault of any kind on the part of deceased as they were going towards Sector 26 Grain Market in a smooth manner by following traffic guidelines in his own side. FIR no.56 dated 1.2.2015 was lodged by the police of Police Station Sector 26, Chandigarh against respondent no.1. 3The deceased was 20 years old at the time of accident, working in Catering business and also doing job in Grain Market Sector 26, Chandigarh on daily basis and further on part time basis. He was self employed and also worked with M/s Rajinder Singh & Sons, 292, Sector 26, Chandigarh on regular basis and further on part time basis.

A sum of Rs.50 lacs along with interest @ 18% p.a has been claimed as compensation on account of death of Rahul. 4In response to notice, the respondents appeared. The respondent no.1 filed written statement taking preliminary objections regarding maintainability, cause of action & collusion etc. It is alleged that deceased himself was negligent. The amount claimed is highly excessive, exorbitant and without any basis. The respondent relies upon defence u/s 147, 149, 158(6) and other provisions. The respondent crave leave u/s 170 of the Act to all the defence. If court comes to conclusion that accident took place, then contributory negligence cannot be ruled out. 4 Urmila & Ors. Vs Ramesh Kumar & Ors. 5While replying on merits, it is submitted that it is specifically denied that the deceased was having monthly income of Rs.25,000/-. It is submitted that the vehicle which is alleged to be involved in the alleged accident belongs to the Fire Department of M.C. Chandigarh with the office of Fire Brigade, Municipal Corporation, Sector 17, Chandigarh and all the record pertaining to the same is available with the office/department only. The claimants have miserably failed to apprise this Tribunal regarding the alleged accident which might have taken place due to their own negligence. The claimants have also not put on record any driving license of the deceased and have also failed to show the valid insurance of the motorcycle allegedly involved in the accident. In any case, of the alleged accident, the said truck was fully insured with respondent no.3 and the liability if any that may arise is of the insurance company. 6While taking additional pleas, it is submitted that the accident may have taken place due to negligence of deceased himself and respondent has no role in that. Moreover, the claim petition is filed with an ulterior motive to extort money from the answering respondent. Therefore, the claim petition may be dismissed with costs. 7Respondent no.2 filed written statement taking preliminary objections regarding maintainability & cause of action. It is submitted that the answering respondent is not liable to pay any amount of compensation to the claimant in case there is any collusion between the insured and the claimant or the insured did not plead and contest the case on merits. The 5 Urmila & Ors. Vs Ramesh Kumar & Ors. answering respondent craves leave to take all the defences available u/s 170 of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 to the insured in case at any stage of this case if it appears that there is any sort of collusion between the claimant and the insured/respondent no.1 willfully abstain from the proceeding of the case and thereby fail to contest the claim on merits. The answering respondent is not liable to pay any amount of compensation to the claimant in case the deceased himself was negligent. The answering respondent is not liable to pay any amount of compensation to the claimant in case it is proved that the complainant himself was negligent and was solely responsible for the alleged incident. Without prejudice to the other rights of the answering respondent, the amount claimed is highly excessive, exorbitant and without any basis. A fraudulent claim petition has been filed with a view to defraud the answering respondent. The claim petition is bogus, malafide and illegal and the same is liable to be dismissed. The answering respondent relies upon all the defences and conditions provided u/s 147, 149, 158(6) and all other relevant provisions of the Act and the policy in question. If this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that any incident took place, the contributory negligence may not be ruled out. 8While replying on merits, it is specifically denied that the deceased was having monthly income of Rs.25,000/-. The claimants be put to strict proof with regard to age, resident and income of the deceased. The Fire Brigade Van bearing registration no.CH-01-G1-0132 is fully insured with M/s Oriental Insurance Company vide policy no.231203/31/2015/9121. The claimants have miserably failed to apprise this Tribunal regarding the alleged accident which might have taken place due to their own negligence. 6 Urmila & Ors. Vs Ramesh Kumar & Ors. The claimants have also not put on record any driving license of the deceased and have also failed to show the valid insurance of the motorcycle allegedly involved in the said accident. The claim petition so filed by the claimants is liable to be set aside qua the answering respondent i.e. respondent no.2. In any case, of the alleged accident, the said truck was fully insured with the respondent no.3. It is denied that the alleged accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the driver of Fire Brigade Van. Therefore, the present claim petition may be dismissed in the interest of justice. 9Respondent no.3 filed separate written statement taking preliminary objections therein that the claim petition is vague, incomplete and does not disclose any cause of action against the answering respondent. On this ground only, the claim petition is liable to be dismissed. The answering respondent reserves its right to amend the pleading if new facts come to light during the pendency of the present claim petition. The answering respondent takes up all the defences available u/s 147, 149, 157, 170 of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988. No such accident took place of the alleged vehicle no.CH-01-G1-0132, so the claim petition is not maintainable and the same is liable to be dismissed. The respondent no.1/driver of the alleged offending vehicle at the time of accident was not holding a valid & effective driving license to drive that vehicle and was not driving the said vehicle at that time and respondent no.2 was having knowledge of the same and was not having valid RC, fitness certificate, route permit & insurance policy. In that case the answering respondent is not liable to indemnify the owner even if the claimant proves to get any compensation. 7 Urmila & Ors. Vs Ramesh Kumar & Ors. 10While replying on merits, the alleged accident which took place on 31.1.15 is denied. It is submitted that the claimants are bound to prove not only the accident as alleged but also the allegation that it was caused by the driver of the alleged vehicle by his rash & negligent driving. No information regarding the accident has been received by the answering respondent from the insured/respondent no.2 as per terms & conditions of the insurance policy. It is further submitted that the amount claimed of Rs.50 lacs is highly exaggerated, abnormal and without any equitable basis, even if the claimants prove to get any compensation. Moreover, no required details of basis of compensation claimed at an imaginary figure of Rs.50 lacs have been mentioned, therefore, it merits dismissal only. Therefore, the claim petition may be dismissed against the answering respondent with heavy costs. 11From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed:- 1 Whether accident dated 31.1.2015 resulting in death of Rahul occurred on account of rash and negligent driving of vehicle no.CH-01-G1-0132 by respondent no.1? OPP. 2 Whether the claimants are entitled to compensation for death of Rahul, if so, to what extent and from whom? OPP. 3 Whether the driver of offending vehicle was not holding a valid & effective driving license on the date of accident and the vehicle was being driven in violation of terms and conditions of the insurance policy? OPR3. 4 Relief. 12To substantiate their respective claims the parties led their 8 Urmila & Ors. Vs Ramesh Kumar & Ors. evidence. 13The claimants have examined as many as three witnesses in all. The claimant no.1 Urmila herself stepped into the witness box as PW1. Deepak, who was eye witness was examined as PW-2. Narinder Pal Singh, Prop. Of M/s Rajinder Singh and Sons was examined as PW-3. Documents Ex P-1 to Ex P-7 and Ex PW3/1 to Ex PW3/2 were tendered in evidence. Thereafter, the evidence of the claimants was closed. 14On the other hand, no oral evidence was led by the respondents. However, documents Ex R-1 to Ex R-4 were tendered in evidence and evidence of respondents was closed. 15No rebuttal evidence was adduced by the claimants. 16The learned counsels for both the parties were heard. The issue wise findings with reasons thereof are as follows : ISSUE No. 1: 17To substantiate this issue, the learned counsel for the petitioner argued that from the statement of PW-2 Deepak, who was eye witness, the accident by way of rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and the death of deceased Rahul are well proved. The oral testimony of witness is further supported by the documentary evidence also. The copy of PMR is on the record as Ex.P5 and the copy of FIR is on the record is Ex.P7. The 9 Urmila & Ors. Vs Ramesh Kumar & Ors. respondent no. 1 is facing criminal trial for rash and negligent driving. In this way, the accident due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 1 and the death of Rahul in the accident are well proved. 18The learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand opposed the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the claimants. The learned counsel for respondent no.1 argued that the claimants failed to prove the accident by way of rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 1 and the death of Rahul in the alleged accident by way of evidence adduced by the claimants. The ld. counsel for respondent no.2 argued on the same lines as that of respondent no.1. The learned counsel for respondent no.3 further argued that the statement of PW2 can not be relied upon as he is the friend of the deceased. The version given by the witness is concocted. He is a projected witness and he can not be relied upon. The lodging of FIR and the production of the challan against the accused in a criminal trial are not sufficient to prove the rash and negligent driving. In this way, the claimant failed to prove the accident and death of Rahul by way of accident. 19 The arguments advanced by learned counsel for both the sides are duly considered apart from perusing the record. PW-2 Deepak, who is eye witness has well deposed in his statement that on 31.1.2015, he went to Grain Market, Sector 26, Chandigarh on his motorcycle bearing no. CH-01- AM-5446 and his friends Rahul & Ranjit were also going on their motorcycle no.CH-01-AZ-6255 and they were ahead of him. When they reached on the road of Golf Club at about 8 pm on 31.1.15 and when the motorcycle driven by Rahul reached in the middle of speed breakers, then a 10 Urmila & Ors. Vs Ramesh Kumar & Ors. vehicle of Fire Brigade bearing no.CH-01-G1-0132 driven by Ramesh Kumar son of Satpal in a very rash and negligent driving and without blowing horn came from the opposite side of Grain Market and struck his vehicle into the motorcycle of Rahul. Due to the impact, Rahul along with Ranjit fell on the road and received multiple injuries on vital parts of their body. The accident was seen by him as he was also driving his motorcycle behind the motorcycle of Rahul. They both were taken to hospital by the police. Due to the multiple injuries sustained by Rahul, he expired. The post mortem as conducted by the hospital authorities and an FIR Ex P-7 was lodged at Police Station Sector 26, Chandigarh on his statement. Nothing otherwise could be extracted during his cross-examination. From his statement, rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 1 and the death of Rahul in the accident are well proved. He can not be disbelieved merely on the ground that he was friend of the deceased as his confidence could not be shaken during the cross-examination. His statement is corroborated by documentary evidence also. The copy of PMR is on the record as Ex.P5 and the copy of FIR is on the record as Ex.P7. These documents are very strong corroborative piece of evidence. The statement of PW-2 corroborated by these documents, is sufficient to prove the rash and negligent driving, accident and death of Rahul in the accident. Apart from that the accident and rash and negligent driving is to be proved beyond reasonable doubt in criminal trial only. In the civil matters, like claim petitions, the accident and rash and negligent can be proved with the help of preponderance of probabilities also. Reliance in this regard can be given of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in case titled as Kusum Lata and 11 Urmila & Ors. Vs Ramesh Kumar & Ors. others Vs. Satbir and others, 2011(4) LJR 512. 20 In view of above discussion, issue no. 1 is hereby decided in favour of claimants. ISSUE NO. 2 : 21 To substantiate this issue, the learned counsel for the claimants argued that the deceased was 20 years old and was working in Catering business besides his job in Grain Market, Sector 26, Chandigarh with M/s Rajinder Singh and Sons, 292, Sector 26, Chandigarh. Besides that the deceased was also doing part time job and from all sources, his earning was more than Rs.25,000/- per month. The claimants no.2 and 3 are real sisters of the deceased and claimant no.4 is the real brother of the deceased. The father of the deceased has already expired prior to his demise. To prove his income, the claimants have examined Narinder Pal Singh, Proprietor of M/s Rajinder Singh and Sons and dealing in Karyana business in wholesale and retain basis from his business place i.e. SCF no.292, Sector 26, Grain Market, Chandigarh. This witness stated that the deceased Rahul was drawing salary of Rs.10,000/- from the said concern. He also stated that the deceased was also doing part time catering business from which he was also drawing handsome income and as such, from all sources, he was earning more than Rs.25,000/- per month. The ld. counsel submitted that the compensation be assessed accordingly. The claimants are entitled for 50% increase in the income of deceased as future prospectus. In support of his 12 Urmila & Ors. Vs Ramesh Kumar & Ors. arguments, the ld. counsel relied upon the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case titled as Munna Lal Jain and another vs. Vipin Kumar Sharma and others 2015 AIR (SCW) 3105 . The compensation may be assessed accordingly. 22The learned counsel for respondents, on the other hand, opposed the arguments. It is argued by ld. counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 that claimants have failed to prove the income of the deceased by way of evidence, therefore, the claimants are not entitled for any claim. 23The learned counsel for respondent no.3 argued that income of the deceased is not well established, therefore, claimants are not entitled for any compensation. If this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that compensation is to be paid, then it is alleged that multiplier is to be applied in view of the age of parents of the deceased and not in view of the age of deceased. In support of his arguments, he relied upon the law laid down by three Judges Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case titled as New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Shanti Pathak and Others 2007 ACJ 2188. The ld. Counsel further submitted that in case of self employed, the claimants are not entitled for future prospects. In support of his arguments, the ld. Counsel relied upon the law laid down by Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in a case titled as Smt. Savita and ors. vs. Satpal and ors. FAO no.2417 of 2013 (O&M) decided on 21.9.2015. The ld. Counsel submitted that the Hon'ble High Court has observed that the case law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Munna 13 Urmila & Ors. Vs Ramesh Kumar & Ors. Lal Jain and another vs. Vipin Kumar Sharma and others 2015 AIR (SCW) 3105 and Rajesh and ors. vs. Rajbir Singh and others 2013(9) SCC 54 have been referred to larger bench. The ld. Counsel submitted that the Hon'ble High Court has observed that if the divergent view is received from the Hon'ble Supreme Court, it will not be possible for the insurance company to make recovery. The ld. Counsel submitted that in such circumstances, the future prospectus may not be granted. 24The learned counsel for the claimants rebutted the arguments of the ld. Counsel for the respondent no.3. It is argued that the multiplier is to be applied as per the age of the deceased and not as per the age of claimants. It is also alleged that the claimants are entitled for 50% as future prospects. In support of his arguments, the ld. Counsel again relied upon the law laid down by three Judges bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as Munna Lal Jain and another vs. Vipin Kumar Sharma and others 2015 ACJ 1985. The ld. Counsel submitted that the said law may have been referred to the larger bench, but the said law has not been set aside till date. It is a good law till date, therefore, it can be relied upon. As such, the claimants are not entitled for any claim. 25 The arguments advanced by ld counsel for both the side are duly considered part from perusing the record. As far as age of the deceased is concerned, the age is alleged to be 20 years by the claimants in the evidence. As per post mortem report Ex P-5, also the age is 20 years. As such, the age of the deceased is taken 20 years at the time of accident. 14 Urmila & Ors. Vs Ramesh Kumar & Ors. 26 As far as the income of the deceased is concerned, the ld. Counsel for the claimants has claimed the income of deceased as Rs.25,000/- i.e. Rs.10,000/- from salary and Rs.15000/- from catering business. PW-3 Narinder Pal Singh, Proprietor of M/s Rajinder Singh stated that income of deceased is Rs.10,000/- per month supported by document Ex PW3/2. From the perusal of these documents as well as oral statement of PW-3 Narinder Pal Singh, it is well established that the deceased was drawing salary of Rs.10,000/- p.m. As far as the business of catering is concerned, apart from oral testimony of PW-1, PW-2 and PW-3, there is no other documentary evidence on the record to support their version that the deceased was having a catering business and he was earning Rs.15,000/- per month by way of catering business. In such circumstances, the income from the catering business is not proved. In this way, income of the deceased is proved to the tune of Rs.10,000/- per month only. The annual income of the deceased comes to Rs.1,20,000/-. As far as deduction is concerned, the deceased was bachelor, therefore deduction should be 1/2. In such circumstances, the income for the purpose of compensation comes to the tune of Rs.60,000/-/- per annum. 27As far as multiplier is concerned, the ld. counsel for respondent no.3 has pressed that multiplier should be applied as per the age of parents and in this regard, he relied upon the law laid down by three Judges bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Shanti Pathak and Others 2007 ACJ 2188 . 15 Urmila & Ors. Vs Ramesh Kumar & Ors. 28On the other hand, the ld. counsel for the claimants is also relying upon the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as Munna Lal Jain and another vs. Vipin Kumar Sharma and others 2015 ACJ 1985 which is also three Judges bench decision. The judgment produced by ld. counsel for the respondent no.3 was passed in the year of 2007 while the judgment produced by ld. counsel for the claimants was passed in the year of 2015, therefore, the judgment produced by ld. counsel for the claimants will be applicable on the facts & circumstances of the present case. 29As far as future prospects is concerned, while again relying upon Munna Lal Jain's case (supra), the ld. counsel for the claimants has pressed for future prospects and while relying upon the law laid down by Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in Savita & Others' case (supra), the ld. counsel for respondent no.3 is pressing for future prospects cannot be granted in case of self employed. In this regard, this Tribunal is of the view that in view of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Munna Lal Jain's case (supra), the claimants are entitled for future prospects. The said law may have been referred to the larger bench, but the said law has not been set aside till date. It is a good law till date, therefore, it can be relied upon. 30Apart from above, the deceased was getting salary of Rs.10,000/- per month, though the salary was being paid by a private concern, yet he was getting salary, therefore, he is to be considered a salaried person and not self employed. On this ground also, the claimants are 16 Urmila & Ors. Vs Ramesh Kumar & Ors. entitled for future prospects and the law laid down by Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in Savita & Others' case (supra) is not applicable on the facts & circumstances of the present case. 30The deceased was 20 years old at the time of accident, therefore, the multiplier of 18 is to be applied in view of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as Smt. Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Anr., 2009(3) RCR (Civil), 77. In this way, the amount of claim comes to the tune of Rs.60,000x18 = Rs.10,80,000/-. As far as future prospects is concerned, the claimants are entitled for the future prospects @ 50%. Therefore, considering 50% income as future prospects, the future income of the deceased comes to Rs.5,40,000/-. Apart from that, claimants are entitled to Rs.50,000/- each as loss of love and affection and claimants are further entitled to Rs.25,000/- as funeral expenses. In this way, the claimants are entitled for Rs.10,80,000/- + Rs.5,40,000/- + Rs.2,00,000/- (Rs.50000+Rs.50000+50000+50000) + Rs.25,000/- = Rs.18,45,000/-. The claimants are also entitled for interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the realization of the whole of this amount. 31 The liability to make the payment is joint and several of all the respondents. However, the insurance company i.e. respondent no. 3 is required to make the payment as vehicle in question was insured one vide insurance policy Ex R- 4 and respondent no. 3 is bound to indemnify the respondent no 2, registered owner of the vehicle in question. 17 Urmila & Ors. Vs Ramesh Kumar & Ors. 32 In view of above discussion, issue no. 2 is decided in favour of claimants. ISSUE NO. 3 : 33This issue was not specifically pressed at the time of arguments. However, otherwise also the copy of driving license of respondent no.1 has been placed on record as Ex.R-3. Therefore, this issue is decided against the respondent no.3. RELIEF: 34 In view of above discussion, it is held that the claimants are entitled for compensation and an award of Rs.18,45,000/- (Rs. Eighteen Lacs Forty Five thousand only) is hereby passed in favour of claimants and against the respondents no.1 to 3 jointly & severally along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the realization of the whole of this amount. However, the insurance company is required to make the payment as vehicle in question was insured one.

Another sum of Rs.20,000/- was spent on transportation charges.

It is further alleged that the claim application has been filed in contravention of the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The claimants are not entitled to any compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act or the law of Torts as the claimants have not suffered any monetary loss. The driver of Mahindra Varito bearing registration No.PB-11BB-6904 was not holding a valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident, as such the answering respondent is not liable to pay any Neelam Goyal & ors vs. Sandeep Kumar & ors. compensation.

OPP. 2 Whether the claimants are entitled to compensation on Neelam Goyal & ors vs. Sandeep Kumar & ors. account of death of Diwan Chand Goel, if so, to what extent and from whom?

OPR-1 4 Relief. 8.To substantiate their respective claims the parties led their evidence. 9.The claimants examined one witness in all. The claimant no.1 Neelam Goyal herself stepped into the witness box as CW-1. Documents Ex CW1/A1 to CW1/A4 were tendered in evidence. Thereafter, the claimants closed their evidence. 10On the other hand, no evidence was lead on behalf of respondent despite giving sufficient opportunity, thereafter, evidence of the respondents was closed by order. An application for additional evidence was moved by the claimants but the same was dismissed on 23.1.2017. 11.Neither any rebuttal evidence was made out nor adduced by the claimants. 12.The learned counsels for both the parties were heard. The issue wise findings with reasons thereof are as follows : Neelam Goyal & ors vs. Sandeep Kumar & ors. ISSUE No. 1: 13.To substantiate this issue, learned counsel for the claimants argued that accident dated 27.2.2014 resulting in the death of Dewan Chand Goyal has occurred on account of rash and negligent driving of vehicle No.PB-11-BB6904 driven by respondent No.2. The rash and negligent driving of respondent No.2 is very much proved from the evidence adduced by the claimants. The wife of the deceased Neelam Goyal has appeared as CW1. Apart from that DDR as regard to the accident is on record as Ex.CW1/A and the postmortem report of the deceased is on record as Ex.CW1/A2. From these documents and the statement of the witness it is well established that the accident has taken place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.2 and deceased Dewan Chand Goyal has expired in the accident. 14.Learned counsel for respondent No.1 on the other hand opposed the arguments and it is stated that the accident due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.2 is not proved. However, if this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the accident due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.2 is proved, then the vehicle in question is insured with respondent No.3 and respondent No.3 is liable to pay the compensation. 15.Learned counsel for the respondent No.3 argued that Neelam Goyal & ors vs. Sandeep Kumar & ors. from the evidence adduced by the claimants, the rash and negligent driving of respondent No.2 is not proved. CW1 Neelam Goyal was not a eye witness to the accident, therefore, her statement is not sufficient to prove the rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. There is no other evidence on record to prove rash and negligent driving of respondent No.2. It is not made out from Ex.CW1/A that respondent No.2 was driving the vehicle rashly and negligently. Hence, the claimants failed to prove the rash and negligent driving of respondent No.2 by way of evidence. 16.The arguments advanced by learned counsel for both the sides are duly considered apart from perusing the record. The onus to prove rash and negligent driving of respondent No.2 was on the claimants. Only one witness i.e. Neelam Goyal wife of deceased Dewan Chand Goyal was examined as CW1. She was not an eye witness of the accident, therefore, rash and negligent of respondent No.2 is not proved from her statement. As far as DDR Ex.CW1/A1 is concerned it is not made out from the perusal of the said DDR that the vehicle was being driven rashly and negligently by respondent No.2 driver of the vehicle. In such circumstances, the rash and negligent driving of respondent No.2 is not proved. However, from the DDR the accident of the alleged vehicle No.Pb-11-BB-6904 is well proved and from the postmortem report Ex.CW1/A2 corroborated from the statement of CW1 it is established that Neelam Goyal & ors vs. Sandeep Kumar & ors. Sh.Dewan Chand Goyal has expired in the said accident but rash and negligent driving of respondent No.2 is not established. 17. In view of the above discussion issue No.2 is hereby decided against the claimants. ISSUE No.2 18.Ld.counsel for the claimants argued that the deceased was 52 years old at the time of his death. As per statement of CW1 deceased was earning Rs.70,000/- per month. The income tax return of the deceased is Ex.CW1/A4. As per that statement the deceased was having income of Rs.5,72,606/- for the assessment area of 2013- 14. After deducting income tax of Rs.29,759/-, the remaining amount is required to be taken as income of the deceased and the multiplier of 12 may be applied. Apart from that the claimants are entitled for compensation under the usual heads. In alternate it is argued that the claimants are entitled for the compensation under no fault liability also. 19.Learned counsel for respondents No.1 on the other hand alleged that the income is not proved, therefore, no compensation can be granted. 20.Learned counsel for respondent No.3 also opposed the arguments and alleged that as rash and negligent is not proved, Neelam Goyal & ors vs. Sandeep Kumar & ors. therefore, the claimants are not entitled for any compensation. It is further argued that as far as no fault liability u/s 140 of M.V .Act is concerned appropriate order may be passed. 21.The arguments advanced by learned counsel for both the sides are duly considered apart from perusing the record. As per detailed discussion in issue No.1 it has been held that the claimants have failed to prove the rash and negligent driving of respondent No.2, therefore, the liability to pay compensation is not established. However, it is well established on the record that deceased Dewan Chand Goyal has expired in the said accident, therefore, the claimants are entitled for no fault liability compensation of Rs.50,000/-. As far as the liability to pay compensation is concerned respondents No.1 & 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the same u/s 140 of M.V .Act for no fault liability. Moreover, the vehicle in question was insured, therefore, respondent No.3 Insurance Company is liable to pay the same as it is liable to indemnify the owner . 22. In view of the above discussion, issue No.2 is partly decided in favour of the claimants upto the extent of no fault liability only and partly issue is decided against the claimants. ISSUE NO. 3: 23.At the time of arguments it is not disputed that the Neelam Goyal & ors vs. Sandeep Kumar & ors. vehicle in question was insured with respondent No.3. As such this issue is decided in favour of respondent No.1. RELIEF: 24. It is held that the claimants is entitled to compensation to the tune of Rs.50,000/- as no fault liability and respondent No.2 is liable to pay the compensation to the claimants. The claimant No.1 being wife of Sh.Dewan Chand Goyal shall be entitled for the same. Claimants No.2 and 3 being major sons are not entitled for the compensation. The amount be deposited in the account of claimant No.1 on supply of bank account. Petition stands accordingly partly allowed. Memo of costs be prepared. File be consigned to the record room after due compliance. Pronounced in open Court: Jasbir Singh Sidhu Dated :02.02.2017. Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh.

PW-3 Dr. Love Kapoor, Senior Resident, Department of Orthopedics, GMCH-32, Chandigarh stated that Jodh Singh was examined by the Medical Board on the directions given by the Court. A Board was constituted and on examination, he was found to be a case of fracture D-7, D- 11 and D-12 of vertebra alongwith fracture left clavicle. On physical examination and after analysing the entire medical record, he was diagnosed as a treated case of fracture D-7, D-11 and D-12 with fracture left clavicle with stiffness left shoulder. This permanent physical disability is assessed as 19% in relation to whole body. The copy of disability certificate is Ex.P-17. Physiotherapy was recommended. 9. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents No.3 tendered into evidence copy of insurance policy Ex.R3/1, copy of judgment Ex.R3/2, copy of statement of PW-1 Ex.R3/3 and copy of statement of PW-2 Ex.R3/4 5 Jodh Singh vs Sukhdev Singh & others and closed the evidence. 10.I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the file. My issue wise findings are as under:- Issues No.1 & 2 11. Learned counsel for respondent No.3 Insurance company has contended that the claimant did not support his version in a criminal case and the respondent no.1 was acquitted of the charges vide judgement dated 23.11.2015, copy of which is Ex.R3/2. He has further contended that the claimant stated that he never met with an accident nor received injury and did not know the accused in the present case, therefore, no such accident took place with the Tavera car driven by respondent no.1, as such, the claimant is not entitled to seek any compensation. 12.On the other hand, learned counsel for claimant has contended that the accident has been admitted by the respondent, insurance company. He has further contended that the driver has not stepped into witness box and the evidence of the claimant in a criminal case cannot be taken into consideration in this case as the Tribunal has to arrive at an independent conclusion after going through the evidence led by the claimant. He has further contended that the claimant is entitled to receive the compensation by way of composite 6 Jodh Singh vs Sukhdev Singh & others negligence being passenger in three wheeler. 13. I have considered the respective contentions of learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the record. 14. Indisputably, the accident has taken place between three wheeler and Tavera driven by respondent No.1. The claimant being passenger of three wheeler can claim the entire amount of compensation either of the joint tort feasors. This view finds support from the observations of Hon'ble Apex Court in case titled Khenyei Vs. New India Assurance Co. Ltd. & ors. 2015 (2) ACC (SC) 657, wherein it is held that the claimants are entitled to sue one of the joint tort-feasor for seeking compensation. The similar view has also been taken by the Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in FAO No.5235 of 2016 (O&M) case supra wherein while following the dictum in Khenyei's case supra it was observed as under:- “ Thus, it is very clear that even if the owner and driver of the other vehicle, that was involved in accident, were not impleaded as respondents in the claim petition, that would not debar the claimants from seeking compensation only from the owner driver and insurer of one of the vehicles involved, i.e. the bus, the owner and driver of tempo traveler that is stated to have also been involved in the accident not having been impleaded as respondents by the claimants.” 7 Jodh Singh vs Sukhdev Singh & others 15.Respondents no.1 and 2 did not appear to contest the present claim petition, therefore, they were proceeded ex parte. The factum of accident has been admitted by the respondent No.3. It is claimed that the accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of Asgar Mohd. driver of three wheeler. From perusal of record, it reveals that FIR Ex.P-1 was registered against respondent no.1 on the statement of Asgar Mohd. The testimony of claimant could not be shattered during his cross examination. The respondents have not led any evidence to rebut evidence of the claimants. In this way, statement of claimant remained un-rebutted which prove that the accident was caused due to the rash and negligent act of respondent No. 1. In case, Girdhari Lal vs. Radhey Shyam and others V ol. CIV-(1993-2), The Punjab Law Reporter Page 109, it was held by our own Hon'ble High Court that driver was being tried on account of rash and negligent driving, prima facie safe to conclude that the accident occurred on account of rash and negligent driving of the driver. In the instant case also, the FIR has been registered against the respondent No 1. Accordingly, it is held that the accident had occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 and thereby caused injuries to the claimant. 16. With regard to quantum of compensation, claimant examined PW-3 Dr. Love Kapoor, Senior Resident, Department of Orthopedics, GMCH- 32, Chandigarh, who stated that Jodh Singh was examined by the Medical Board and on physical examination and after analysing the entire medical 8 Jodh Singh vs Sukhdev Singh & others record, he was diagnosed as a treated case of fracture D-7, D-11 and D-12 with fracture left clavicle with stiffness left shoulder. This permanent physical disability is assessed as 19% in relation to whole body. The copy of disability certificate is Ex.P-17. 17. As per Ex.P-17, the permanent disability of the claimant has been assessed to the extent of 19% in relation to left upper limb and not qua his whole body and thus, the said 19% permanent disability, when taken for the whole body would stand reduced to the extent of 10%, keeping in view the nature of injury and all the factors effecting his earnings and result of the disability on his working capabilities. As per PW-3 Dr. Love Kapoor, who assessed and issued disability certificate Ex.P-17, it was a functional disability and because of the restriction of motion/movement of the left shoulder, the patient will have difficulty in doing activities above left shoulder/overhead activities. The patient will have chronic back pain because of fracture D-7, D- 11 and D-12. It was held in case titled Raj Kumar Vs. Ajay Kumar and another 2011 (1) SCC 344, by the Hon'ble High Court that :- “Where the claimant suffers a permanent disability as a result of injuries, the assessment of compensation under the head of loss of future earnings would depend upon the effect and impact of such permanent disability on his earning capacity. The Tribunal should not mechanically apply the percentage of permanent disability as the 9 Jodh Singh vs Sukhdev Singh & others percentage of economic loss or loss of earning capacity. What requires to be assessed by the Tribunal is the effect of permanent disability on the earning capacity of the injured; and after assessing the loss of earning capacity in terms of percentage of the income, it has to be quantified in terms of money, to arrive at the future loss of earnings (by applying the standard multiplier method used to determine loss of dependency.” Thus, the claimant is found entitled to compensation on account of suffering disability of 19%. The same being of left upper limb and spine would definitely have some effect on his daily functioning and in performing his work. However, while computing the loss, it is to be kept in mind that the same was not qua the complete body but qua the left upper limb and spine only to the extent of 19% and the same has been assessed at 10% in relation to the complete body. The loss of future income has to be calculated accordingly. The income of the claimant at the time of accident has been proved to be Rs.18,192/- as is evident and established from salary certificate Ex.P-13 produced on record by PW-2 Wazir Singh. The monthly future loss of income in view of the assessed liability of 10% comes to Rs.1819/- and the yearly loss comes to Rs.21,828/-. Keeping in view the age of the claimant, which is 53 years, the multiplier is to be adopted is 11 and future loss of earnings comes to Rs.2,40,108/-. However, for the remainder years of service i.e. five years, there would be no loss of income, as no evidence has come on record that the 10 Jodh Singh vs Sukhdev Singh & others claimant would suffer an income loss or reduction in salary and as such, the future loss of income is being calculated while applying multiplier of 9 only i.e. after deducting five years, the total loss of future income for which the claimant is held entitled is Rs.1,96,452/-. 18. From perusal of office order Ex.P-15, it is established that claimant availed total leave for 100 days which includes 70 days commuted leave on medical ground and 30 days earned leave. Per day leave of claimant comes to Rs.606, therefore, loss for 100 days leaves comes to Rs.60,600/-. T he claimant is entitled to recover Rs.10,000/- on account of pain and suffering and loss of amenities. Therefore, in total an amount of Rs.2,67,052/- adjudged as compensation to be paid to the claimant by the respondents. 19. In view of discussion above, the claimant is entitled to compensation of Rs.2,67,052/-. These issues are decided accordingly. Issue No.3 20. Onus to prove this issue was upon respondent no.1 but neither respondent no.1 put in appearance nor produced the copy of his driving licence, therefore, he was proceeded ex parte. Thus, it is held that the respondent no.1 was not having valid driving license to drive vehicle in question. However, his vehicle bearing No.CH-02-T-3070 was insured with respondent no.3, for which respondent insurance company is liable to pay 11 Jodh Singh vs Sukhdev Singh & others amount of compensation as agitated above. Therefore, at the first instance the insurance company will pay the amount of compensation to the claimant but respondent no.3 will have the right to recover the amount from the respondents no.1 and 2. This issue is decided accordingly. Relief 21. In view of discussion made above, claim petition is allowed and the claimant is held entitled to get compensation of Rs.2,67,052/- for the injuries suffered by him in the accident. The claimant shall further be entitled to interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of claim petition, in case the payment is made within three months from the date of award, the claimant will be entitled to interest at the rate of 8% per annum from the date of claim petition till payment. The respondents shall be jointly and severally liable to pay the Award amount. A t the first instance the insurance company will pay the amount of compensation to the claimant but respondent no.3 will have the right to recover the amount from the respondents no.1 and 2.

It was further contended that copy of first Information report, Exhibit P-2, which was lodged with respect to the accident in question further fortified plea of the applicants as regards factum and manner of the accident showing that respondent No. 1 was negligent in driving the offending vehicle, which resulted into the accident in which the deceased had lost his life. 13.On behalf of the respondents it was argued by learned counsel that factum and manner of occurrence remained unproved. The further contention of the learned counsel for the respondent No.1 was that no accident was caused by respondent No.1 but the name of respondent No.1 and vehicle in question had been falsely implicated in the case in hand. The argument on behalf of respondent No. 3 was that no accident with vehicle in question had taken place and that the vehicle had been falsely involved in the accident in question in connivance with respondent No. 1. 14.I have anxiously considered rival contentions of the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the record carefully. 15.As per case of the applicants and as deposed by PW-1 Subhash Kumar Yadav, injured and author of First Information Report, that on 06.03.2012, at about 09:30 am, he was going to Raipur Kalan by crossing AKM Brick-Kiln and he saw that one motor cycle Bullet in a rash and negligent manner and on side speed, came from Fatak of Vikas Nagar, Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. 6 Subhash Kumar Yadav and others vs. Shahnwaj and others Panchkula Barrier and hit a bi-cyclist; that when the witness went there and saw that bi-cyclist was his father; that the witness noted down the number of Bullet Motor-cycle as HR03-M-4402; that driver of Bullet Motor-cycle disclosed his name as Shahnwaj son of Mohd. Azim, resident of House No.1101, Vikas Nagar, Mauli Jagran, Chandigarh; that so many persons gathered at the spot and taking the advantage of situation, the driver ran away from the spot; that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 against whom FIR No.68 dated 07.03.2012 was registered. However, despite lengthy cross-examination, respondents could not impeach the credibility of PW-1 Subhash Kumar Yadav. Further, the contention of learned counsel for respondent no. 1 that respondent No. 1 had no concern with the accident as no accident took place, is not tenable as respondent No. 1 Shasanwaj (Shahnwaj) while appearing as RW-1 categorically admitted in his cross-examination that FIR was registered against him regarding the present accident in which he was arrested and lateron released on bail by the police. He had further admitted that he had not made any representation to higher authorities regarding his alleged false implication in this case. 16.Further, contents of First Information Report, copy of which is Exhibit-P-2, also corroborate the plea of the applicant as regards the factum and manner of occurrence. 17.Even otherwise, the Tribunal, in terms of Section 166 of the Act, is not required to hold a regular trial but, according to scheme of Act, it holds an enquiry for adjudication of claims for award of compensation in respect of accidents involving the death or bodily injury to persons, arising out of use of motor vehicles. The adjudication of claim in these proceedings has to be made Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. 7 Subhash Kumar Yadav and others vs. Shahnwaj and others on the preponderance of probabilities. The quality of evidence and not the quantity thereof, in totality of circumstances, clearly proves the involvement of the respondent no.1 and the offending vehicle bearing registration no. HR03-M-4402 for the accident in question. As per copy of postmortem report of deceased Exhibit P-1, the deceased had died in motor vehicular accident on 07.03.2012 at 01:00 AM. 18.In view of above discussion it is proved on record that respondent no.1 Shahnwaj caused the accident, while driving the offending vehicle belonging to him in a rash and negligent manner, resulting into death of the deceased. Therefore, this issue is decided in favour of the applicants and against the respondents. Issue No. 2: 19.Onus to prove this issue was upon the applicants who were required to prove that they were entitled to claim compensation and its extent as also liability of the respondents to pay the compensation. Applicants were required to show that they were entitled to claim compensation and its extent as also liability of all or either of the respondents to pay the amount of compensation. Before proceeding further, it may be added that Section 168 of the Act enjoins the Tribunal to make an award determining the amount of compensation which appears to be just. However, the objective factors, which may constitute the basis of compensation appearing as just, have not been indicated in the Act. Thus, the expression ‘which appears to be just, vests a wide discretion in the Tribunal in the matter of determination of compensation. Nevertheless, the wide amplitude of such power does not empower the Tribunal to determine the compensation arbitrarily, or to ignore Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. 8 Subhash Kumar Yadav and others vs. Shahnwaj and others the settled principles relating to determination of compensation. 20.Before taking up the discussion on the merits of the issue, the legal arguments raised on behalf of the respondents are taken up for discussion. 21.On behalf of the respondents legal point was raised that the claimants had already filed claim petition before Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Panchkula regarding the accident in question, therefore, the second claim petition in respect of the same accident was not maintainable. 22.The argument however is without any merit because the claimants have not suppressed any material fact and rather it was mentioned in the present claim petition that earlier claim petition was filed but the same was withdrawn. Certified copy of the order dated 07.08.2014 Exhibit RX has been placed on record from the perusal of which it is apparent that the earlier claim petition filed by the present claimants before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal at Panchkula was withdrawn and was not decided on merits. Therefore, the dismissal of the earlier claim petition by the present claimants does not have any effect on the present claim petition and the argument is accordingly repelled. 23.The argument on behalf of the learned counsel for the respondents was that all claimants were admittedly major and therefore, they could not be expected to be dependent on the income of the deceased and therefore, they were not entitled to claim any amount of compensation for the death of their father. 24.On the other hand, the argument on behalf of the claimants was that the claim petition could be preferred by the legal representatives and in Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. 9 Subhash Kumar Yadav and others vs. Shahnwaj and others support of the arguments reliance was placed on authority Montford Brothers of St. Gabriel vs. United India Insurance (SC) 2014 ACJ 667 . Learned counsel then contended that the deceased was jointly residing with the claimants and was contributing for running the household of the claimants and therefore, claimants were entitled to obtain compensation on account of death of their father Somnath. In authority Montford Brothers of St. Gabriel (supra) it was held that “in case of death of a person in a motor vehicle accident, right is available to a legal representative of the deceased or the agent of the legal representative to lodge a claim for compensation under the provisions of the Act. The issue as to who is a legal representative or its agent is basically an issue of fact and may be decided one way or the other dependent upon the facts of a particular case. But as a legal proposition it is undeniable that a person claiming to be a legal representative has the locus to maintain an application for compensation under Section 166 of the Act, either directly or through any agent, subject to result of a dispute raised by the other side on this issue”. The said authority is fully attracted to the facts of the present case and therefore, it can be safely concluded that the claim petition by the claimants who are sons of the deceased, is legally maintainable. 25.On the other hand, the argument of the learned counsel for the respondents was that the claimants being major sons of the deceased could not be said to have any dependency on the income of the deceased. The argument however is without merit in-as-much as it has to be decided as a matter of fact as to whether the claimants had any dependency on the deceased and the deceased was contributing anything for deciding the question of compensation, if any, to which the claimants are entitled. Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. 10 Subhash Kumar Yadav and others vs. Shahnwaj and others 26.On behalf of the claimants, we have the sworn testimony of PW.1 Subhash Kumar Yadav in which it was claimed that deceased Somnath was jointly residing with the claimants and their family in the same house and was contributing for running the household. However, on behalf of the respondents, except bald suggestions no evidence was led that deceased was not residing with the claimants or was not contributing anything for running the household of the claimants. Therefore, the claimants are certainly entitled to compensation on account of death of deceased who was making contribution from his income for running the household. 27.In this case, applicants claimed compensation amounting to 60,00,000/- on account of death of deceased Somnath in motor vehicular₹ accident. As stated by the applicants, the deceased was aged 60 years and was earning 15,000/- per month approximately. He was working as Meson. ₹ However, no authentic record regarding the persons i.e. contractor etc. from whom he had been receiving the same amount, was examined nor any bank record was placed in the judicial file regarding the monthly income of the claimant to the tune of 15,000/-. Therefore, he has to be treated as unskilled ₹ labourer. However, as per notification of Chandigarh Administration regarding minimum wages of unskilled labourer with effect from 01.10.2011 to 31.03.2012 was around 234/- per day and on that account the monthly ₹ income taking 25 working days comes to 5850/-. Therefore, the income of ₹ deceased is assessed as 5850/- per month. ₹ No contrary evidence has been led on behalf of respondents. Therefore, the income of Somnath, since deceased is assessed as 70,200/- per annum ( 5850/- x 12). ₹ ₹ 28.As regards age of the deceased, it is the case of the applicants Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. 11 Subhash Kumar Yadav and others vs. Shahnwaj and others that the deceased was aged 60 years. PW.1 Subhash Kumar Yadav deposed on oath that his father Somnath was aged 60 years at the time of accident. However, in the postmortem report copy Exhibit P1 and so also the applicants have given the age of the deceased as 60 years by approximation. In this view of the matter, the age of the deceased i.e. Somnath, at the time of accident, is assessed as 60 years. 29.Keeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case in hand, ½ income of the deceased is to be deducted for his personal expenses and he was expected to contribute ½ of his income for running the household by the claimants. Thus, net loss of dependency comes to 70,200/- minus ₹ 35,100/- = 35,100/- per annum.₹ ₹ 30.As the deceased was 60 years at the time of his death, in terms of Smt. Sarla Verma & others versus Delhi Transport Corporation & another (supra) multiplier of 9 needs to be applied. Thus, amount of compensation payable to the applicants No.1 to 3 comes to 3,15,900/- ₹ ( 35,100/- x 9). In view of law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India₹ in Rajesh & others Versus Rajbir Singh & others (supra) , amount of 25,000/- is awarded to applicants on account of funeral expenditure. Total₹ amount comes to 3,40,900/-. ₹ 31.As discussed above, offending vehicle was owned by respondent no.2 V .B. Singh Chauhan, which was being driven by respondent No.1 Shahnwaj Rajeev Kumar Rana, and as per copy of insurance policy of the offending vehicle, Exhibit RZ, the offending vehicle was insured with respondent no.3 at the time of the accident. 32.In these circumstances, all the respondents shall be jointly and Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. 12 Subhash Kumar Yadav and others vs. Shahnwaj and others severally liable to make payment of compensation to the applicants No.1 to 3. Thus, issue no.2 is decided in the aforesaid terms in favour of the applicants and against the respondents. Issue no. 3:- 33. Onus to prove this issue was upon respondent no.1. Photocopy of driving licence of respondent no.1 was placed on record as Exhibit R1/1 but no effort was made by respondent no.3 to prove that it was invalid or ineffective at the time of the accident. More so, from the perusal of Ex.R1/1, it transpires that the same was issued on 25.04.2008 and valid upto 24.04.2028 for M/Cycle/Scooter/Car/Jeep only. In the present case, accident took place on 06.03.2012, therefore, I hold that respondent No. 1 was holding a valid and effective driving license at the time of accident. Therefore, this issue is decided in favour of respondent no.1 and against respondent no.3. Relief: 34.As a result of the findings on above issues, compensation of 3,40,900/- (Rupees Three Lacs Forty Thousand Nine Hundred only) is₹ awarded in favour of applicants No. 1 to 3 in equal shares and against the respondents. They shall also be entitled to interest on the amount of compensation @ 7½% per annum from the date of application till realization. Applicants No. 1 to 3 shall also certify before this Tribunal the fact of receipt of amount of compensation within a period of one month of receipt of the amount. The amount of compensation shall be paid by respondent Nos. 1 to 3 jointly and severally. Claim application is accepted in the aforesaid manner with costs. The amount of compensation shall be inclusive of the amount of compensation payable under Section 140 of the Act and amount of Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. 13 Subhash Kumar Yadav and others vs. Shahnwaj and others compensation, if any, received by the applicants thereunder shall be adjusted against the amount of compensation hereby awarded.

Claim Petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act. ***** Present: Th. Kartar Singh, counsel for claimants. Sh.H.S. Ghuman, counsel for respondents no.1. Sh.Harminder Singh, counsel for respondent no.2. Sh.K.S. Bhangu, counsel for respondent no.3. 2 Durpati & Ors. Vs Vishal & Ors . A W A R D The claimants have filed the present claim petition under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act for seeking compensation to the tune of Rs.40 lacs on account of death of Dhananjay caused in a road side vehicular accident. 2 While providing the particulars as required under the Motor Vehicles Act and the Rules framed thereunder the claimants interalia alleged that on 24.2.2015, the deceased was going from Sector 38, Chandigarh to Sector 52, Chandigarh as pillion rider on motorcycle no.CH-01-AZ-9657 driven by respondent no.1 Vishal @ Shankar at a very high speed and in rash & negligent manner. When at about 1.40 a.m., they reached near small chowk of Sector 42/43, Chandigarh, in the meantime, the offending motorcycle suddenly developed mechanical defect and it being at high speed, went out of control and motorcycle skid against the foot path. As a result of that, the deceased suffered multiple injuries on vital organs of his body including head injury which proved fatal for him. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. 3The deceased was 20 years old at the time of accident, working as Carpenter and earning Rs.10,000/- per month. Police Station Sector 36, Chandigarh registered the case regarding the accident. The deceased suffered multiple injuries on vital organs of his body including head injury, as a result of that he died. Immediately after the accident, the deceased was shifted to Government Hospital Sector 16, Chandigarh from where he was referred to PGI, Chandigarh and was discharged on 7.3.2015, but his condition being 3 Durpati & Ors. Vs Vishal & Ors . deteriorated, he was again admitted in PGI hospital on 11.3.2013, however, despite best treatment given to him, he died on the same day. A sum of Rs.50,000/- has been spent on his treatment. Claimants no.1 and 2 are parents of the deceased, whereas claimants no.3 to 6 are younger brother and sisters of the deceased. The deceased was hale & hearty and was very efficient in his carpenter work. All the claimants were dependent upon the income of the deceased. The claimans are entitled for loss of love and affection, loss of estate and also for the expenses incurred upon last rites of the deceased. Rs.40 lacs along with interest @ 24% p.a from the date of filing the claim petition till realization has been claimed as compensation on account of death of the deceased. 4In response of the notice, the respondents appeared and contested the petition. Respondent no.1 filed written statement stating that the deceased was not riding as pillion rider on motorcycle no.CH-01-AZ- 9657. The motorcycle no.CH-01-AZ-9657 was not involved in the alleged accident. The claimants are not entitled for any compensation. The answering respondent never drove the vehicle in question, as such no question arises regarding driving in rash and negligent manner. Therefore, the claim petition of the claimants may be dismissed with costs, in the interest of justice. 5Respondent no.2 filed written statement controverting the contents of petition. It is stated that the amount claimed is highly exaggerated. Dismissal of the claim petition along with costs has been prayed for. 4 Durpati & Ors. Vs Vishal & Ors . 6Respondent no.3 filed written statement taking preliminary objections that no cause of action has arisen in favour of the claimants to file the present claim petition against the answering respondent. The claim petition is not maintainable. No criminal case regarding rash and negligent driving or causing of alleged accident by respondentno.1 or sustaining of alleged accidental injuries had been reported by the claimants to the police or to the answering respondent. Moreover, the claimants and respondent no.1 are in relation and it is alleged by the claimants that deceased was pillion rider of the motorcycle which respondent no.1 was allegedly driving. Thus, it cannot be presumed that respondent no.1 has caused alleged accident while driving cycle no.CH-01-AZ-9657 in rash and negligent manner on 24.2.2015 unless and until it is proved by the claimants beyond any doubt. In the absence of any criminal case or allegations, no negligence can be attributed against respondent no.1 as alleged by the claimants. 7The answering respondent takes up all the pleas available u/s 147, 149, 157 & 170 of the Motor Vehicle Act, in case it is proved that there is collusion between the claimants and other respondents no.1 and 2. Though the respondent no.3 denies the occurrence of any accident, yet for the argument sake, it is stated that no negligence has been alleged against respondent no.1. The respondent no.1 was not holding valid and effective driving license on the date of accident and as such, the respondents no.1 and 2 have violated the terms & conditions of the policy (if any as alleged by the claimant). Hence, no award can be fastened against the answering respondent. 5 Durpati & Ors. Vs Vishal & Ors . 8While replying on merits, it is submitted that in the absence of income tax return, income of the claimant cannot be assessed within the limits of income tax slab. The deceased has not met with any accident on 24.2.15 as alleged. The alleged accident was neither reported to police nor informed to the answering insurance company within reasonable time. The present petition is the outcome of after-thought story. No FIR in respect of the alleged accident is pending or registered in Police Station Sector 36, Chandigarh by the claimants within the reasonable time. No copy of MLR/PMR or doctor’s slip issued by the hospital has been provided by the claimants to the answering respondent. The claimants have not attracted any proof to substantiate their claim. The claimants are not entitled to any compensation as no alleged accident had taken place with the vehicle motorcycle no.CH-01-AZ-9657. The claimants and other respondents had failed to furnish copy of insurance policy and registration certificate of the vehicle motorcycle no.CH-01-AZ-9657 of the relevant time of alleged accident. In the absence of copy of insurance policy of the concerned period and registration certificate and verification of its contents, the accident and liability of the answering respondent are denied. 9The amount of Rs.40 lacs as claimed by the claimants is highly exaggerated and no details of the same has been given. No information from respondents no.1 or 2 regarding the occurrence of accident has been received as per the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. In case if it is proved that the occurrence took place, then the claimants be put on strict proof of the fact that alleged accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving 6 Durpati & Ors. Vs Vishal & Ors . of the respondent no.1 while driving motorcycle no.CH-01-AZ-9657. From the facts and circumstances of the case, it is prima facie proved that no accident as alleged by the claimants had occurred with the said motorcycle as no FIR has been registered against the respondent no.1 at Police Station Sector 36, Chandigarh regarding rash and negligent driving of the vehicle, in whose jurisdiction the accident alleged to be occurred. Therefore, the claim petition of the claimants be dismissed as against the answering respondent no.3. 9From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed:- 1 Whether accident dated 24.2.2015 resulting in death of Dhananjay, occurred on account of rash and negligent driving of vehicle no. CH-01-AZ-9657 by respondent no.1? OPP. 2 Whether the claimants are entitled to compensation for death of Dhananjay, if so, to what extent and from whom? OPP. 3 Whether the driver of offending vehicle was not holding a valid & effective driving license on the date of accident and the vehicle was being driven in violation of terms and conditions of the insurance policy? OPR3. 4 Relief. 10To substantiate their respective claims the parties led their evidence. 11The claimants have examined one witness in all. The claimant no.2 himself appeared as PW-1. Documents Ex P-1 to Ex P-5 were tendered in evidence. Thereafter, the evidence of the claimants was closed. 7 Durpati & Ors. Vs Vishal & Ors . 12On the other hand, the respondents examined three witnesses in all. SI Avtar Singh was examined as RW-1. Respondent no.1 Vishal @ Shankar himself appeared as RW-2. Pardeep s/o Rohan Lal was examined as RW-3. Documents Ex R-1 to Ex R-19 were tendered in evidence documents. Thereafter, evidence was closed by all the respondents. 13No rebuttal evidence was adduced by the claimants. 14The learned counsels for both the parties were heard. The issue wise findings with reasons thereof are as follows : ISSUE No. 1: 15To substantiate this issue, the ld. counsel for the claimants argued that the accident by way of rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 is well proved from the statement of PW-1 Shayam Dev who was the eye witness of the accident. He has well deposed that on 24.2.2015, he was going from Sector 38, Chandigarh to Sector 52, Chandigarh. At about 1.40 a.m., when he reached near chowk of Sector 42/43, Chandigarh, he saw his son going as pillion rider on motorcycle no.CH-01-AZ-9657 driven by respondent no.1 at very high speed rashly & negligently. When they reached near small chowk of Sector 42/43, Chandigarh, in the meantime, the motorcycle suddenly developed mechanical defect and it being in high speed went out of control and skid against the foothpath. As a result of that, Dhananjay suffered multiple injuries on vital organs of his body who was taken to hospital. He was discharged on 7.3.2015, but he had to be admitted 8 Durpati & Ors. Vs Vishal & Ors . in PGI again on 11.3.2015 where he expired. The DDR as regard to accident was also lodged which is on the record as Ex P-1. The DDR as regard to death of Dhananjay is Ex P-2 and another DDR as regard to proceedings u/s 174 Cr.P.C is on the record as Ex P-3. The post-mortem is on the record as Ex P-4. In this way, from the evidence adduced by the claimant oral as well as documentary, the accident is well proved. 16The learned counsels for respondents no.1 and 2, on the other hand, opposed the arguments advanced by the ld. counsel for claimants. It is argued that the accident and rash & negligent driving of respondent no.1 is not proved by way of evidence adduced by the claimant. No eye witness has been examined by the claimant. The said Shayam Dev is the father of the deceased and he is not an eye witness. This fact is clear from the fact that the police personnels have taken the deceased to the hospital, PW-1 was not accompanying them. Had he been present on the spot, then he must have accompanied the injured who later on has expired. Apart from that, the witness has suffered statement before the police during the inquiry on the basis of DDR which is on the record as Ex R-8. In that statement, he deposed that on that day, he was present at his house and the friend of his son whose name is not known to him came there and told about the accident of his son. On that information, he went to PGI where he came to know that the said accident has taken place as the motorcycle has suddenly gone out of control. The ld. counsel submitted that from this statement, it is well made out that he was not present at the spot at the time of accident. 17The next contention of the learned counsel is that the said 9 Durpati & Ors. Vs Vishal & Ors . Vishal has himself appeared into the witness box as RW-2 and stated that no accident had taken place, therefore, the accident is not proved. Apart from that, Pardeep, another occupant of the motorcycle has also appeared as RW- 3. He has deposed that at the time of accident, the motorcycle was driven by the deceased Dhananjay himself and it was not Vishal who was driving the motorcycle. In such circumstances, neither the accident nor the rash and negligent driving of Vishal is proved. 18The learned counsel for respondent no.3 argued that the accident is not proved from the evidence adduced by the claimant. PW-1 Shayam Dev is not the eye witness of the accident. The ld. Counsel further argued that if this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that any accident had taken place, even then respondent no.3 is not liable. The ld. Counsel stated that at the time of accident, three persons were riding on the motorcycle which is against the terms & conditions of the insurance policy, therefore, there is no liability of respondent no.3. In alternate, it is contributory liability. Further, the alleged driver of the motorcycle Vishal was not having any driving license. Moreover, all the three riders were under the influence of liquor which is clear from their MLRs which are on the record. Ex R-15 is the MLR of Vishal, Ex R-17 is the MLR of Pardeep and Ex R-11 is the MLR of Dhananjay. On this ground also, the insurance company is not liable. Hence the petition may be dismissed against the answering respondent. 19The learned counsel for the claimants rebutted the arguments of ld. Counsel for the respondents. It is argued that merely on the ground that there were two pillion riders on the motorcycle, it cannot be said that the 10 Durpati & Ors. Vs Vishal & Ors . motorcyclist was responsible for contributory negligence. In support of his arguments, the ld. Counsel relied upon the law laid down by Hon’ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in the case titled as Iffco Tokio General Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs Akbari and others 2015 ACJ 2515 . 20The next contention of the ld. Counsel is that there is overwhelming evidence on the record to establish that Vishal was driving the motorcycle. PW-1 who is eye witness has well deposed that the motorcycle was being driven by Vishal. In the statement Ex R-6 suffered before the police, Vishal admitted that he was driving the motorcycle. While appearing in the court as RW-2 also, he admitted in his cross-examination that he was driving the motorcycle. Pardeep, the another rider of the motorcycle also admitted in his statement Ex R-7 before the police that Vishal was driving the motorcycle. In this way, the rash and negligent driving of Vishal, the accident and the death of Dhananjay due to accident are well proved. 21The arguments advanced by the learned counsels for both the sides are duly considered apart from perusing the record. It was for the claimans to prove that the motorcycle in question was being driven rashly and negligently by respondent no.1 and due to his rash and negligent driving, the accident has taken place in which Dhananjay has expired. For that purpose, the claimant is mainly relying upon the statement of PW-1 Shayam Dev who is stated to be eye witness and the other documents like DDR and PMR etc. The respondents have raised the question mark on the presence of PW-1 at the spot and it is alleged that he is a projected witness only and he was not present at the spot at the time of accident. To prove that 11 Durpati & Ors. Vs Vishal & Ors . fact, it is pointed out on behalf of respondent that Shayam Dev had suffered a statement Ex R-8 before the police also on 24.2.2015 to the effect that he was at house at that time and the friend of his son informed him regarding the accident and that the accident has taken place as suddenly the motorcycle went out of control. At this juncture, the ld. Counsel for the claimant has again alleged that this statement cannot be relied upon as it was not suffered by Shayam Dev. Moreover, the date is written as 24.1.15 at point-C in the statement while the accident had occurred on 24.2.15. In this regard, this Tribunal is of the view that the alleged date at point-C appears to be a clerical mistake because in the side of the document on left hand side, the date is properly written as 24.2.15. The other documents i.e. Ex R-6 and Ex R-7 also bears the date as 24.2.15. In this way, this date is made out as 24.2.15 and from this statement, it is made out that Shayam Dev was not present at the spot. Apart from that if he was present at the spot, then he must have went to the hospital along with injured, but the injured was taken to the hospital by the police personnel which further shows that he was not present at the spot. As such, this witness cannot be relied upon. Apart from that, the Investigating person SI Avtar Singh has also been examined as RW- 1. In his cross-examination, the said witness has disclosed that as per his investigation, nobody was responsible for causing the accident and the accident was not caused due to rash and negligent driving by anybody. From all these facts & circumstances, it is made out that the accident has not taken place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and he is not responsible for the death of Dhananjay, therefore, no liability is made out. 22It was also the defence of the respondents no.1 and 2 that Vishal 12 Durpati & Ors. Vs Vishal & Ors . was not driving the motorcycle at the time of accident, but they failed to prove the said fact as Vishal admitted in his cross-examination that he was driving the motorcycle. He has admitted this fact before the police also and Pardeep has also admitted the same fact before the police. The statement of Vishal before the police is on record as Ex R-6 and that of Pardeep as Ex R-7. From all the said facts & circumstances, it is made out that Vishal was driving the motorcycle, but due to the reasons as already mentioned, it is not made out that the accident has taken place due to his rash and negligent driving, therefore, he was not responsible for the accident. As rash and negligent driving is not proved, therefore, there is no question of contributory negligence. The law relied upon by the ld. counsel for the claimant in Iffco Tokio General Insurance Co. Ltd.'s case (supra) is not applicable to the facts & circumstances of the present case. 23In view of above discussion, this issue is decided against the claimants/petitioners. ISSUE No.:2: 24In view of discussion on issue no.1, it is held that the claimants have failed to prove that the accident dated 24.2.15 resulting in death of Dhananjay occurred on account of rash and negligent driving of vehicle/motorcycle no.CH-01-AZ-9657 by respondent no.1, therefore, they are not entitled for any compensation. Hence, this issue is decided against the claimants. 13 Durpati & Ors. Vs Vishal & Ors . ISSUE No.:3: 25No driving license could be produced on record by respondents no.1 and 2 in respect of Vishal who was allegedly driving the motorcycle. Therefore, it can be said that the driver was not having a valid & effective driving license. In such circumstances, this issue is decided in favour of respondent no.3. RELIEF: 26In view of issuewise findings above, the claim petition fails and is hereby dismissed with no order as to costs. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly. File be consigned to records.

A W A R D 1.This is a claim petition preferred by the claimants for grant of compensation on account of death of Ajmer Singh in a motor vehicle 1 Krishana v. Rajat Pal Singh accident. 2.The claimants have filed the present claim petition on the averments that on 11.7.2015, deceased was going driving his motorcycle No. PB-65-U-5558 from village Madanheri to Kharar, District SAS Nagar. When at about 2.00 pm, he reached on Randhawa-Kharar road and was on his correct left side at normal speed, in the mean time respondent No.1 came on wrong side driving his motorcycle No. PB-65-AB-9734 from opposite direction at a very high rash speed and in negligent manner and hit the motorcycle of the deceased.

Claimant have no sufficient source of their income after the death of their son and they are at the edge of starvation. The claimants have suffered a huge loss due to sudden and untimely death of the deceased. 4.Respondents No. 1 & 2 in their written statement denied the averments made in the claim petition. 2 Krishana v. Rajat Pal Singh 5.Respondent No.3 in its written statement took preliminary objections that this Court has no territorial jurisdiction as the claimants were residents of Village Madanheri, Tehsil Kharar, District Mohali and owner and driver of alleged motorcycle No. PB-65-AB-9734 were also resident of Mohali. The claim petition was filed by the claimants in collusion with respondents No.1 & 2 just to get illegal compensation. The driver of the offending motorcycle was not holding a valid and effective driving licence. The vehicle in question was being driven in violation of the terms and conditions of the policy of insurance. On merits, the involvement of the motorcycle No. PB-65-AB-9734 was denied in the alleged accident. Neither any accident, as alleged, took place nor the vehicle allegedly insured with the answering respondent was involved thereof. On merits, the averments made in the claim petition have been denied. 6.From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed: 1.Whether deceased Ajmer Singh died in a motor vehicle accident, which took place on 11.7.2015 at 2.00 pm due to rash and negligent driving by respondent No.1? OPA. 2.Whether the claimants are entitled to compensation on account of death of deceased Ajmer Singh ? If so, from whom and to which extent ? OPA. 3.Whether the driver of the offending vehicle was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident ? OPR 3. 4.Relief. 3 Krishana v. Rajat Pal Singh 7.In order to prove the assertions as made in the claim petition, claimants examined Gurpreet Singh eye witness as PW.1. Claimant Hakam Ram, father of the deceased, himself stepped into the witness box as PW.2 and thereafter, the counsel for the claimants closed the evidence. 8. The respondents examined Surinder Jan, Investigator as RW.1. The respondent No.1 tendered into evidence registration certificate of motorcycle No. PB-65-AB-9734 Exhibit R1; copy of insurance cover note Exhibit R2 and photocopy of driving licence Exhibit R3 and closed his evidence. The counsel for respondent No.3 tendered into evidence copy of insurance policy Exhibit R1 and then closed the evidence. 9.I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and also gone through the record. My issue-wise findings are as under : Issue No.1. Whether deceased Ajmer Singh died in a motor vehicle accident, which took place on 11.7.2015 at 2.00 pm due to rash and negligent driving by respondent No.1? OPP. 10. The onus to prove this issue was on the claimants. In order to prove this issue, the claimant Hakam Ram, who was the father of the deceased appeared as PW.2. He deposed that deceased was his son, who died in a motor vehicular accident at the age of 20 years. PW.1 Gurpreet Singh, who was the eye witness, has deposed that on 11.7.2015, 4 Krishana v. Rajat Pal Singh he was going driving his motorcycle towards Kharar on Randhawa- Kharar Road. When at about 2.00 pm, he saw that deceased Ajmer Singh was going driving his motorcycle No. PB-65-U-5558 ahead of him and was on his correct left side at normal speed, in the mean time respondent No.1 came on wrong side driving his motorcycle No. PB-65-AB-9734 from opposite direction at a very high rash speed and in negligent manner and hit the motorcycle of the deceased. As a result of which, Ajmer Sngh fell down and suffered multiple injuries on vital organs of his body. Though he was taken to Civil Hospital, Kharar, but his condition being serious, he was referred to PGI Hospital, Chandigarh, where despite best treatment given to him he died on 12.7.2015. This accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. In his cross- examination, the witness denied the suggestion that he was not present at the time of accident. He further denied the suggestion that a false FIR ws registered against respondent No.1. He deposed that the FIR Exhibit P1 was registered on his statement. He denied the suggestion that respondent No.1 was not negligent in causing the accident and deceased himself was negligent in causing the accident. He further deposed that he was brother of the deceased and they were going back to home from Sabzi Mandi. He further denied the suggestion that the deceased was having huge sanitary items on his motorcycle at the time of accident, due to which his motorcycle became imbalance and resulted into accident. He deposed that 20 to 50 persons gathered at the spot at the time of accident as it was very busy road. 5 Krishana v. Rajat Pal Singh 11. Respondent No.1 has not contested the claim petition. Only he could deny the accident or explain the manner in which the accident was caused. As such, adverse inference is liable to be taken against him. 12. As stated above, PW.1 is the eye witness to the occurrence. He has recorded in his statement that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the driver of the offending motorcycle. Respondent No.1 is also facing trial for causing this accident. He has never represented to any authority against his false implication. All these circumstances in their totality suggest that accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent No.1. Moreover, the respondents failed to prove that there was any negligence on the part of deceased. 13. There is further evidence that deceased died due to injuries suffered in the accident. The postmortem report is Exhibit P2. The cause of death was stated to be craniocerebral trauma, which was sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. The injuries were antemortem in nature. It is, therefore, held that deceased died as a result of injuries sustained by him in a motor vehicular accident, which was caused by rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1. This issue is decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. 6 Krishana v. Rajat Pal Singh Issue No.2. Whether the claimants are entitled to compensation on account of death of deceased Ajmer Singh ? If so, from whom and to which extent ? OPA. 14. PW.2 Hakam Ram is the father of the deceased. He has stated that deceased was 20 years old at the time of accident. PW.2 further deposed that deceased was plumber by profession and was earning 10,000/- per month. He had very bright future ahead of him. The₹ claimant No.1 is the mother of the deceased and claimant No.2 is the father of the deceased and as such, they are the legal heirs of the deceased and are entitled to receive the amount of compensation awarded by this Tribunal. 15. There is no documentary proof regarding the income being earned by the deceased. However, he would have earned handsome income, had he be not met with any accident. Even a 10+2 student would have earned atleast 8,000/- per month and that too by doing odd white ₹ colour job. As such, the monthly income of the claimant is assessed as 8,000/- per month.₹ 16. As per postmortem report Exhibit P2, the deceased was 20 years of age at the time of his death. Multiplier of 18 is applicable. Giving 50% increase due to loss of future income, in view of the law laid down in Santosh Devi v. National Insurance Company, 2012 STPL (Web) SC 248, the total income of the deceased comes to 12,000/- per ₹ month. 1/3rd of the income is liable to be deducted as personal expenses 7 Krishana v. Rajat Pal Singh of the deceased, which comes to 4,000/-. The balance comes to ₹ 8,000/-. Applying multiplier of 18, the loss of dependency comes to₹ 17,28,000/-.₹ 17. In the case of Rajesh and another v. Rajbir Singh 2013(3) RCR(Civil) 170, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that a sum of 25,000/- for funeral and last rites. Awarding said amounts to the ₹ claimants, the total amount of compensation to which the claimants are entitled thus comes to 17,53,000/-. Accordingly, the claimants are held ₹ entitled to get compensation of 17,53,000/- in equal shares. ₹ This issue to the above extent is decided in favour of claimants and against the respondents. Issue No.3. Whether the respondent No.1 was not having a valid driving licence at the time of accident ? OPR. 18. The onus to prove this issue was upon respondent No.3 which has not brought any evidence that respondent No.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence to drive the offending vehicle as on the date of accident. However, the driving licence of respondent No.1 is placed on record as Exhibit R3, which authorised the respondent No.1 to drive MCWG, LMV only and which was valid upto 14.6.2034. As such, it is held that the respondent No.1 was having valid driving licence at the time of accident. This issue is, therefore, decided against respondent No.3 and in favour of respondents No.1. 8 Krishana v. Rajat Pal Singh Issue No.4 (Relief). 19. In view of findings on issues above, the claim petition is allowed with costs and an Award for 17,53,000/- ₹(Seventeen lacs fifty three thousand) only, is passed in favour of the claimants in equal shares and against the respondents. Claimants shall also be entitled to get interest @ 7.5 per cent per annum on the amount of Award from the date of petition till realization of the entire amount of the Award. The respondents shall be jointly and severally liable to pay the Award amount. Counsel fee is assessed as 3,000/-. Memo of costs be prepared. File be ₹ consigned to the record room.

The arguments advanced by learned counsel for the claimants are duly considered apart from perusing the record. The evidence led by the claimants goes un-rebutted and unchallenged on the file, as the respondent did not contest the petition and was proceeded against ex- parte. PW1 Smt.Sushma Sachdeva, who is eye witness has well deposed in her statement that on 9.3.2015 at about 7.30 AM she was going from Chandigarh to Bathinda while sitting in an Indica car which was being driven by its driver at slow speed and on the left side of the road. Sh.Prateek Sachdeva was going ahead of her while sitting in a swift car bearing registration No.CH01-AK-0766 which was being driven by Sh.Sunil at slow speed and on the left side of the road. Sachin was other occupant of the aforesaid car. When they were one kilometer short from Standard Chowk, Handiaya at that time some stray cattles entered the 6 Smt. Sachdeva & others vs. Tarinder Singh road from their left and to avert striking against them the driver of Swift Car Sh.Sunil swerved his car very little to his right and was still on left side of the road. In the meantime a Tata Safari bearing registration No.PB-10-DT-1563 came at fast speed from the opposite direction and while coming on the wrong side of the road it struck against their car. As a result of this accident they all received serious injuries. They all were taken to Civil Hospital-Barnala immediately where Sh.Prateek Sachdeva died due to the injuries he sustained in this accident. The aforesaid Tata Safari was being driven at fast speed and in a rash and negligent manner by Sh.Tarinder Singh. The accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of Tata Safari bearing registration No.PB-10-DT-1563 driven by Sh.Tarinder Singh respondent No.1. The deceased was not at all at fault. A criminal case was registered against Sh.Tarinder Singh for causing this accident on the basis of the statement of Smt.Sushma Sachdeva. Her statement is further corroborated by documentary evidence also. The copy of FIR is on the record as Ex.P1 and the copy of PMR is on the record as Ex.P3. These documents are very strong corroborative piece of evidence. From her statement and other evidence the accident and death of Prateek Sachdeva in the accident are well proved. 9. Now it is to be seen that who was rash and negligent for the said accident. It is clear from the statement that some stray cattles entered the road from left side of the vehicle in which the deceased was sitting and it was taken a little on right side and Safari coming from the 7 Smt. Sachdeva & others vs. Tarinder Singh front side on hight speed hit the vehicle in which the deceased was sitting due to which he expired. From the evidence it is made out that the said accident has taken place almost in the middle of the road and it was head on collusion. In such circumstances, it is a case of contributory negligence and negligence of both the driver is assessed as 50%. 10.As far as quantum is concerned as per income tax statements of last 3 years of deceased which are placed on record as Ex.P10 to to Ex.P12 the deceased was having income of Rs.6,97,554/-, Rs.3,95,020/- and Rs.4,35,120/- respectively. However, income tax is to be deducted from that amount as mentioned in the statement. Apart from that the income tax statement of the company of the accused is on the record from Ex.P55 to Ex.P57 the income of Rs.3,46,759/-, Rs.3,19,796/- and Rs.5,02,661/- respectively is reflected in that statements also. Now the contention of the learned counsel for the claimant is that both this income should be added. In this regard this Court is of the view that the income tax statement Ex.P10 to Ex.P12 is the personal income of the deceased while the income tax statement Ex.P55 to Ex.P57 is the income tax statement of the company and not of the deceased, therefore, Ex.P55 to Ex.P57 cannot be taken while assessing the compensation. Learned counsel submitted that the deceased was having the income of the company as sole proprietor and he was having personal income also, therefore, both should be taken but there is no such averment in the statement of PW2. It is mentioned in the statement that the deceased was 8 Smt. Sachdeva & others vs. Tarinder Singh earning from the contract for outsourcing and no other source of income of the deceased is alleged in the statement. At the time of arguments also except from this business no other source of income the deceased is disclosed. It means that the income of the deceased from the company has been reflected in his income tax statement Ex.P10 to Ex.P12 and only this income tax statement is to be considered. These statements are for the assessment years 2014-15, 2013-14 and 2012-13. The income of the deceased was fluctuating, therefore, the average income of three years is to be considered as his yearly income. The income in the income tax statement Ex.P10 for the assessment year 2014-15 was Rs.6,97,554/- and income tax to the tune of Rs.58,650/- was paid. In this way the income of the deceased for the year 2014-15 was Rs.6,38,904/- in the year. Similarly, the income of the deceased for the assessment year 2013-14 was Rs.3,95,020/- and income tax to the tune of Rs.9100/- was paid. As such the income of the deceased for the year 2013-14 was Rs.3,85,920/-. The income of the deceased for the assessment year 2012-13 was Rs.4,35,120/- and Rs.16440/- was paid as income tax and the income after deducting comes to Rs.4,18,680/-. The total of the three income comes to Rs.14,43,504/- and average income comes to Rs.14,43,500/- x1/3=Rs.4,81,168/-. 1/3rd is to be deducted as personal expenses which comes to Rs.1,60,384/-. In this way the income which he was giving to his family for the purpose of compensation comes to the tune of Rs.4,81,168/- (-) Rs.1,60,389/-=Rs.3,20,779/-. The deceased was between 34 to 35 years of age as per his given date of birth and as per PMR Ex.P3 9 Smt. Sachdeva & others vs. Tarinder Singh also at the time of accident, therefore, the multiplier of 16 is to be applied in view of the law laid down by Smt. Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Anr., 2009(3) RCR (Civil), 77. The amount of 50% of same comes to tune of Rs.25,66,232/- claim comes to the tune of Rs.3,20,779x16=Rs.51,32,464/-. The claimants are entitled for 40% increase as future prospects in view of the law laid down in law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled as National Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Pranay Sethi and others Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.25590 of 2014 decided on 31.10.2017 , which comes to Rs.10,26,492/-. In view of the above law the claimants are entitled for expenses incurred on cremation to the tune of Rs.15,000/-. Apart from that, claimant No.1 is entitled to consortium to Rs.40,000/-. Claimants 2 to 4 are entitled to Rs.15,000/- as loss of estate. In this way, the claimants are entitled for Rs.25,66,232/- + Rs.10,26,492/-+ Rs.15,000/- + Rs.40,000/- + Rs.15,000/-= Rs.36,72,674/- Rs.36,73,000 when it is rounded off. The claimants are also entitled for interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the realization of the whole of this amount from the respondent. 11. In view of above discussion, it is held that the claimants are entitled for compensation and an award of Rs.36,73, 000/- (Rs.Thirty Six Lacs Seventy Three Thousand only) is hereby passed in favour of claimants and against the respondents along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the realization 10 Smt. Sachdeva & others vs. Tarinder Singh of the whole of this amount from the respondent. The share of compensation amount of the claimants shall be as under:- Claimant no.1 = 50% Claimant no.2 = 25% Claimant no.3 = 15% Claimant no.4 = 10% (through LRs) 12.The amount of minor claimant No.2 shall be deposited in the form of FDR in her names in any nationalized bank of the choice of her guardian which the minor claimant No.2 shall be entitled to withdraw after attaining the majority.

The claimants have also suffered love and affection of the deceased being wife, mother and father. The entire family of the deceased has been ruined. 4.Respondents No.1 & 2 in their written reply took preliminary objections that the respondent No.1 was having a valid driving licence to drive the vehicle in question.

On merits, it was submitted that FIR was based upon totally false, misconceived and concocted averments, as the accident had not taken place on account of rash or negligent driving on the part of the respondent No.1, nor in the manner, it was mentioned in the FIR. The complainant was not present at the spot at the time of accident and was introduced as the alleged eye witness, in connivance with the police. The truck had not struck the scooter, rather the deceased while driving the scooter rashly, negligently and at a high speed, could not negotiate the turn and struck with the truck, resulting into the accident. A false FIR was registered against the respondent No.1 on the complaint of Raj Kumar Sharma. Other averments of the claim petition have been denied. 5.Respondent No.3 in its written reply took preliminary objections that no accident as alleged was taken place with allege vehicle i.e. Truck Tipper No. HR-68-C-0333.

The counsel for respondent No.3 also closed the evidence. 4 Lalita Devi v. Randhir Singh 9.I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and also gone through the record. My issue-wise findings are as under : Issue No.1. Whether deceased Ajay Sharma died in a motor vehicle accident, which took place on 12.9.2015 at about 6.15 pm due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 while driving vehicle No. HR-68-C-0333 ? OPA. 10. The onus to prove this issue was on the claimants. In order to prove this issue, the claimants examined Raj Kumar Sharma, eye witness as PW.2, who has deposed that on 12.9.2015 at about 6:15 pm, he was going on the road leading from Railway Light Point towards Village Daria, while driving motorcycle at slow speed and on the left side of the road. His brother Ajay Sharma was going behind him while driving an Activa Honda at slow speed and on the left side of the road. When they reached near Garcha turn, at that time, a Truck Tipper No. HR-68-C-0333 came at fast speed from behind and struck against the Activa of the deceased and, thereafter, dragged both the deceased and Activa to a distance of about 30/32 steps and crushed the deceased before coming to halt. The accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of Truck Tipper No. HR-68-C-0333 driven by respondent No.1. The deceased was not at all at fault. A criminal case was registered against the respondent for causing this accident on the basis of his statement. In his cross-examination, he has denied the suggestion that he was not present at the place of the accident. He further denied the suggestion that FIR was lodged against respondent No. 1 on wrong facts. He further denied the suggestion that he did not witness the accident. He further denied the 5 Lalita Devi v. Randhir Singh suggestion that the accident took place due to the negligence of his brother. He further denied that the driver of the Tipper Truck was not driving his vehicle rashly and negligently. His testimony is corroborated by PW.1 Lalita Devi, who deposed that deceased met with a roadside accident on 12.9.2015 and died due to the injuries he sustained in this accident. 11. Respondent No.1 has not contested the claim petition. Only he could deny the accident or explain the manner in which the accident was caused. As such adverse inference is liable to be taken against him. 12. As stated above, PW.2 is the author of the FIR being an eye witness to the occurrence. He has recorded in his statement that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the driver of the Tipper Truck No. HR-68-C-0333. Respondent No.1 is also facing trial for causing this accident. He has never represented to any authority against his false implication. All these circumstances in their totality suggest that accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent No.1. 13. There is further evidence that deceased sustained injuries in the accident leading to his death. The postmortem report is Exhibit P1. The cause of death was stated to be eviscerated crushed injury, which is sufficient to cause death in ordinary course of nature. The injuries were 6 Lalita Devi v. Randhir Singh antemortem in nature. It is, therefore, held that deceased died as a result of injuries sustained by him in a motor vehicular accident, which was caused by rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1. This issue is decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. Issue No.2. Whether the claimants are entitled to compensation on account of death of Ajay Sharma, if yes, from whom and to which extent ? OPA. 14. PW.1 Lalita Devi is the wife of the deceased. She has deposed that deceased was 30 years of age at the time of accident. The deceased was hale and hearty and was maintaining a very good health. She further deposed that the deceased was self employed and was earning a sum of 15,000/- approximately, while working as a Marketing ₹ Manager with Dr Ashima Kohli, Proprietor, Samrat Dental and Medical Traders. He used to give a sum of 12,000/- per month to her for meeting ₹ household expenses. Claimant No.2 is the mother of the deceased and claimant No.3 is the father of the deceased. All the claimants were dependent upon the income of the deceased being wife, son and mother of the deceased. 15. PW.3 Ashima Kohli, Proprietor, Samrat Dental and Medical Traders deposed that Ajay Sharma was working with her since 16.4.2015 as Marketing Manager. He was drawing a salary of 15,000/- ₹ per month at the time of his death. He was a sincere, honest and devoted 7 Lalita Devi v. Randhir Singh employee. She used to pay the salary in cash. She further deposed that her business has suffered a lot due to his untimely death. She produced the salary certificate of the deceased as Exhibit P23. As such, the monthly income of the deceased is held to be 15,000/-. ₹ 16. As per certificate Exhibit P1, the deceased was aged 30 years of age at the time of his death. Multiplier of 17 is applicable. Giving 50% increase due to loss of future income, in view of the law laid down in Santosh Devi v. National Insurance Company, 2012 STPL (Web) SC 248, the total income of the deceased comes to 22,500/- per ₹ month. 1/3rd of the income is liable to be deducted as personal expenses of the deceased, which comes to 7,500/-. The balance comes to ₹ 15,000/-. Applying multiplier of 17, the loss of dependency comes to₹ 30,60,000/-.₹ 17. In the case of Rajesh and another v. Rajbir Singh 2013(3) RCR(Civil) 170, , the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that a sum of 1,00,000/- be awarded as consortium and a sum of 25,000/- for ₹ ₹ funeral and last rites. Awarding said amounts to the claimants, the total amount of compensation to which the claimants No. 1 to 3 are entitled thus comes to 31,85,000/-. Accordingly, the claimants are held entitled ₹ to get compensation of 31,85,000 /-. ₹This issue to the above extent is decided in favour of claimants and against the respondents. Issue No. 3. 8 Lalita Devi v. Randhir Singh Whether the driver of offending vehicle was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident ? OPR-3 18. The onus to prove this issue was on the respondent No.3, which has not led any evidence. However, driving licence of respondent No.1 is placed on record Exhibit R3, which shows that the respondent No.1 was authorised to drive scooter, LMV , HMV only. It is, therefore, held that the respondent No.1 was authorised to drive the offending vehicle. It is, therefore, held that respondent No.3 has failed to prove this issue, which is decided against it and in favour of respondent No.1. Issue No.4 (Relief). 19. In view of findings on issues above, the claim petition is allowed with costs and an Award for 31,85,000/- ₹(Thirty one lacs eighty five thousand) only, is passed in favour of the claimants No.1 to 3 to the extent of wife - 50%, and remaining claimants No.2 & 3 – 25% each and against the respondents.

Present: Thakur Kartar Singh, Counsel for the claimants. Sh. Janak Raj Arora, Advocate, Counsel for respondent No. 1. Respondent No. 2 exparte. Sh. Ram Avtar, Advocate, Counsel for respondent No. 3. :AWARD: Jeevandeep Singh son of Daljit Singh, resident of House No. Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. 2 Narinder Kaur & another Vs. Sahiba and others 1051-A, Electricity Colony, Sector 52, Chandigarh (for short, the deceased) having died, allegedly in a motor vehicular accident, Narinder Kaur and Daljit Singh, parents, claiming themselves to be his only legal heirs, have invoked provisions of Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (here-in- after to be referred as “the Act”) by way of this application to claim compensation amounting to Rs.50,00,000/-. It was stated in the application that the deceased was 22 years old and was a student of M.Sc. (Maths) Final Year; that on 30.07.2015, Jeevandeep Singh, since deceased was coming from his college towards his home on his motor cycle bearing registration No. CH01-AQ-0276; that when he reached near House No. 19, Sector 10, Chandigarh, Activa Scooter bearing registration No. CH03-S-7325 being driven by respondent No. 1 Sahiba in rash and negligent manner, rammed her vehicle into the motorcycle being driven by deceased; that as a result of accident, Jeevandeep, since deceased fell on the road and suffered multiple grievous injuries; that Jeevandeep Singh was shifted to PGI, Chandigarh where despite best treatment given to him expired on 31.07.2015; that in respect of the accident, First Information Report no. 121 dated 31.07.2015, was registered at Police Station North, Chandigarh, under Sections 279, 337 of Indian Penal Code against unknown vehicle. 2.Notice of the application was issued to the respondents No. 1 to 3, but respondent No. 2 did not appear despite his service through publication in the newspaper “Punjabi Tribune” dated 17.05.2016 for 08.07.2016, and was proceeded against exparte vide order dated 11.07.2016. However, respondents No. 1 & 3 have contested the application by filing written replies in two sets, one by respondent no. 1 and the other by respondent no.3. Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. 3 Narinder Kaur & another Vs. Sahiba and others 3.In written reply filed by respondent no.1, contents of the application were denied and it was submitted that accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of the answering respondent. It was further submitted that the Activa of the answering respondent was struck by an unknown car, which came from the opposite direction and thereafter, the motorcycle of the deceased struck firstly against the said car and thereafter, struck against the Activa of the answering respondent; that even the deceased was driving his motor cycle at fast speed due to which he could not control his motor cycle, so the claimants were not entitled to claim any compensation. 4.In reply filed by respondent no.3, insurer of the offending vehicle, contents of the application were denied and legal objections were taken, inter alia, that the claim application was not maintainable in the present form; that liability of the company would arise only if driver of the offending vehicle was holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the accident and the vehicle was being driven as per provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act; and that highly excessive and exaggerated claim had been filed. 5.In both the written replies, the respondents prayed for dismissal of the application. 6.As a result of the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed vide order dated 11.07.2016 :- 1.Whether Jeevandeep Singh died in a road side accident due to rash and negligent driving of Activa bearing registration No. CH03-S-7325 by respondent No. 1?OPP. Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. 4 Narinder Kaur & another Vs. Sahiba and others 2.Whether the claimants are entitled to compensation, if so to what amount and from whom?OPP. 3.Whether respondent No. 1 was not having a valid and effective driving license at the time of accident?OPR-3. 4.Relief. 7.In order to prove their case, applicant no.2 Daljit Singh himself stepped into the witness box as PW-3 and examined PW-1 Sanjeev Kumar, PW-2 Sukhdev Singh and closed their evidence, while to rebut the aforesaid evidence, learned counsel for respondent No. 1 tendered copy of driving license of respondent No. 1, copy of registration certificate and copy of Insurance policy of vehicle in question as Ex.R-1 to Ex.R-3 respectively and closed his evidence, whereas, learned counsel for respondent No. 3 tendered copy of Insurance Policy as Ex.R-3 and closed its evidence. 8.I have heard Thakur Kartar Singh, Advocate, learned counsel for the applicants, Sh. Janak Raj Arora, Advocate, learned counsel for respondent no. 1, Sh. Ram Avtar, Advocate, counsel for respondent no.3 and have gone through the pleadings of the parties and evidence available on record. 9. My issue wise findings are as under: Issue No. 1: 10.Onus of this issue was upon the applicants and they were required to prove that respondent no.1 caused the accident by her rash and negligent driving of the Activa Honda, bearing registration No.CH03-S-7325 that belonged to respondent no.2. 11.The argument of learned counsel for the applicants, at the outset, was that in the evidence of PW-1 Sanjeev Kumar, which was supported by Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. 5 Narinder Kaur & another Vs. Sahiba and others PW-2 Sukhdev Singh, who witnessed the accident, factum and manner of occurrence had been sufficiently proved. It was further contended that involvement of the offending vehicle had also been proved from copy of first Information report, Exhibit P-1, which was lodged with respect to the accident in question, further fortified plea of the applicants as regards factum and manner of the accident showing that respondent no.1 was negligent in driving the Activa Honda in question, which resulted into the accident in which the deceased lost his life. 12.On behalf of the respondents it was argued by their learned counsel that factum and manner of occurrence remained unproved. The further contention of the learned counsel for the respondents was that in fact respondent No. 1 was not negligent in driving the vehicle in question and the claim application was filed against the respondents with an ulterior motive to get compensation from the respondents. 13.I have anxiously considered rival contentions of the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the record carefully. 14.As per case of the applicants and as deposed by PW-1 Sanjeev Kumar, on 30.07.2015 at about 12:30 p.m., when he reached near H.No. 19, Sector 10, Chandigarh he saw Jeevandeep Singh coming driving his motorcycle bearing registration no. CH01-AQ-0276 from the side of college and respondent No. 1 Sahiba came driving the Activa Scooter bearing registration No. CH03-S-7325 at a high speed, in rash and negligent manner and rammed into the motorcycle of deceased; that as a result of accident, Jeevandeen fell on the road and suffered multiple injuries, including head injury, which proved fatal. On the similar lines, Sukhdev Singh had deposed Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. 6 Narinder Kaur & another Vs. Sahiba and others as PW-2. The claimants have also produced on record copy of First Information Report Ex.P-1, lodged in respect of the accident in question. 15.A close scrutiny of First Information Report lodged regarding the accident in question shows that it was registered on the statement of complainant Anil Kumar son of Om Parkash on 31.07.2016 at 12:05 hours against unknown person and car of white colour, without mentioning its make or registration number, wherein he had stated that on 30.07.2015 at about 12:30 p.m. he was going to his house at Naya Gaon and he crossed the Parking Beat Box, Sector 10, Chandigarh when a white color car, being driven in rash and negligent manner came and rammed straightway into a girl who was coming on Activa and a motorcycle being driven by boy; that the car fled away from the spot. Though, the factum of accident had been admitted by respondent No. 1 Sahiba while filing the written statement, however, she had categorically denied the negligence on her part. To prove the manner of the accident and negligence on the part of respondent No. 1, the claimants had examined PW-1 Sanjeev Kumar and PW-2 Sukhdev Singh who had categorically stated in their affidavits Ex.PW-1/A and Ex.PW-2/A that their statements were recorded by the police, in which they narrated the manner in which the accident took place. However, the claimants have failed to produce on record the copies of said statements allegedly recorded by the police in respect of the accident. Further, the applicants have also failed to prove the presence of both the eye witnesses at the spot by leading cogent and convincing evidence. Applicants have not examined Anil Kumar at whose behest criminal law was set into motion regarding the accident in question. In order to prove negligence on the part of respondent no.1, the Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. 7 Narinder Kaur & another Vs. Sahiba and others applicants could examine Anil Kumar, author of the First Information Report or to produce record of criminal case regarding the accident in question but the applicants failed to do so for the reasons best known. 16.It is a settled legal position that the proof of rashness and negligence on the part of the driver of the vehicle is sine qua non for maintaining an application under Section 166 of the Act. To prove factum of accident alone without proving the rash and negligent driving on the part of the driver shall not entitle the claimants to the grant of compensation in a petition filed under Section 166 of the Act. In this regard, while distinguishing Sections 166 and 163-A of the Act in Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. versus Meena Variyal, (2007) 5 Supreme Court Cases 428 Hon'ble the Supreme Court of India was pleased to observe as under: “Therefore, the victim of an accident or his dependants have an option either to proceed under Section 166 of the Act or under Section 163-A of the Act. Once they approach the Tribunal under Section 166 of the Act, they have necessarily to take upon themselves the burden of establishing the negligence of the driver or owner of the vehicle concerned. But if they proceed under Section 163-A of the Act, the compensation will be awarded in terms of the Schedule without calling upon the victim or his dependants to establish any negligence or default on the part of the owner of the vehicle or the driver of the vehicle ”. 17.In order to prove the rashness and negligent driving of the respondent no.1 which allegedly led to the accident in question as alleged by the applicants, PW-1 Sanjeev Kumar and PW-2 Sukhdev Singh have been examined but their evidence lacks credibility for want of cogent and convincing circumstance to prove that the accident took place due to rash and Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. 8 Narinder Kaur & another Vs. Sahiba and others negligent driving of respondent No. 1 and their deposition is totally contrary to the first version of First Information Report Ex.P-1 which was recorded promptly just after the accident in question. 18.In view of the above discussion, it is apparent, now two versions of the accident in question are forthcoming. The initial version which was got recorded before the police by Anil Kumar promptly was that one white color, which was being driven in a rash and negligent manner and the driver of the said car struck against the Activa driven by Girl, coming from the opposite side, and that motorcyclist coming from behind struck against the said car and then hit with the Activa Honda and that driver of the car slipped away with the vehicle. Now, the changed version given by the claimant was that girl rider of the Activa was driving the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and hit against the motor cycle of the deceased resulting into injuries because of which he expired. As per the said initial version recorded in the FIR even PW-2 Sanjeev Kumar and PW-3 Sukhdev Singh, who have been examined in the course of trial, had not witnessed the accident in question. It, therefore, was incumbent on the part of the claimant to have explained as to under what circumstances Anil Kumar, eye witness of the accident narrated the said initial version to the police or that he was having enmity against the claimant party or had any special infinity with the real offender. The non examination of the said eye witness of the accident Anil Kumar and non mentioning of the name of PW-2 Sanjeev Kumar and PW-3 Sukhdev Singh, who have been examined, in the FIR as witnesses of the accident, cuts at the very root the case of the claimants regarding the manner in which the accident took place. Rather, it shows that as the identity of the offending car Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. 9 Narinder Kaur & another Vs. Sahiba and others or its driver could not be revealed in the course of the investigation, the family of the deceased coined a new version for putting the blame on the rider of the Activa for seeking compensation from her for the death of Jeevandeep Singh. Even the investigating officer of the FIR registered in the case in hand was not examined due to reason best known. Therefore, to my mind the claimants miserably failed to establish that accident in question took place due to rash or negligent driving of respondent No. 1, rider of the Activa Honda. It may be that claimants have been able to prove that death of Jeevandeep Singh had been took place as a result of injuries suffered in the accident but the person due to whose rash and negligent driving, the accident took place could not be ascertained. Neither in the investigation of the police nor for that matter it could be established in the present proceedings or examining PW-2 Sanjeev Kumar and PW-3 Sukhdev Singh, who apparently being connected and known to the claimants party could be more than willing to support their case. It is no doubt true that the evidence to be produced before the Claims Tribunal need not be proved beyond reasonable doubt as it is required before a Criminal Court, yet at the same time the negligence on the part of the driver of the vehicle under reference has to be proved as a matter of fact by leading sufficient evidence to satisfy the Tribunal that due to rashness and negligence of a driver, the accident had taken place. However, the applicants have miserably failed to discharge their onus to prove rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. In view of aforesaid discussion, we find that effort of the applicants to prove the rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and placing on record copy of First Information Report, Exhibit P-1, has misfired. Therefore, it can be safely concluded that the Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. 10 Narinder Kaur & another Vs. Sahiba and others applicants have failed to prove on record that deceased Jeevandeep Singh had lost his life as a result of the rash and negligent driving of respondent No. 1 of Activa Honda in question belonging to respondent no.2. 18.In view of aforesaid discussion, this issue is decided against the applicants and in favour of the respondents. Issue No. 2: 19.Decision of this issue, onus whereof was also upon the applicants, was dependant upon issue no. 1, which has been decided against the applicants. Even otherwise, proof of negligence of the driver of the Activa Honda in question is sine qua non for claiming compensation under Section 166 of the Act. The applicants, however, have failed to prove that deceased Jeevandeep Singh had lost his life as a result of the motor vehicle accident due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 of car in question belonging to respondent no.2. Therefore, the applicants cannot be held entitled to claim any compensation from any of the respondents. Therefore, this issue is also decided against the applicants and in favour of the respondents. Issue no.3: 20. Onus to prove this issue was upon respondent no.3. Since under issues no.1 and 2, it has already been held that the applicants are not entitled to any compensation from any of the respondents, this issue has become redundant and the issue stands disposed of accordingly. Relief: 21.As a result of the findings given on the issues discussed above, it Balbir Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Chandigarh. 11 Narinder Kaur & another Vs. Sahiba and others is held that the claimants are not entitled to any compensation and the application is, accordingly, dismissed with costs. Counsel fee is assessed as 2,200/-.
