He is self employed in running a readymade garment shop under the name and style of M/s Funky Guys, Samrala Chowk, Chandigarh Road, Ludhiana. He has suffered multiple and grievous injuries resulting into permanent disability and was brought to the CMC Hospital, Ludhiana and is still under treatment and confined to bed. 3.It has been averred that on 14.8.2015, claimant was going from Baba Deep Singh Gurudwara to Deep Hospital side, Ludhiana on motorcycle bearing No.PB-10-D-9030. He was driving the motorcycle on a very slow speed and on the correct side of the road. When he reached near Tarkona Park, a car bearing Registration No.PB-10-DQ-8386 came from left side on a very high speed in a rash and negligent manner without blowing horn and struck against the motorcycle of the claimant due to which he suffered multiple grievous injuries and was brought to the CMC Hospital, Ludhiana where he remained admitted and is still under treatment and confined to bed. His motorcycle was also damaged. As the claimant was in the hospital, his relatives tried their best to lodge the case against respondent No.1, but in vain. The injured sent a letter to the police authorities, P.S. Model Town, Ludhiana for registration of the case but of no avail. A sum of Rs.8,00,000/- was spent on his treatment, transportation, medicines etc. The accident took place on account of sole Page: 3 Manmohan Singh vs. Manmeet Singh MACT No.87 of 10.12.2015 rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 while driving the car bearing Registration No.PB-10-DQ-8386. It is claimed that the respondents are liable to pay the compensation amount of Rs.40,00,000/- (forty lacs). 4.Consequent upon notice of the claim petition, the respondents appeared and filed their separate written statement. The respondent No.1 took the preliminary objections in his written statement that the claim petition is legally not maintainable against the respondent No.1, the alleged accident has taken place due to the negligence of the claimant himself; the respondent No.1 is a trained and experienced driver. The respondent No.1 is having a valid driving licence, registration of the car and insurance at the time of accident at the time of alleged accident. The claim petition is bad for misjoinder and non joinder of necessary parties, the claimant has not impleadeed the owner and insurance company of his own vehicle as party. On merits, the mode and manner of accident has been denied. It is averred that the accident took place due to negligence of the claimant himself. While denying all other averments and while reiterating the averments of the preliminary objections, it has ultimately been prayed that the claim petition may be dismissed. 5.The respondent No.2 filed written statement taking the preliminary objections that the claim petition is not maintainable; the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimant as the respondent No1. Is driver and owner of car bearing Registration No.PB- 10-DQ-8386, did not have valid and effective driving licence at the time Page: 4 Manmohan Singh vs. Manmeet Singh MACT No.87 of 10.12.2015 of alleged accident which is clear violation of the terms and conditions of the policy. The claim petition is bad for non joinder and misjoider of necessary parties. The claimant has not impleaded the owner and insurance company of the motorcycle No.PB-10-D-9030 as party to the proceedings. The car bearing Registration No.PB-10-DQ-8386 did not have the valid registration certificate and fitness certificate at the time of alleged accident which amounts to breach of terms of policy, thus the respondent No.2 is not liable to any compensation. The insurance of the subject vehicle should comply with Section 64(V)(b) of the Insurance Act, 1938. the claimant should file affidavit/undertaking to the effect that he has not filed any claim petition in any Court of law arising out of the same accident. The respondent No.2 takes all the defences available to it under Section 134, 147, 149, 157 and 170 of the Motor Vehicle Act. The claimant has not furnished his residence proof, identity proof, PAN card and affidavit to the effect that he has not filed or received any other claim from the same cause of action to show that he is legally entitled to file the present claim petition at Ludhiana or at any other place and the answering respondent reserves its right to file amended written statement as and when new facts are brought on record. On merits, the mode and manner of accident has been denied. While denying all other averments and while reiterating the averments of the preliminary objections, it has ultimately been prayed that the claim petition may be dismissed. 6.On the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed and recorded: Page: 5 Manmohan Singh vs. Manmeet Singh MACT No.87 of 10.12.2015 “1. Whether the Claimant suffered the injuries and damage was caused to his motorcycle because of rash and negligent driving of the car bearing registration No.PB-10-AQ-8386 rashly and negligently?

Whether the driver of the offending vehicle is not having valid driving licence and the insured has violated the terms of the condition? If so, its effect? OPR. 5. Whether the claim petition is bad for non joinder of necessary parties? OPR. 6. Relief.” 7.Claimant Manmohan Singh himself appeared as his own witness as PW-1. He examined Dr.Ajay Alex of CMC Hospital, Ludhiana as PW2, Vinod Kumar Cashier CMC Hospital, Ludhiana as PW3, Dr.Ravinder Kuamr, Ortho Surgeon as PW4 and Counsel for the claimant closed the evidence of the claimant. The Counsel for respondent No.2 tendered into evidence document Ex.R1 regarding verification of the driving licence, Copy of insurance cover was tendered into evidence as Ex.PX by the Counsel for the claimant in view of no objection raised by the learned Counsel for the respondent. The respondents did not adduce other evidence and failed to pay the costs, therefore lost their right to lead further evidence. 8.I have heard Sh.L.C.Bector Adv.,Counsel for the claimant; Sh.Satinderbir Singh Adv.,Counsel for the respondent No.1 and Sh.G.S.Kalyan, Adv.,Counsel for the respondent No.2 and have gone Page: 6 Manmohan Singh vs. Manmeet Singh MACT No.87 of 10.12.2015 through the record with their able assistance. My issuewise findings are as under: Issues No.1 and 2: 9.Being interconnected and interlinked, both these issues are taken up together for discussion. 10.The learned Counsel for the claimant has contended that in the accident which took place because of rash and negligent driving of the offending car by respondent No.1, the claimant suffered grievous injuries. He also remained admitted in hospital, suffered pain and agony and suffered loss of income, therefore the compensation sought for may be granted. 11.The learned Counsel for the respondent No.2 has contended that the accident has not been proved. Therefore, the claimant is not entitled to any claim. The learned Counsel for respondent No.1 contended that if the Tribunal assesses the compensation payable by the respondents, the vehicle being insured, the respondent No.2 is either to reimbu4rse the said compensation if recovered from the respondent No.1 or has to pay at its own. 12.The claimant Manmohan Singh when appeared when appeared as his own witness as PW1, has deposed by way of his Affidavit Ex.PA whereby he has reiterated and reasserted his entire pleaded case which for the sake of brevity and to avoid repetition, may be omitted to be mentioned here again in detail. He deposed regarding mode and manner of the accident, injuries suffered by him and the amount spent by him on Page: 7 Manmohan Singh vs. Manmeet Singh MACT No.87 of 10.12.2015 his treatment. 13.Dr.Ajay Alex PW2 has deposed regarding the treatment of the claimant. He deposed that it was a case of alleged history of road traffic accident and the claimant was admitted in CMC Hospital on 14.8.2015. Three operations were conducted upon him. He was discharged on 27.8.2015. He has not been completely recovered from the injuries. He also deposed that the main injury was on the left foot of Manmohan Singh who paid Rs.64076/- to the hospital vide Ex.P3. He also brought the record regarding payment of Rs.39584/- vide Ex.P2 on the second treatment and the Discharge Summary Ex.P96 and Ex.P97. 14.Vinod Kumar Cashier of the CMC Hospital, Ludhiana was examined as CW3 who has proved the bills Ex.P3 and Ex.P4 for the amount of Rs.64076/- and Rs.39,584/- respectively and proved Ex.P4, Ex.P5 to Ex.P57 being bills issued by their hospital. 15.Dr.Davinder Kumar, Ortho Surgeon PW4 has deposed that claimant was having permanent disability to the extent of 2%. The PW4 being member of the Board, who examined the claimant, has proved the disability certificate as Ex.P96. 16.Merely because the FIR has not been registered, is no ground to throw away the claim petition of the claimant. The claimant vide Ex.P1 which is copy of the application having been dispatched to the SHO, P.S. Model Town, Ludhiana vide receipt Ex.P2 brought the fact of accident to the notice of the police. If the police has not registered the case, the claimant cannot be held to be at fault. Not only it, when the claimant Page: 8 Manmohan Singh vs. Manmeet Singh MACT No.87 of 10.12.2015 went to the CMC Hospital and was treated by the PW2 Dr.Ajay Alex, the hospital, as admitted by the said witness Dr.Ajay Alex PW2, sent the mandatory message to the police through wireless but nobody came to the hospital. Further more, the respondent No.1 in the written statement in Para No.24 has mentioned that the accident took place due to the negligence of the claimant himself, meaning thereby the accident has been admitted by the owner and driver of the offending car but he did not step into witness box to depose in support of his pleadings. The driver of the vehicle i.e. respondent No.1 was the best person who could reveal the truth of the accident but he was not examined by the respondents. He could not dare to come into witness box and deny the accident. The adverse inference is thus required to be drawn against him. For this principle, I am fortified with the pronouncements “Sheela Devi and others Versus Jayati Parshad and others, II (1995) ACC 240” as well as “National Insurance Company Limited Versus Sanjay Kumar & Ors., Vol.II (2011) ACC 75” of the Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court. The claimant has thus proved on record that accident took place because of rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by the respondent No.1 wherein the claimant suffered injuries. It is thus held that the accident in question took place because of the rash and negligent driving of the offending car by the respondent No.1 and in the said accident, the claimant has suffered injuries. 17. So far as the claim of the claimant is concerned, the offending vehicle was insured with the respondent No.2. The accident took place on Page: 9 Manmohan Singh vs. Manmeet Singh MACT No.87 of 10.12.2015 14.8.2015. As per Ex.PX, the Certificate cum Insurance Schedule, the insurance commenced from 00:00 A.M. 25 Nov.2014 to midnight of 24 Nov.2015. The accident took place within the validity period of insurance. Ex.R1 tendered into evidence of the respondent No.1 reveals that the licence of Manmeet Sigh driver of the offending vehicle was got verified and was found to be correct. Therefore, if the compensation amount is recovered from the respondent No.1, the respondent No.2 is liable to reimburse the same. Thus the liability to pay the compensation amount to be assessed hereinafter, of the respondents No.1 and 2, shall be joint and several. 18.The bills regarding treatment, proof regarding admission and discharge, have been produced on record by the claimant as Ex.P3 to Ex.P97. The details of these bills have been prepared by the claimant and placed on record. It was checked and found to be correct by the Counsel for the respondent No.2 who also appended his signautres on the said list in token of its correctness. The amount of these bills is calculated to be .2,04,132/- which has been found to be correct by the Counsel for the₹ respondent No.2. The conducting of operations upon the claimant as a part of his treatment, his admission and discharge and the amount spent by him in the hospital, has been proved by PW2 Dr.Ajay Alex, PW3 Vinod Kumar and PW4 Dr.Davinder Kumar. The claimant thus obviously suffered pain, suffering and agony; and he remained off from his occupation; obviously required special diet during the period of his treatment and may have taken the help of the attendant. For all these non Page: 10 Manmohan Singh vs. Manmeet Singh MACT No.87 of 10.12.2015 pecuniary damages, the compensation amount is assessed to be ₹ 50,000/- (fifty thousand). 19.So far as the 2% disability is concerned, the claimant could not establish that it happened due to the injuries because PW2 Dr.Ajay Alex, who treated him, has categorically admitted that their hospital has not assessed the permanent disability after discharge nor the claimant had given any written request for the same. The disability is of left lower limb. The Discharge Summary dated 14.8.2015 was not provided to PW4 as admitted by him during cross-examination. Disability was due to impact of injury, is not established. Therefore, the compensation is assessed to be .2,04,132/- + 50,000/- = ₹ ₹ 2,54,132/- (Two lacs, fifty four thousand,₹ one hundred and thirty two rupees only). The claimant is entitled to recover this amount from the respondents No.1 and 2 jointly and severally. The liability of the respondents No.1 and 2 to make the payment shall be joint and several. Both these issues are thus decided in favour of the claimant. Issue No.3: 20.The onus of this issue was on the respondents. In view of the findings returned on the issues No.1 and 2, the Court is of the opinion that the claim petition filed by the claimant seeking compensation on account of injuries suffered by him in a motor vehicle accident is duly maintainable in the present form and the respondents have failed to prove as to how the petition is not maintainable. Accordingly, this issue is Page: 11 Manmohan Singh vs. Manmeet Singh MACT No.87 of 10.12.2015 decided in favour of the claimant and against the respondents. Issue No.4: 21.This issue was abandoned by the respondent with the same convenience with which it was taken. Even otherwise, Ex.R1, copy of verification of driving licence No.PB10 1996 0344228 in the name of Manmeet Singh respondent No.1 is valid from 9.5.2015 to 8.5.2020. This issue is thus decided against the respondent and in favour of the claimant. Issue No.5: 22.This issue was not pressed during the course of arguments. Accordingly, the same is decided against the respondents and in favour of the claimant. Relief 23.As a result of the above findings on the above issues, the claim petition is allowed against the respondents No.1 and 2. The Award is thus passed for the recovery of 2,54,132/- (Two lacs, fifty four thousand,₹ one hundred and thirty two rupees only) against the respondents No.1 and 2. The liability of the respondents No.1 and 2 to make the payment of compensation amount shall be joint and several. The respondents No.1 and 2 are directed to pay the aforesaid amount to the claimant within two months from today, failing which the claimant shall also be entitled to get the interest @ 9% P.A from the date of institution of the present claim Page: 12 Manmohan Singh vs. Manmeet Singh MACT No.87 of 10.12.2015 petition till the realisation of the compensation amount.

Raj Rani & Others Vs. Gurmeet Singh & Another -3- 3.Notice of the claim petition was given to the respondents. The respondent no.1 filed written statement and raised preliminary objection that the claim petition is not maintainable. The claimants have not come to the court with clean hands and have suppressed the material facts from the court. 4.Respondent no.2 has filed separate written statement and raised preliminary objections that the claim petition is not maintainable in the present form. It has further been pleaded that no document has been brought on record to show that offending vehicle bearing no.PB-10- EH(T)-8277 caused the alleged accident. It has further pleaded that answering respondent is not responsible for any compensation as respondent no.1 ie driver/owner of the offending vehicle was not holding a valid and effective driving license at the time of accident. On merits all the averments have been denied and prayer for dismissal of the claim petition has been made. 5. Rejoinder not filed. From the pleadings of the parties following issues were framed:- (i) Whether Tarsem Lal died on 08.07.2014 in the area of Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar, Ludhiana in an accident on account of rash and negligent driving of car bearing registration no.PB-10-EH(T)-8277 by respondent no.1?

OPR (v) Whether petition is bad for non-joinder and mis-joinder of the parties? OPR (vi) Whether the claimants have not come to the court with clean hands? OPR (vii) Relief 6.Since onus to prove main issues was upon the claimants, so he was called upon to lead evidence in the first go. During this process, first of claimant Raj Rani widow of deceased Tarsem Lal herself stepped into the witness box as CW-1 and deposed through sworn affidavit Ex-PA/1 and tendered Medical Treatment record of deceased Tarsem Lal as Ex.C-1, death certificate of deceased Tarsem Lal as Ex.C-2 and Agreement Mark A. Thereafter, she examined Manohar Lal as CW-2 who deposed through sworn affidavit Ex-PA/2. She further examined Paramjit Kaur as CW-3 who deposed through sworn affidavit Ex.PA/3. Claimant after tendered into evidence documents Ex.C-1 Panchayati Compromise (Ex.C-1 again exahibited by same number), Ex.C-2 admission of deceased Tarsem Lal in Civil Hospital, Ludhiana, Ex.C-3 application to CMO, Civil Hospital, Ludhiana regarding fitness of deceased Tarsem Lal and Ex.C-4 statement of deceased Tarsem Lal closed the evidence of claimants. On the other hand, respondent no.1 (driver/owner of the offending vehicle) stepped into the witness box as RW-1 and deposed through sworn affidavit Ex.RA. He after tendered Raj Rani & Others Vs. Gurmeet Singh & Another -5- into evidence documents Ex.R-1 RC of the offending vehicle and Ex.R-2 copy of Insurance Policy closed the his evidence. 7.This is a claim petition U/s 166 of Motor Vehicle Act, which constitute special provisions for payment of compensation. In this case the victim or the claimant have an option to claim compensation either U/s 140 or U/s 166 of this Act in case of death or permanent disablement as the case may be. The liability determined by claim authority is based upon the principles of natural justice adjudicating upon the issues of respective faults. Loss of earning capacity of the victim at the time of accident is also considered and kept in view. 8.I have heard the contentions put forth by counsel for parties and also gone through the record with their able assistance and my issue wise findings are as under : ISSUE NO.4. 9.Ld counsel for respondnt no.2 filed an application on 06.02.2016 for supply of copy of Insurance Policy, registration certificate and driving license of respondent no.1. Respondent no.1 filed reply to the said application. Respondent no.1 failed to produce the driving license on record. Therefore, this court has taken an adverse inference against respodent no.1 that he has not a valid driving license. Accordingly, issue no.4 is decided in favour of respondent no.2 and against respondent no.1. ISSUE NO.3, 5 & 6 10.Respondents did not press these issues during the course of arguments as such these are decided in favor of claimants and against Raj Rani & Others Vs. Gurmeet Singh & Another -6- respondents. ISSUE NO.1 & 2 11.Both these issues are taken together being interconnected and inter-related. Onus to prove these issues was upon claimants and in this regard claimant Raj Rani herself stepped into the witness box as CW-1 and deposed through her sworn affidavit Ex-CA and stated on solemn affirmation and r eiterated the entire version of plaint that how the alleged accident took place in which her husband Tarsem Lal had died. She further deposed that deceased was under treatment from 08.07.2014 to 28.07.2014 and died during the treatment. Rs.4,00,000/- was spent on his medical treatment, transportation of body of the deceased for last rites. She further deposed that deceased was hale and hearty and was rehra puller through horse and was earning about Rs.40,000/- per month. She further deposed that respondent Gurmeet Singh had entered into panchayati compromise with them which was executed in the house of Ex-MLA and was scribed by HC Gurpreet Singh no.2776, P.S Sarabha Nagar, Ludhiana which was proved by her on record as Mark A wherein respondent no.1 Gurmeet Singh agreed to pay the expenses of medical treatment of deceased Tarsem Lal. Continuing further, she has examined Manohar Lal as CW-2, Manohar Lal was one of the witness of Panchayati compromise Ex.C-1 (again exhibited as Ex.C-1) and he has duly proved the panchayati compromise. Paramjit Kaur as CW-3 who have corroborated the entire version of CW-1. All these witnesses were duly cross-examined by learned counsel for respondents no.1 & 2. During the course of cross Raj Rani & Others Vs. Gurmeet Singh & Another -7- examination, nothing advantageous could be elicited from their mouth which could be beneficial to the respondents. On the other hand, respondent no.1 Gurmeet Singh stepped into the witness box as RW-1 and deposed through his duly sworn affidavit Ex.RA. He stated that the actual registration number of the offending vehicle is PB-10-EN-6065. He also placed on record copy of RC as Ex.R-1. He also placed on record copy of Insurance Policy as Ex.R-2. During cross examination he admitted the fact he has not placed on record copy of his driving license valid on 08.07.2014 to drive the vehicle bearing no.PB-10-EN- 6065. The said witness of respondent is not sufficient to rebut the case of claimants. CW-1 Raj Rani and CW-2 Manohar Lal fully proved the accident by panchayati compromise Ex.C-1 caused by respondent no.1 while driving the offending vehilce rashly and negligently without blowing any horn. The evidence, adduced on record, by the claimants, as discussed above, has gone un-rebutted and unchallenged qua respondent no.1 (owner and driver) of the offending vehicle. Thence, as a result of aforesaid discussion, the issue no.1 & 2 are decided accordingly in favour of claimants and against respondents no.1 & 2. 12.Averting to the quantum of compensation to be awarded to the claimants. The claimants have claimed Rs.20,00,000/- as compensation. It was only with a sole object to bring about uniformity & consistency in awarding compensation that Hon'ble Apex Court of India gave clear cut directions to various Tribunals/Courts working throughout length & breadth of this country to work on various determining factors. Hon'ble apex Court while making above said Raj Rani & Others Vs. Gurmeet Singh & Another -8- observations in a celebrated judgment titled Sarla Verma and others versus Delhi Transport Corporation & Others 2009 ACJ 1298 , culled the observations made by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Trilok Chandra's case as follows : “We thought it necessary to reiterate the method of working out 'just' compensation because, of late, we have noticed from the awards made by Tribunals and Courts that the principle on which the multiplier method was developed has been lost sight of and once again a hybrid method based on the subjectivity of Tribunal/court has surfaced, introducing uncertainty and lack of reasonable uniformity in the matter of determination of compensation. It must be realized that the Tribunal/Court has to determine a fair amount of compensation awardable to the victim of an accident which must be proportionate to the injury caused”. 13.Claimants have claimed compensation to the tune of Rs.20,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty Lacs only). This is how in this exercise various steps are required to be taken by the Tribunal very well spelt out by the Hon'ble Court in the above stated decision. As per the guidelines prescribed therein, three steps are to be followed for determining the exact amount of compensation. In step No.1 the income of the deceased is to be determined out of which the deduction is to be made which the deceased would have spent on himself or herself by way of personal expenses. Basically, the Tribunal had to look out three things which of course are required to be established by the claimant party. These are : age of the deceased, income of the Raj Rani & Others Vs. Gurmeet Singh & Another -9- deceased and number of dependents. In addition to this, Tribunal has also to determine the loss of dependency and it has to work out the same after taking into consideration additions/deductions to be made to find out the income of the deceased. Further the deductions to be made towards the personal and living expenses of the deceased and finally multiplier to be applied in reference with the age of the deceased. It was also with an object to standardize all these determinants that Hon'ble Supreme Court had laid out entire criteria so as to bring about uniformity in the awards passed by the various Tribunals across the country in motor accident claims cases. In order to arrive at exact amount, three steps are adopted by the Tribunal. In step No.1 multiplicand is to be ascertained and for doing so the income of the deceased per annum is calculated after deducting income tax out of which other deductions to be made in regard to the amount which the deceased would have spent for personal and living expenses and balance was to be contributed towards all the dependents of the family members. In second step multiplier is to be ascertained and for this purpose also the learned Apex Court laid out detailed criteria depending upon the age of the deceased based upon the number of years he would have lived or worked but for unfortunate accident and then final step is to calculate the actual compensation. 14.Applying this yardstick to the facts & circumstances of the instant claim petition, claimant has claimed was 65 years old. As per Ex.C-1 age of the deceased is mentioned as 65 years old. In the given circumstances, I take his age as 65 years on the date of his death. In Raj Rani & Others Vs. Gurmeet Singh & Another -10- that event, the suitable multiplier would be 7. 15.Further if we take into consideration various averments the deceased was stated to be working as cart puller (rehra puller) and earns Rs.30,000/- per month working as cart puller. In order to prove his earnings from the working as cart puller claimant did not tender any document which shows that deceased Tarsem Lal was self employed and was earning Rs.30,000/- per month. Claimant examined Manohar Lal and Paramjit Kaur as CW-2 and CW-3 respectively who reiterated the entire version of plaint and also deposed regarding the working of deceased Tarsem Lal and was earning Rs.30,000/- per month. Thus, I take the monthly income of deceased as Rs.8000/- (un-skilled) as if he had been earning by doing the work of cart puller. Deceased is survived by his LRs namely wife, one daughter and two sons . In this back drop, 1/4th of income of deceased is liable to be deducted as personal and living expenses. 16.It will be just and fair and equitable in the absence of evidence to the contrary for higher expenses to award at least a sum of Rs.25,000/- as funeral expenses. Moreover, Hon'ble Lordships have also held that consortium is the right of the spouse to the company, care, help, comfort, guidance, society, solace, affection and sexual relations with his or her mate. Therefore, it would be appropriate for the Courts to award at least Rs.1,00,000/- for loss of consortium. 17.Finally, the following calculation will give us amount of compensation to be awarded to the claimants : Raj Rani & Others Vs. Gurmeet Singh & Another -11- S.No. HEADS CALCULATION (i) Salary/earning Rs.8000/- per month + 20% future prospectus =Rs.9600/- per month. (ii) 1/4th deducted as personal expenses of the deceasedRs.9600/- minus Rs. 2400/- = Rs. 7200/- per month. (iv) Compensation after multiplier of 7 is appliedRs.6,04,800/- (v) Loss of consortiumRs. 01,00,000/- (vi) Funeral expensesRs.25,000-00 (vii) Love & Affection to childrenRs. 50,000/- each (three children) (viii) Total Rs. 8,79,800/- 18. In view of above discussion, issue under discussion is held in favour of claimants to the extent stated above. RELIEF 19. In view of my findings upon the above said issues, present claim petition succeeds with costs and claimants are awarded compensation to the tune of Rs.8,79,800/- along with interest rate @ 7.5% from the date of filing claim petition ie 02.02.2015 till the decision of the case, to be paid by respondent no.2 Insurance Company. Since respondent no.1 has failed to produce the driving licence of offending vehicle, it is held that respondent no.2 being insurance company shall pay the compensation amount to claimants, but if so advised, it shall be at liberty to recover the same from respondent no.1 for having violated the terms and conditions of insurance policy. This amount is to be paid by the Insurance company within two months from the receipt of Raj Rani & Others Vs. Gurmeet Singh & Another -12- Award failing which claimants are also entitled future interest at the rate of 6% per annum, till the realization of total amount. The Award amount shall be apportioned amongst the claimants as under:- (i) Claimant No.1 = ( 70 % ) (ii) Claimant No.2 = ( 10 %) (iii) Claimant no.3 = ( 10 %) (iv) Claimant no.4 = ( 10 %) 20.In view of latest decision in Civil Revision No.7407 of 2010 by the Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court dated 03.06.2011 in case 'Jyoti Burmi Vs. Anusandeep Burmi' , now it is desirable that if claimants have any account in the Bank, then they will intimate to this court within one month and by way of notice to the respondents after receipt of certified copy of judgment. After this compliance, respondent no.2 is ordered to pay the award amount directly in the account of claimants no.1 to 4 by way of RTGS or by way of draft or cross cheque so that cumbersome procedure of deposit and withdrawal from the court could be avoided by both the parties to save their own time as well as precious time of the court. 21.Counsel fee is assessed Rs.1,000/-.

Kalyan, Advocate for the respondent no.4 Respondent no.5, exparte 2 AWARD Through the present petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act, the claimants are seeking compensation on account of death of Kulwant Singh, who died in a motor vehicular accident, which took place on 13.10.2015 in the village Salempur, Police Station Laddowal, District Ludhiana, due to rash and negligent driving of Toyota Innova bearing registration number PB-30-L-5633 by respondent no.1. 2.The facts, as put forth by the claimants, are to the effect that on 13.10.2015, the deceased along with his wife Kiranjit Kaur were going from their house to shop at village Hambran in their car make Swift Dzire bearing registration number PB-10-CP-8773. At about 10:30 A.M., when they reached in village Salempur, Ludhiana, then one Innova Car bearing registration number PB-30-L-5633 being driven by respondent no.1 in a rash and negligent manner and at a very high speed without blowing horn came from Hambran side and struck against the car of the deceased. Due to the impact of the accident, Kulwant Singh came out of the driver seat and fell down on the road in front of the car. As a result whereof, the deceased Kulwant Singh and his wife Kiranjit Kaur suffered multiple and grievous injuries. As a result of injuries, Kulwant Singh died at the spot whereas his wife Kiranjit Kaur was taken in an Ambulance and was got admitted in D.M.C. and hospital, Ludhiana for treatment. She also succumbed to the accidental injuries. Talwant Singh is eye witness to the accident and an FIR No.216 dated 13.10.2015 under Sections 279, 337, 338, 427 and 304-A of IPC was registered at Police Station Laddowal against respondent no.1 on his statement. It has been alleged that the 3 deceased was aged about 50 years at the time of accident and was businessman and he was running his own Jewellery shop under the name and style of M/s Kamal Jewellers at Hambran, District Ludhiana, and he was earning a handsome amount of Rs.2,17,960/- per annum from this avocation. It has been further alleged that the deceased was an income tax assessee and he was filing regular Income Tax Returns with the Income Tax Department. The deceased was very sincere and hardworking and devoted to work and he was expected to expand his business in near future. The deceased was having his family consisting of his mother, father, wife and minor children at the time of his death who were fully dependent upon the deceased. It is submitted that all the day to day needs and necessities of life of the claimants including medical needs etcetera were being met by the deceased and the deceased was the only ray of hope for the claimants and he was utilizing his entire earnings for the welfare of his family including the claimants. The claimants were fully dependent upon the deceased. Due to the untimely death of the deceased, the entire family has been shattered and come on the road and the future of the claimants has become dark. Due to sudden death of the deceased, the claimant no.1 and 2 have lost their loving son, whereas claimant no.3 to 6 lost their loving father. The loss suffered by the claimants cannot be calculated in terms of money. The deceased was having dream to provide best possible education to the claimant no.3 to 6 and to marry claimant no.3 to 5 in a noble family and settle the claimants in his life. Accordingly, compensation to the tune of Rs.75,00,000/- has been sought in the claim petition. 4 3.In pursuance of the notice, the respondents appeared through counsels and through the written reply filed by respondent no.1 he has alleged that the accident took place with the rash and negligent driving of the deceased Kulwant Singh, who was driving a Swift Dzire Car bearing registration number PB-10-CP-8773 and struck his car against the front side of the vehicle of the respondent no.1 after coming from wrong side and the deceased also seems to be in a drunkard condition while driving. It is further submitted that the accident has not taken place due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1. In fact in the said accident respondent no.1 received serious injuries and he remained hospitalized for 11 days and the respondent no.1 has spent huge amount of Rs.2 lacs on his treatment. On merits, the material averments put forth by the claimants have been denied. 4.Respondent no.4 through written reply has raised the preliminary objections disputing the maintainability of the claim petition. It has been alleged that the claim petition is bad for non-joinder and mis- joinder of necessary parties. The accident if any that took place it was due to the rash and negligent driving of car bearing registration number PB- 30-L-5633 driven by Angrej Singh, as such claim petition against respondent no.4 is liable to be dismissed. It is submitted that the respondent no.4 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimants as driver of Swift Dzire car bearing registration number PB-10-CP-8773 did not have valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident which is clear violation of the terms and conditions of the policy. It is further submitted that the Swift Dzire car bearing registration number PB- 5 10-CP-8773 did not have the valid registration certificate, at the time of alleged accident which amounts to breach of the terms of policy, thus, the respondent no.4 is not liable to pay any compensation. It is further submitted that the claimants have not furnished their residence proof, identity proof and Pan Card of the deceased and the claimants legal heirs certificate, an affidavit to the effect that they have not filed or received any other claim on the same cause of action to show that the claimants are legally entitled to file the present claim petition. On merits, it has been alleged that no accident took place as alleged and no copy of FIR is supplied to the respondent no.4. However, it has not been disputed that the Swift Dzire car bearing registration number PB-10-CP-8773 was insured with respondent no.4 at the time of alleged accident. 5.Upon notice initially respondent no.5 appeared in person but later on left the proceedings of the court and as such he was proceeded against exparte vide order dated 18.04.2016. 6.From the perusal of pleadings and documents, the following issues were framed:- 1.Whether deceased Kulwant Singh died in motor a motor vehicle accident caused by the respondent no.1 while driving Toyota Innova car bearing registration no.PB- 30L-5633 in rash and negligent manner? OPA 2.Whether claimants are entitled to compensation, if so to what amount? OPA 3.Whether driver of Swift car no.PB-10CP-8773 was not holding valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident? OPR4 4.Whether the respondent no.1 was not holding valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident? OPR4 5.Whether the Swift car no.PB-10CP-8773 was not holding valid and effective registration certificate at the time of accident? OPR4 6 6.Relief 7.In support of their allegations, the claimants have examined claimant no.1 Pritam Kaur (CW-1), Talwant Singh (CW-2) who is the eye witness to the accident and author of the FIR (Ex.C1) and Harbans Singh (CW-3) brother of the deceased Kulwant Singh, who also proved attested copy of FIR (Ex.C1), attested copy of post mortem of deceased Kulwant Singh (Ex.C2), attested copy of Income Tax Return for the assessment year 2014-2015 (Ex.C3), computation chart for the said year (Ex.C4), Income Tax Return for the assessment year 2013-2014 (Ex.C5), computation chart (Ex.C6), Income tax return for the year 2012-2013 (Ex.C7), computation chart of the said year (Ex.C8), school certificates of claimants no.3 to 6 (Ex.C9 to Ex.C11), attested copy of PAN card of deceased Kulwant Singh (Ex.C12), Driving Licence of deceased Kulwant Singh (Ex.C13), Aadhar car of Kulwant Singh (Ex.C14), death certificate of deceased Kulwant Singh (Ex.C15), death certificate of claimant Arjan Singh (Ex.C16), who died during the pendency of this claim petition, joint photo of claimants (Ex.C17), copy of RC of Maruti Swift Dzire number PB-10-CP-8773 (Ex.C18), attested copy of letter dated 20.03.2015 issued by Kotak Mahindra Prime Limited (Ex.C19), statement of account (Ex.C20), showing that deceased was paying installment of Rs.11,280/- per month regularly to the bank. Claimants have also examined Raju Kumar Soni (CW-4) Senior TA, Income Tax Department, who proved income tax returns for the assessment years 2012-2013, 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 from Ex.CW4/1 to Ex.CW4/3, copy of CBN PAN based query 7 of deceased Kulwant Singh (Ex.CW4/4). Thereafter learned counsel for the claimants closed the evidence. 8.On the other hand respondent no.1 and 2 did not lead any evidence and the learned counsel appearing on their behalf closed the evidence. 9.Learned counsel for respondent no.4 tendered into evidence original registration certificate verification of Dzire car bearing registration number PB-10-CP-8773 (Ex.R1), original driving licence verification of Kulwant Singh (Ex.R2) and insurance policy of said car (Ex.R3). Thereafter respondent no.4 closed the evidence. 10.I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record. My findings on the aforesaid issues are as under:- Issue no.1 11.Onus to prove this issue was upon the claimants and in order to prove the same. The claimants have put forth a case to the effect that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No.1. As per the version of the claimants, the deceased along with his wife Kiranjit Kaur were going from their house to shop at village Hambran in their car make Swift Dzire bearing registration no.PB-10CP-8773 on 13.10.2015. When they reached in village Salempur, Ludhiana, at about 10.30 A.M., the offending vehicle Innova Car bearing Registration number PB-30-L-5633 being driven rashly and negligently by respondent no.1 came from the opposite side and struck with the car on which Kulwant Singh and his wife Kiranjit Kaur were travelling. As a result of which, both the occupants sustained multiple and 8 grievous injuries. Kulwant Singh deceased died at the spot, whereas his wife Kiranjit Kaur due to grievous injuries was taken to DMC and Hospital, Ludhiana, for treatment where she also died later on. 12.Talwant Singh (CW-2) an eye-witness to the accident has deposed that he was following the deceased on his separate car bearing registration number PB-10-DP-0468. While appearing in the witness box he has testified with regard to the mode and manner in which the accident took place. An FIR, copy whereof is Ex.C1, was also lodged at P.S. Laddowal at his instance. FIR has been lodged on the following day of occurrence. There is nothing on record to indicate that any false, coloured or concocted version has been introduced in the FIR. 13.Pritam Kaur (CW-1) mother of the deceased Kulwant Singh also has deposed that deceased Kulwant Singh died in a road accident which took place on 13.10.2015 due to sole rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 Angrej Singh, driver of Innova Car number PB-30-L- 5633. 14.Respondent no.1 driver and respondent no.2 owner of the Innova Car bearing registration number PB-30-L-5633 did not dare to appear in the witness box to rebut the testimonies of the witnesses of the claimants for the reasons best known to them. The driver of the offending vehicle was the best person to deny the accident that he was not involved in this accident. For the non appearance of the respondent no.1 driver and respondent no.2 owner, an adverse inference is required to be drawn against them and in favour of the claimants that their claim has got merits. 9 Reliance in this regard is placed on decisions cited as Bhagwanti Devi versus Krishan Kumar Saini and others, 1986 A.C.J. 331 and Laxmi and Company versus Savitri Devi Aggarwal and others, 1990 A.C.J. 450 . 15.However, the learned counsel for the respondent no.1 and 2 argued that Kulwant Singh driver of the Swift Dzire car bearing registration number PB-10-CP-8773 struck his car in the front side of the vehicle of the respondent no.1 after coming from wrong side and said Kulwant Singh also seems to be in drunkard condition while driving. Moreover, respondent no.1 also received grievous injuries and he was hospitalized for 11 days and he had spent huge amount of Rs. 2 lacs on his treatment. But this argument of learned counsel for the respondent no.1 and 2 is without any merit because no evidence in this regard either in the shape of oral as well as documentary has not been brought on record from where it could be ascertained that at the time of accident Kulwant Singh was in a drunkard condition while driving and the accident caused due to wrong side driving of said Kulwant Singh. Further no medical document has been proved on file in the shape of bills or discharge summary of any hospital from which it could be ascertained that respondent no.1 had also received grievous injuries in the said accident and admitted in any hospital for his treatment as alleged. 16.It was for the contesting respondents to explain away that no such accident took place much less than the negligence and rash driving of respondent no.1. Otherwise also, there is no reason with eye witness to depose falsely or implicate the respondent no.1 driver and to allow the 10 actual culprit to go free. In case cited National Insurance Company Limited versus Sanjay Kumar, II (2011) ACC 75 , it has been held that, “When driver of offending vehicle is facing criminal trial , prima facie it can be presumed that he was responsible for accident. ”It is pertinent to observe that the degree of proof required for proving the negligence on the part of the driver in the present proceedings, is not as vigorous as is required in proving the guilt of the accused in criminal trial. The intent of the present legislation is benevolent and the entire purpose of the legislation is likely to be defeated if in each case the claimant is asked to prove beyond reasonable doubt the involvement and negligence on the part of the driver. In reaching to the above opinion, I am guided by the judgment of Kaushnuma Begum and others Versus New India Assurance Limited, 2001 ACJ 421 SC as well as the case reported as National Insurance Company Limited Versus Pushpa Rana, 2009 ACJ 289, wherein it is held that mere involvement of a vehicle is sufficient to establish and hold the claim petition to be maintainable. It is held that even the certified copy of charge-sheet may not be asked for if the claimant is able to satisfy on record the involvement of the offending vehicle through the copy of FIR. The collective reading of the documentary and oral evidence brought on record reflect sufficient material to hold that it was the driver who was involved in the accident. In such circumstances, I am of the view that the claimants have discharged the onus. 17.Thus, in view of the above, it stands proved that deceased Kulwant Singh died in an accident that took place on 13.10.2015 arising 11 out of use of Innova Car bearing registration number PB-30-L-5633 due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1 driver of the said car. This issue is accordingly decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. Issue No.2 18.The claimants have put forth a case to the effect that the deceased was aged about 38 years. No birth certificate indicating the date of birth of the deceased has been placed on record. However, on the PAN card issued by the Income Tax Department as well as on the Driving Licence the date of birth of deceased Kulwant Singh has been mentioned as 01.09.1977, which have been proved as Ex.C12 and Ex.C13. Thus, the age of the deceased has to be construed as 37 years. 19.With regard to avocation of the deceased, the claimants have put forth a case to the effect that he was businessman and he was running his own Jeweller shop under the name and style of M/s Kamal Jewellers at Hambran, District Ludhiana, and he was earning a handsome amount of Rs.2,17,960/- per annum from this vocation. In support thereof claimant no.1 Pritam Kaur (CW-1) has deposed that deceased Kulwant Singh was running his own Jewellery shop under the name and style of M/s Kamal Jewellers at Hambran, District Ludhiana and he was earning a handsome amount of Rs.4,00,000/- per annum from this vocation. 20.Harbans Singh (CW-3) brother of the deceased, has deposed that deceased Kulwant Singh was running his own Jewellery shop under the name and style of M/s Kamal Jewellers at Hambran, District Ludhiana, and he was earning a handsome amount of Rs.4,00,000/- per 12 annum from this vocation. He also has deposed that deceased was an Income Tax Assessee and he was filing regular Income Tax Returns with the Income Tax Department and his gross income for the assessment year 2014-2015 was Rs.2,35,852/-. In this regard he has proved attested copy of Income Tax Return for the assessment year 2014-2015 (Ex.C3), computation chart for the said year (Ex.C4), Income Tax Return for the assessment year 2013-2014 (Ex.C5), computation chart (Ex.C6), Income tax return for the year 2012-2013 (Ex.C7), computation chart of the said year (Ex.C8), attested copy of PAN card of deceased Kulwant Singh (Ex.C12). He further deposed that Kulwant Singh purchased the car after taking loan from Kotak Mahindra Prime Limited, Feroze Gandhi Market, Ludhiana, and he was paying equally monthly installments of Rs.11,280/- and in this regard he proved attested copy of letter dated 20.03.2015 issued by Kotak Mahindra Prime Limited (Ex.C19), statement of account (Ex.C20), showing that deceased was paying installment of Rs.11,280/- per month regularly to the bank. 21.Claimants have also examined CW-4 Raju Kumar Soni, Senior TA, Income Tax Department, who deposed that as per assessment year 2012-2013 the gross total income of deceased Kulwant Singh was Rs.1,86,500/-, as per assessment year 2013-2014 Rs.1,97,530/- and as per assessment year 2014-2015 was Rs.2,35,852/- and this witness has proved the above said documents from Ex.CW4/1 to Ex.CW4/3 and also proved copy of PAN card of deceased Kulwant Singh and copy of CBN PAN based query of deceased Kulwant Singh (Ex.CW4/4). 13 22.Learned counsel for the claimants argued that the deceased was assessed to income tax and was paying income tax which shows that the deceased was earning Rs.4,00,000/- per annum from his business and his income was increasing day by day. Therefore, in view of the earning capacity of the deceased, the claimants are entitled to compensation of Rs.75,00,000/-. In support of his contention learned counsel for the claimants has drawn the attention of the court towards copy of income tax returns for the assessment year 2012-2013, showing the gross total income of deceased Rs.1,86,500/-, as per assessment year 2013-2014 the gross total income of the deceased was Rs.1,97,530/- and as per assessment year 2014-2015 the gross total income of the deceased was Rs.2,35,852/- which have been proved on record as (Ex.CW4/1 to Ex.CW4/3) by examining PW4 Raju Kumar Soni, Senior TA of Income Tax Department. There is no rebuttal to the evidence to the income tax returns being filed by the deceased. Perusal of the returns for the assessment year 2013-2014 being filed by the deceased would reveals that the earnings of the deceased were around Rs.1,97,530/- per annum i.e. to say that the deceased was earning Rs.16,460/- per month and the earning of the deceased for the subsequent year i.e. 2014-2015 saw an increase and he was earning Rs.2,35,852/- per annum i.e. Rs.19,654/- per month. These were the income tax returns filed by the deceased, regarding which there is no rebuttal, when he was alive and never expected to have died so that his dependents would see this day. So authenticity is attached to these income tax returns and can certainly be made the basis to assess the income of the deceased. From the last income tax return filed by the 14 deceased his income by rounding off is assessed to be Rs.19,654/- per month. 23.In case titled as Rajesh and others versus Rajbir Singh and others 2013 (3) Civil Court Cases 15 (SC), it has been held that in case of self employed or a person of fixed wages, an addition of 50% to the actual income of the deceased if deceased was below 40 years of age has been directed after deduction of income tax if any. The above said income of the deceased is the actual income after deduction of income tax, as such 50% of the income is to be added on account of future prospects i.e. Rs.19,654 + Rs.9,827 = Rs.29, 481/-. As the number of the dependent family members are 6, therefore, after deducting 1/4th towards personal expenses of deceased i.e. Rs.7,370.25 per month his total income would come to be Rs.22,110.75. Multiplier of 15 will be applicable in this case. Therefore, the actual income of deceased comes to Rs.22,110.75 x 12 x 15 = Rs.39,79,935/-. In addition to this, the claimants are further awarded a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- as loss of estate and Rs.25,000/- for funeral expenses and Rs.1,00,000/- on account of loss of love and affection. Thus, in all, the claimants are held entitled to the total compensation of Rs.42,04,935/-. The driver respondent no.1 and owner respondent no.2 are primarily responsible to pay this compensation as the offending vehicle was not insured. Therefore, respondent no.1 and 2 are liable to pay the said amount to the claimants jointly and severally. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. 15 Issues No.3 to 5 24.The onus to prove all these issues was upon the respondent no.4. However, these issues were not pressed for at the time of arguments. Otherwise also respondent no.4 is the insurer of the Swift Dzire Car being driven by the deceased which is not found at fault in this accident. Therefore, there is no liability of the respondent no.4 These issues no.3 to 5, as such, are decided against the respondent no.4 and in favour of the claimants. Relief 25.In view of the findings returned on the aforesaid issues, the claim petition is accepted with costs and an award of Rs.42,04,935/- is passed in favour of the claimants and against the respondent no.1 and 2 Since the vehicle in question was not insured, as such respondent no.1 and 2 are legally liable and bound to pay the claim award. The claimants are further awarded interest at the rate of 6% per annum on the award amount from the date of petition till realization. The claimants shall share the amount of compensation in equal shares. Since claimant no.2 has died during the pendency of this petition, as such, his wife i.e. claimant no.1 shall get his share. Respective shares of minor claimant no.3 to 6 be deposited in some nationalized bank in the shape of FDRs till the concerned minor claimant attains majority. At the same time, however, the interest accrued on the said amount may be used for the upbringing and education expenses of the said minor claimant. Grandmother, guardian and next friend Smt. Pritam Kaur (claimant no.1) will be entitled to get the interest, if need be, so as to provide proper upbringing for the minor 16 claimants.

Parmar, Advocate for respondent no.1 and 2 Shri Vyom Bansal, Advocate for respondent no.3 AWARD Above named claimants have filed this claim petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, for the grant of compensation on account of death of deceased Avadh Kumar alias Avadh Bihari Ram in an accident that took place on 15.09.2014 at about 2 P.M. in the area of near Kirti Baba Mandir, Chandigarh-Ludhiana Road, Focal Point, Ludhiana. 2.It is submitted that on 15.09.2014 the deceased along with Raj Mangal son of Madan Prasad were going on Chandigarh-Ludhiana road towards Jamalpur side, on their separate bicycles. The deceased was ahead of Raj Mangal on his bicycle on the correct side of the road near Kacha berm. At about 2 P.M. when they reached near Kirti Baba Mandir on Chandigarh-Ludhiana road then a Tata 709 bearing registration number PB-10-AA-9591, being driven by respondent no.1, came from behind in rash and negligent manner at a very high speed and it without blowing any horn struck against the bicycle of the deceased. Due to that the deceased along with his bicycle fell down on the road and suffered multiple grievous injuries on his head and other parts of his body and succumbed to injuries suffered in the accident and his cycle was also totally damaged. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving by respondent no.1 Baldev Singh. Regarding this accident, FIR number 271 date 15.09.2014 was registered at Police Station Focal Point, Ludhiana, under Sections 279, 427 and 304-A of IPC. It is further averred that the deceased was 30 years of age at the time of his death. It is further submitted that the deceased was working as Helper in Avon Ispat and Power Limited, Focal Point, Phase-8, Chandigarh Road, Ludhiana, and his monthly income was Rs.7,238/- per month. It is further submitted that Rs.30,000/- were spent on the last rites and cremation of the deceased. It is further submitted that due to death of deceased claimant no.1 has lost her life companion, the claimant no.2 to 4 lost their father at such a young age and all the claimants were dependent upon the income of the deceased. It is prayed that compensation of Rs.30 Lac be granted to them. 3.Upon notice respondent no.1 and 2 appeared through counsel and filed written statement by taking the preliminary objections that no accident has occurred as alleged. On merit it is submitted that the false and frivolous FIR is registered and respondent no.1 and said vehicle has been falsely involved in this case. However, registration of FIR against respondent no.1 is admitted. All other material averments have been denied and prayer for dismissal of the petition has been made. 4.Respondent no.3 also appeared through counsel and filed separate written statement by taking preliminary objections that the claim petition is not maintainable as no cause of action arose to the claimants. The present petition has been filed by the claimants in connivance and collusion with other respondents to extract money from the Insurance Company. The vehicle in question bearing registration number PB-10- AA-9591 was not involved in the said accident and the same has been falsely implicated without any evidence and reason. The alleged FIR has not been lodged against the said vehicle and thus the respondent no.3 cannot be made liable to pay any compensation. The respondent no.3 has been made a party to the present petition but no policy issued for the vehicle in question, valid on the date of alleged accident issued by the respondent no.3, has been placed on record or supplied. Thus in such an event no liability to indemnify can be fastened upon the respondent no.3. If any policy is brought in the court after filing of the written statement then respondent no.3 shall not be liable unless the same is found to be free of any violations. The compensation, if any, has to be paid by respondent no.1 and 2 only. It is submitted that the respondent no.3 cannot be fastened with liability to indemnify the claimant on behalf of respondent no.2 as the person driving the vehicle in question at the time of alleged accident was not holding a valid and effective driving license to drive the class and category of the vehicle in the accident for which a special licence/endorsement is needed. The respondent no.2 had intentionally allowed the use of vehicle by a person not holding a valid driving license and permit. Therefore the liability of the respondent no.3 to indemnify the claimants ceases to exist. It is further submitted that there was no valid fitness and permit to ply the vehicle in question on the date of alleged accident. On merits all other averments have been denied and prayer for dismissal of the claim petition has been made. 5.From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed:- 1.Whether deceased Avadh Kumar died in a motor vehicle accident caused by respondent no.1 while driving TATA 709 bearing no.PB- 10-AA-9591 in rash and negligent manner? OPA 2.Whether the claimant is entitled to compensation, if so to what amount? OPA 3.Whether the respondent no.1 was not holding valid and effective permit at the time of alleged accident?OPR3 4.Whether the offending vehicle was not holding valid and effecting permit at the time of alleged accident?OPR3 5.Relief. 6.In order to prove their case the claimants have examined Raj Mangal (PW-1) on whose statement the FIR (Ex.P12) in the present case was registered, who proved attested copies of his driving licence and Aadhar Card (Ex.P1 and Ex.P2). Claimant Sheela Devi (PW-2) has proved attested copy of Aadhar Card (Ex.P3) and copy of Aadhar Card of deceased (Ex.P4). Claimants have also examined Yogesh (PW-3) Senior Officer, Avon Steel Industry (P) Limited, Focal Point, Ludhiana, who proved authority letter (Ex.P5), his identity card (Ex.P6), attested copies of attendance register showing the attendance of deceased (Ex.P7 and Ex.P8), salary certificate of deceased (Ex.P9), attested copy of salary register showing the salary of deceased Avadh Kumar for the month of August of year 2014 (Ex.P10) and for the month of September of year 2014 (Ex.P11). Learned counsel for the claimants also tendered into evidence attested copy of FIR (Ex.P12), certified copy of Postmortem Report (Ex.P13), attested copy of charge sheet (Ex.P14), date of birth of minors (Ex.P15 to Ex.P17) and closed the evidence on behalf of claimants. 7. On the other hand, respondent no.1 and 2 have not examined any evidence on their behalf and closed their evidence after tendering into evidence the original insurance policy (Ex.R1) and attested copy of Driving License of Baldev Singh (Ex.R2). Learned counsel for the respondent no.3 also tendered into evidence certified copy of Insurance Policy (Ex.R3/A) and closed the evidence. 8.I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the record. My issue wise findings are as under:- Issue no.1 9.Onus to prove this issue was upon the claimants and in order to prove the same, the claimants have relied upon the testimony of Raj Mangal (PW-1) who deposed that on 15.09.2014 he along with deceased was going on Chandigarh-Ludhiana road towards Jamalpur side, Ludhiana. Both were on there separate bicycles. The deceased was going ahead of him on his bicycle on the correct side of the road near Kacha Berm. At about 2 P.M. when they reached near Kirti Baba Mandir on Chandigarh-Ludhiana road, then a Tata 709 bearing registration number PB-10-AA-9591, being driven by respondent no.1, came from behind in rash and negligent manner on a very high speed and it without blowing any horn struck against the bicycle of the deceased and due to that the deceased along with his bicycle fell down on the road and suffered multiple grievous injuries on his head and other parts of his body and died at the spot due to injuries suffered in the accident. The bicycle of the deceased was totally damaged. He further deposed that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle TATA 709 bearing registration number PB-10-AA-9591 by respondent no.1 Baldev Singh and FIR no.271 dated 15.9.2014, under Section 269, 304A, 427 of IPC was registered at Police Station Focal Point, Ludhiana, on his statement against respondent no.1 Baldev Singh. 10.Claimant no.1 Sheela Devi (PW-2) deposed that deceased was her husband who died in a motor vehicle accident caused by respondent no.1 Baldev Singh. She deposed that her husband was 30 years old at the time of accident. He was working as helper in Avon Ispat and Power Limited, Focal Point, Phase-8, Chandigarh Road, Ludhiana, and was earning Rs.7,238/- per month. She further deposed that a sum of Rs.30,000/- was spent on the last rites of the deceased. She further deposed that now the they have no source of income and claimant no.2 to 4 are totally broken and shattered due to untimely death of deceased who was only bread winner of his family. 11.Respondent no.1 driver and respondent no.2 owner of the TATA-709 bearing registration number PB-10-AA-9591 did not dare to appear in the witness box to rebut the testimonies of the witnesses of the claimants for the reasons best known to them. The driver of the offending vehicle was the best person to deny the accident that he was not involved in this accident. For the non appearance of the respondent no.1 driver and respondent no.2 owner, an adverse inference is required to be drawn against them and in favour of the claimants that their claim has got merits. Reliance in this regard is placed on decisions cited as Bhagwanti Devi versus Krishan Kumar Saini and others, 1986 A.C.J. 331 and Laxmi and Company versus Savitri Devi Aggarwal and others, 1990 A.C.J. 450. 12.It was for the contesting respondents to explain away that no such accident took place much less than the negligence and rash driving of respondent no.1. In other words the contesting respondent insurance has also not challenged the authenticity of the FIR (Ex.P12). Otherwise also, there is no reason with eye witness to depose falsely or implicate the respondent no.1 driver and to allow the actual culprit to go free. It is pertinent to observe that the degree of proof required for proving the negligence on the part of the driver in the present proceedings, is not as vigorous as is required in proving the guilt of the accused in criminal trial. The intent of the present legislation is benevolent and the entire purpose of the legislation is likely to be defeated if in each case the claimants is asked to prove beyond reasonable doubt the involvement and negligence on the part of the driver. In reaching to the above opinion, I am guided by the judgment of Kaushnuma Begum and others Versus New India Assurance Limited, 2001 ACJ 421 SC as well as the case reported as National Insurance Company Limited Versus Pushpa Rana, 2009 ACJ 289, wherein it is held that mere involvement of a vehicle is sufficient to establish and hold the claim petition to be maintainable. It is held that even the certified copy of charge-sheet may not be asked for if the claimant is able to satisfy on record the involvement of the offending vehicle through the copy of FIR. The collective reading of the documentary and oral evidence brought on record reflect sufficient material to hold that it was the driver who was involved in the accident. In such circumstances, I am of the view that the claimants have discharged the onus. 13.Thus, in view of the above, it stands proved that deceased Avadh Kumar died in an accident that took place on 15.09.2014 arising out of use of TATA 709 bearing registration number PB-10-AA-9591 due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1 driver of the said vehicle. This issue is accordingly decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. Issue no.2 14.It has been pleaded by the claimants that the deceased was 30 years old at the time of his death. It is in the evidence of Rajmangal (PW-1) and Sheela Devi (PW-2) that deceased was working as helper in Avon Ispat (P) Limited, Ludhiana. In support thereof claimants have also examined Yogesh (PW-3), Senior Office of Avon Steel Industries, Private Limited, formerly known as Avon Ispat (P) Limited, Focal Point, Ludhiana, who brought the summoned record pertaining to deceased Avadh Kumar alias Avadh Bihari regarding his salary. He also brought the attendance register of his company and proved the attested copy of the same for the month of August of year 2014 and September of year 2014 (Ex.P7 and Ex.P8) showing the name of deceased Avadh Kumar in attendance register. He also brought the salary certificate of deceased Avadh Kumar (Ex.P9) issued by the above said company which shows that total salary of Avadh Kumar at the time of his death was ₹7,238/- per month. He also brought the original salary register of the above said company from the months of July of year 2014 to December. He proved the attested copy of the salary register for the month of August of year 2014 showing the salary of Avadh Kumar at Sr. no.156 (Ex.P10) and attested copy of salary register for the month of September of year 2014 (Ex.P11). 15.I have perused the oral as well as documentary evidence available on record and it transpires that there is sufficient evidence on record to show that the deceased was drawing salary of ₹7,238/- per month from the above said company. There is nothing on record from which it could be inferred that the above said documents proved by PW-3 Yogesh pertaining to the said company and regarding salary are forged and fabricated documents. 16.Keeping in view the above said oral as well as documentary evidence it has been proved that the deceased was working as helper in the above said company and at the time of accident the deceased was having monthly income of ₹7,238/- per month. Claimants have alleged that deceased was 30 years of age at the time of accident and there is no denial about the age of the deceased, being 30 years, from the respondents either. 17. In case titled Rajesh & Ors v Rajbir Singh & Ors., 2013 (3) Civil Court Cases 015 (S.C.), has been held that in case of self employed or a person of fixed wages, an addition of 50% to the actual income of the deceased if deceased was below 40 years of age. The above said income of the deceased is the actual income, as such, 50% of the income is to be added on account of future prospects i.e. 3,619₹ + 7,238₹ = 10,857/-. A₹s the number of the dependent family members are 4 therefore, after deducting 1/4th towards personal expenses of deceased i.e. 2,714/- per month the actual income of deceased comes to 8,143 and₹ ₹ keeping in view the age of the deceased of 30 years m ultiplier of 17 is to be applied in this case. Thus, total annual dependency of the claimants comes to 8,143₹ x 12 x 17 = 16,61,172₹. In addition to this, the claimants are further awarded a sum of 1,00₹,000 of care and guidance for minor children and 30,000 for f₹uneral expenses and ₹50,000 on account of loss of love and affection. Thus, in all, the claimants are held entitled to the total compensation of 18,41,172₹. The driver respondent no.1 and owner respondent no.2 are primarily responsible to pay this compensation, but since respondent no.3 being insurance company has agreed to indemnify respondent no.1 and 2, it is the respondent no.3 Insurance Company, which shall meet the liability by payment of the above stated amount. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of claimant and against the respondents. Issue no.3 and 4 18.Onus to prove these issues was upon the respondent insurance company. However no such evidence has been produced on file in the shape of document from which it could be inferred that at the time of alleged accident respondent no.1 was not holding valid and effective permit or that the offending vehicle was also not holding valid and effective permit at the time of alleged accident. Therefore in the absence of same, these issues are decided against the respondent no.3. Issue no.5 (Relief) 19.In view of the findings returned on the aforesaid issues, the claim petition is accepted with costs and an award of 18,41,172/-₹ is passed in favour of the claimants and against the respondent no.3. On the ground of interest reliance has been placed upon the judgment Partap Narain Singh Deo v. Srinivas Sabata, (1976) 1 SCC 289 , it is directed that interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the expiry of 30 days from the date of accident shall be paid by the Insurance company. Respondent no.3 is directed to pay the said amount within 2 months from today, failing which interest at the rate of 12% per annum shall be liable to be paid by the Insurance Company on the award amount from the date of filing of the present petition till the realization of award amount. All the claimants shall share the amount of compensation in equal shares. 20.Claimants also are directed to file account numbers in the court and to supply copy of the same to the learned counsel for insurance company within 15 days so that the compensation amount, as per share, is deposited in their account as ordered above. In case they fail to file the account numbers in the court, the insurance company shall file a Bank Draft of the compensation amount in the court within one and a half months of the expiry of 15 days period granted to the claimants for filing the account number, failing which they will be entitled to interest at the rate of 9% per annum. Share of the minor claimant no.2 to 4 be deposited in the shape of FDR in some Nationalized Bank. 21.Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.5,000/-. Memo of costs be prepared and file be consigned to record room. Announced: 19.10.2016 Kawaljit Singh, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ludhiana."

Respondents. CLAIM PETITION UNDER SECTION 163-A OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACT. Pr: Sh.Damandeep Singh advocate learned counsel for the claimants. Sh.Gurmeet Singh advocate learned counsel for respondent No.1. Sh.Vinod Kumar advocate learned counsel for respondent No.2. A W A R D 1.Present claim petition has been filed by the minor claimants namely Manpreet Kaur and Lovepreet Singh under section 163-A of the Motor Vehicle Act for grant of compensation on account of death of their 2 deceased father Sikander Singh. 2.In brief the facts of the present claim petition are that on 14.5.2015 Shri Sikander Singh since deceased was on the wheel of Truck bearing registration No. PB-10-BZ-1097 inside the truck. He started his journey from Sangrur to Hyderabad on truck bearing registration No. PB- 10-BZ-1097. The said truck was being driven by Shri Sikander Singh since deceased. On the way, when he reached at the out skirts of Bavupet Village of Karimnagar District he parked his Lorry Truck in front of Sri Rama High Way Bridge and was sleeping in his truck and died due to heart attack in his truck. The police was informed regarding this accident and the police conducted proceedings under section 174 Cr.P.C and FIR No. 243 dated 14.5.2015 was registered in this regard at P.S.Karimnagar rural. Deceased was working as driver and was earning Rs.40,000/- per annum. A sum of Rs. 50,000/- were spent on the transportation of dead body and last rites of the deceased. The truck bearing registration No. PB- 10-BZ-1097 was insured with respondent No.2. In last, prayer has been made for awarding compensation to the tune of Rs.5,00,000/- alongwith interest at the rate of 12% per annum. 2.Notice of the petition was served upon the respondents who appeared and filed their respective written statements. 3.Respondent No.1filed his written statement submitting therein that petition is not maintainable against him and liable to be dismissed. Respondent employed Sikander Singh since deceased as driver on the truck after taking test of driving of deceased who every time drove the vehicle as a perfect driver and possessed driving license which was seen 3 by him. He is not liable to pay the compensation since the truck in question was insured with respondent No.2. Denying remaining averments submissions made for dismissal of the petition qua him. 4.Respondent No.2 filed its written statement alleging that petition is not maintainable and respondent No.2 is not liable to pay the compensation as the offending vehicle did not have any valid registration certificate, proper driving license, permit and fitness certificate and thus has breached the conditions of the insurance policy. Driver of the offending vehicle has not complied with the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. There is no third party liability of the answering respondent, so no cause of action has accrued against the answering respondents. Denying remaining averments submissions made for dismissal of the claim petition. 5.From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed:- 1. Whether death of Sikander Singh was caused on 14.5.2015 due to heart attack while driving the truck bearing registration No. PB-10-BZ-1097 during the course of employment with respondent No.1 ?OPP. 2.Whether claimants are entitled to compensation of Rs.5,00,00,000/ alongwith interest @ 12%, if so from whom?OPP. 3.Whether present claim petition is not maintainable?OPR. 4.Relief.. 6.In order to prove their case, claimants examined two 4 witnesses whereas on the other hand in order to rebut the evidence led by the claimants, respondents did not examine any witness. However, respondent No.2 only tendered report Ex.R1 and close evidence 7.I have heard learned counsels for the parties and have gone through the entire evidence on the file carefully with their able assistance perused the file. Following are my findings on the various issues:- ISSUE NO.1. 8.Onus to prove this issue was placed upon the claimants. 9.The claimants in order to discharge their onus, examined Balwinder Singh as PW1. This witness while stepping into witness box stated categorically that claimant No.1 Smt. Mohinder Kaur expired on 7.9.2015 and certified copy of her death certificate is Ex.P1 on the file. He further stated that he is guardian of minor claimants No. 1 and 2 being their uncle. He further stated that on 14.5.2015 Sikander Singh since deceased was on wheel of truck bearing registration No. PB-10-BZ-1097 in side the truck. He started his journey from Sangrur to Hyderabad on above mentioned truck. The said truck was being driven by Sikander Singh since deceased. On the way, when he reached near the outskirts of Bavupet village of Karimnagar District he parked his lorry / truck in front of Sri Rama Highway Bridge and was sleeping in his truck and died due to heart attack in his truck. The Police was informed regarding the accident and police conducted proceedings under section 174 Cr.P.C and registered FIR No. 243 dated 14.5.2015. Copy of which is Ex.P3 on the file. He further stated that Sikander Singh since deceased was 40 years of age and he was 5 having good health at the time of his death and he was very hard worker. The deceased was earning Rs. 40,000/-per annum and all the claimants were dependent upon him in all respects. The father and wife of Sikander Singh deceased had already expired and mother of Sikander Singh died during the pendency of this petition. Sikander Singh died during the course of employment with respondent No.1. He further added a sum of Rs. 50,000/- has been spent on the transportation of dead body and last rites of the deceased and further he proved the postmortem report of deceased as Ex.P2 on the file. 10. It is worthwhile to mention over here that this witness faced the acid test of cross examination at the hands of learned counsel for respondents but nothing came on the file from which it could be presumed that version set forth by respondents in their reply is true. Rather, claimants further examined Gurpartap Singh son of Nachattar Singh as PW2 and this witness while stepping into witness box further supported the version of claimants apart from corroborating the deposition of PW1. This witness proved certified copy of FIR Ex.P3 on the file. So, from the evidence led by claimants it is very well proved on the file that death of Sikander Singh was caused on 14.5.2015 due to heart attack while driving the truck bearing registration No. PB-10-BZ-1097 during the course of employment with respondent No.1. It is also well established on the file from the written reply of respondent No.1 that deceased Sikander Singh was an employee of respondent No.1 being their driver on truck bearing registration No. PB-10-BZ-1097 insured with respondent No.2. I would also like to discuss here the case law titled Parampal Singh vs. National 6 Insurance Company Limited and another cited as 2013ACJ page 526, in which Hon'ble Apex court laid down that driver while driving truck felt giddy, parked the vehicle on road side and fainted in the vehicle, taken to Hospital and was declared brought dead. Claimant claimed that death of work man was due to stress and strain of continuous driving of truck in the course of his employment. Owner of vehicle denied that deceased was in his employment and stated that driver B.S. was driving the truck and he might have given lift to the deceased. FIR disclosed that second driver B.S. admitted that deceased was the senior driver who was driving the vehicle at the time of his death. Driver met with unexpected death with heart failure after he has driven the vehicle for about 1150 k.m. Commissioner found that death of work man was an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment. High Court reversed the order of commissioner and held that death was due to natural causes and he had no connection with the employment. Whether the workman suffered heart attack due to grave stress and strain and there is casual connection between the death of driver and his employment-- held—Yes-- Commissioner's order restored. 11Accordingly, in the light of above detailed discussion of mine and case law referred to above, issue No.1 is decided in favour of the claimants. ISSUE NO.3. 12.The onus to prove this was upon the respondent No.2 but from the perusal of file it reveals that no oral evidence has been led by respondent 7 No.2 in order to prove its version as set forth in written reply to the main petition. In the reply submitted by respondent No.2, a plea has been taken that respondent No.2 is not liable to pay any compensation as offending vehicle did not have any valid registration certificate and driver was not possessing proper driving license. Further, it has been pleaded that there was no proper permit or fitness certificate in respect of vehicle truck bearing registration No. PB-10-BZ-1097, due to that reason claimants are not entitled for any compensation and present petition is not maintainable at all. 13.Though, it has been so pleaded, but as discussed above no evidence has been led by the respondent No.2 in order to prove above mentioned contentions / pleadings qua registration certificate regarding legality and validity of driving license permit as well as fitness certificate in respect of above mentioned vehicle. Accordingly, this issue is decided against respondents. ISSUE NO.2. 14.The onus to prove this issue was upon the claimants. 15.It is very well proved on the file that claimants No. 1 and 2 are the minor children of deceased Sikander Singh and are class one heirs. It is also proved on the file that wife, mother as well as father of deceased Sikander Singh had already been expired. The claimants have alleged that deceased Sikander Singh was earning Rs. 40,000/-per annum being employee of respondent No.1 as a driver on vehicle truck bearing registration No. PB-10-BZ-1097. Respondent No.1 come present in the court and filed written reply and in its para No. 22 they admitted 8 categorically that deceased was the employee of answering respondent and was earning Rs. 40,000/-per annum. It is well settled law that facts which are admitted need not to be proved by way of evidence. It is well established on the file that deceased Sikander Singh was employee of respondent No.1 and earning Rs. 40,000/-per annum and income of deceased Sikander Singh is hereby assessed as Rs. 40,000/-per annum and out of the aforesaid amount 1/3rd is to be deducted towards expenses incurred by him towards maintaining himself as he being married person and as such for the purpose of computing compensation payable after deduction total contribution payable to the claimants would be Rs. 26,667/- per annum. 16.Now as the age of deceased Sikander Singh was 40 years at the time of his death, as such, multiplier of 14 will apply as per law laid down in Smt.

Respondents. CLAIM PETITION UNDER SECTION 163-A OF THE MOTOR VEHICLE ACT. Pr: Sh.Damandeep Singh advocate learned counsel for the claimants. Sh.Gurmeet Singh advocate learned counsel for respondent No.1. Sh.Vinod Kumar advocate learned counsel for respondent No.2. A W A R D 1.Present claim petition has been filed by the minor claimants namely Manpreet Kaur and Lovepreet Singh under section 163-A of the Motor Vehicle Act for grant of compensation on account of death of their 2 deceased father Sikander Singh. 2.In brief the facts of the present claim petition are that on 14.5.2015 Shri Sikander Singh since deceased was on the wheel of Truck bearing registration No. PB-10-BZ-1097 inside the truck. He started his journey from Sangrur to Hyderabad on truck bearing registration No. PB- 10-BZ-1097. The said truck was being driven by Shri Sikander Singh since deceased. On the way, when he reached at the out skirts of Bavupet Village of Karimnagar District he parked his Lorry Truck in front of Sri Rama High Way Bridge and was sleeping in his truck and died due to heart attack in his truck. The police was informed regarding this accident and the police conducted proceedings under section 174 Cr.P.C and FIR No. 243 dated 14.5.2015 was registered in this regard at P.S.Karimnagar rural. Deceased was working as driver and was earning Rs.40,000/- per annum. A sum of Rs. 50,000/- were spent on the transportation of dead body and last rites of the deceased. The truck bearing registration No. PB- 10-BZ-1097 was insured with respondent No.2. In last, prayer has been made for awarding compensation to the tune of Rs.5,00,000/- alongwith interest at the rate of 12% per annum. 2.Notice of the petition was served upon the respondents who appeared and filed their respective written statements. 3.Respondent No.1filed his written statement submitting therein that petition is not maintainable against him and liable to be dismissed. Respondent employed Sikander Singh since deceased as driver on the truck after taking test of driving of deceased who every time drove the vehicle as a perfect driver and possessed driving license which was seen 3 by him. He is not liable to pay the compensation since the truck in question was insured with respondent No.2. Denying remaining averments submissions made for dismissal of the petition qua him. 4.Respondent No.2 filed its written statement alleging that petition is not maintainable and respondent No.2 is not liable to pay the compensation as the offending vehicle did not have any valid registration certificate, proper driving license, permit and fitness certificate and thus has breached the conditions of the insurance policy. Driver of the offending vehicle has not complied with the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. There is no third party liability of the answering respondent, so no cause of action has accrued against the answering respondents. Denying remaining averments submissions made for dismissal of the claim petition. 5.From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed:- 1. Whether death of Sikander Singh was caused on 14.5.2015 due to heart attack while driving the truck bearing registration No. PB-10-BZ-1097 during the course of employment with respondent No.1 ?OPP. 2.Whether claimants are entitled to compensation of Rs.5,00,00,000/ alongwith interest @ 12%, if so from whom?OPP. 3.Whether present claim petition is not maintainable?OPR. 4.Relief.. 6.In order to prove their case, claimants examined two 4 witnesses whereas on the other hand in order to rebut the evidence led by the claimants, respondents did not examine any witness. However, respondent No.2 only tendered report Ex.R1 and close evidence 7.I have heard learned counsels for the parties and have gone through the entire evidence on the file carefully with their able assistance perused the file. Following are my findings on the various issues:- ISSUE NO.1. 8.Onus to prove this issue was placed upon the claimants. 9.The claimants in order to discharge their onus, examined Balwinder Singh as PW1. This witness while stepping into witness box stated categorically that claimant No.1 Smt. Mohinder Kaur expired on 7.9.2015 and certified copy of her death certificate is Ex.P1 on the file. He further stated that he is guardian of minor claimants No. 1 and 2 being their uncle. He further stated that on 14.5.2015 Sikander Singh since deceased was on wheel of truck bearing registration No. PB-10-BZ-1097 in side the truck. He started his journey from Sangrur to Hyderabad on above mentioned truck. The said truck was being driven by Sikander Singh since deceased. On the way, when he reached near the outskirts of Bavupet village of Karimnagar District he parked his lorry / truck in front of Sri Rama Highway Bridge and was sleeping in his truck and died due to heart attack in his truck. The Police was informed regarding the accident and police conducted proceedings under section 174 Cr.P.C and registered FIR No. 243 dated 14.5.2015. Copy of which is Ex.P3 on the file. He further stated that Sikander Singh since deceased was 40 years of age and he was 5 having good health at the time of his death and he was very hard worker. The deceased was earning Rs. 40,000/-per annum and all the claimants were dependent upon him in all respects. The father and wife of Sikander Singh deceased had already expired and mother of Sikander Singh died during the pendency of this petition. Sikander Singh died during the course of employment with respondent No.1. He further added a sum of Rs. 50,000/- has been spent on the transportation of dead body and last rites of the deceased and further he proved the postmortem report of deceased as Ex.P2 on the file. 10. It is worthwhile to mention over here that this witness faced the acid test of cross examination at the hands of learned counsel for respondents but nothing came on the file from which it could be presumed that version set forth by respondents in their reply is true. Rather, claimants further examined Gurpartap Singh son of Nachattar Singh as PW2 and this witness while stepping into witness box further supported the version of claimants apart from corroborating the deposition of PW1. This witness proved certified copy of FIR Ex.P3 on the file. So, from the evidence led by claimants it is very well proved on the file that death of Sikander Singh was caused on 14.5.2015 due to heart attack while driving the truck bearing registration No. PB-10-BZ-1097 during the course of employment with respondent No.1. It is also well established on the file from the written reply of respondent No.1 that deceased Sikander Singh was an employee of respondent No.1 being their driver on truck bearing registration No. PB-10-BZ-1097 insured with respondent No.2. I would also like to discuss here the case law titled Parampal Singh vs. National 6 Insurance Company Limited and another cited as 2013ACJ page 526, in which Hon'ble Apex court laid down that driver while driving truck felt giddy, parked the vehicle on road side and fainted in the vehicle, taken to Hospital and was declared brought dead. Claimant claimed that death of work man was due to stress and strain of continuous driving of truck in the course of his employment. Owner of vehicle denied that deceased was in his employment and stated that driver B.S. was driving the truck and he might have given lift to the deceased. FIR disclosed that second driver B.S. admitted that deceased was the senior driver who was driving the vehicle at the time of his death. Driver met with unexpected death with heart failure after he has driven the vehicle for about 1150 k.m. Commissioner found that death of work man was an accident arising out of and in the course of his employment. High Court reversed the order of commissioner and held that death was due to natural causes and he had no connection with the employment. Whether the workman suffered heart attack due to grave stress and strain and there is casual connection between the death of driver and his employment-- held—Yes-- Commissioner's order restored. 11Accordingly, in the light of above detailed discussion of mine and case law referred to above, issue No.1 is decided in favour of the claimants. ISSUE NO.3. 12.The onus to prove this was upon the respondent No.2 but from the perusal of file it reveals that no oral evidence has been led by respondent 7 No.2 in order to prove its version as set forth in written reply to the main petition. In the reply submitted by respondent No.2, a plea has been taken that respondent No.2 is not liable to pay any compensation as offending vehicle did not have any valid registration certificate and driver was not possessing proper driving license. Further, it has been pleaded that there was no proper permit or fitness certificate in respect of vehicle truck bearing registration No. PB-10-BZ-1097, due to that reason claimants are not entitled for any compensation and present petition is not maintainable at all. 13.Though, it has been so pleaded, but as discussed above no evidence has been led by the respondent No.2 in order to prove above mentioned contentions / pleadings qua registration certificate regarding legality and validity of driving license permit as well as fitness certificate in respect of above mentioned vehicle. Accordingly, this issue is decided against respondents. ISSUE NO.2. 14.The onus to prove this issue was upon the claimants. 15.It is very well proved on the file that claimants No. 1 and 2 are the minor children of deceased Sikander Singh and are class one heirs. It is also proved on the file that wife, mother as well as father of deceased Sikander Singh had already been expired. The claimants have alleged that deceased Sikander Singh was earning Rs. 40,000/-per annum being employee of respondent No.1 as a driver on vehicle truck bearing registration No. PB-10-BZ-1097. Respondent No.1 come present in the court and filed written reply and in its para No. 22 they admitted 8 categorically that deceased was the employee of answering respondent and was earning Rs. 40,000/-per annum. It is well settled law that facts which are admitted need not to be proved by way of evidence. It is well established on the file that deceased Sikander Singh was employee of respondent No.1 and earning Rs. 40,000/-per annum and income of deceased Sikander Singh is hereby assessed as Rs. 40,000/-per annum and out of the aforesaid amount 1/3rd is to be deducted towards expenses incurred by him towards maintaining himself as he being married person and as such for the purpose of computing compensation payable after deduction total contribution payable to the claimants would be Rs. 26,667/- per annum. 16.Now as the age of deceased Sikander Singh was 40 years at the time of his death, as such, multiplier of 14 will apply as per law laid down in Smt. Sarla Verma and others vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Anr reported in 2009(4) ALL MR 429 and and total compensation would be Rs.3,73,338/-. Apart from above mentioned amount, the claimants are also entitled for Rs. 25,000/- being funeral expenses as per law laid down in Rajesh Singh and others vs. Rajbir Singh and others reported in 2013(9) SCC page 54 . It is worthwhile to mention over here that claimants being minor children of deceased Sikander Singh who have lost both their parents,i.e mother as well as their father are also entitled for loss of love and affection as well as care and guidance to the tune of Rs. 1,00,000/- as laid down in Rajesh Singh and others vs. Rajbir Singh and others reported in 2013(9) SCC page 54. So, in total the claimants No. 1 and 2 are entitled for an amount of Rs.4,98,338/- 9 both in equal shares alongwith interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till its realisation. Accordingly, issue No.2 is decided in favour of claimants. RELIEF. 17.Keeping in view my above detailed discussion, findings on issues No. 1 to 3, present petition is hereby accepted and award is hereby passed in favour of the claimants and against the respondents for an amount of Rs. 4,98,338/- both in equal shares alongwith interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till its realisation from the respondents jointly and severally. The amount of award of minors shall be converted into F.D.Rs in some Natinoalised Bank and shall be released on attaining their age of majority.

Sh.D.R.Rampal Adv.,Counsel for the respondent No.5. A W A R D : The present is a claim petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act for grant of compensation on account of injuries suffered by the claimant Navneet Kaur in a motor vehicle accident which took place on 8.5.2014 at about 4 P.M.within the area of P.S. Sadar, Dhuri. 2.Briefly, the case of the claimant is that on 8.5.2014, the injured claimant was going to village Bhundh, Tehsil and District Patiala in Alto car bearing No.PB-10-CR-0678 to meet maternal grandmother and other relatives of her husband, namely Dr.Jagdeep Singh. She was accompanied by her husband late Dr.Jagdeep Singh, her father in law late S.Bhagwan Singh; her minor son Milaap Singh and maternal uncle of Dr.Jagdeep Singh, namely S. Bhupinder Singh. Bhupinder Singh had come to see his sister Amarjit Kaur and the other members of the family of his sister to Ludhiana from Village Bhundh, as such, he had also joined S.Bhagwan Singh and other members for going back to his village Bhundh. Dr.Jagdeep Singh was on the wheels of the car and S.Bhagwan Singh was sitting besides him and all other occupants including the claimant were sitting on the backside seat of the car. When at about 4 P.M. they had reached just ahead of Rattan Resorts, Dhuri, then one Tempo No.PB13-F-3428 which was being driven by the respondent No.1 rashly Page: 3 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.54 of 23.3.2015 and negligently and in a zigzag manner, came from the opposite direction and while coming on its wrong side of the road, struck against the car. As Dr.Jagdeep Singh was driving his car at a fast speed, he could not control his car and there was a head on collusion between the two vehicles. The respondent No.1 after striking the aforesaid tempo against the Alto car, had dragged the car for a distance on account of which the Alto car was badly damaged and all the occupants, including the claimant received multiple accidental injuries on their persons. Bhagwan Singh succumbed to the injuries on the way to the hospital while Dr.Jagdeep Singh succumbed to the injuries at the spot. The claimant received injuries on her person in a motor vehicle accident. As she was one of the occupants of the car, and she has not contributed in any manner in the causig of accident in question, as such, she is entitled to the claim compensation from the driver/insurer of both the vehicles i.e. either of tortfeasors and their insurer. 3.It is claimed that on account of said accident, the claimant has become permanently disabled person and is still sticken to bed. She has undergone two operations and is likely to undergo one more operation. The claimant will be unable to do any work as rods has been affixed in her left elbow and nails have been affixed. She is highly qualified and before the accident, she was serving with M/s Ganpati Impex and she was drawing a sum of Rs.16,000/- per month as salary. Apart from doing her duty with Ganpati Ipex, she used to earn a sum of Rs.10,000/- per month more by doing tution work, but now she is totally unemployed and is Page: 4 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.54 of 23.3.2015 unable to earn a single penny. She has been incapacitated for all times to come. Had she not suffered permanent disability, she would have had a very bright career and would have started earning Rs.1,00,000/- per month in the coming two years. She had great chances of her bright future. She has suffered a lot of pain and agony. She has lost charm of life and chances of better prospectus in her career ad her life has plunged into darkness. She has lost efficiency which will effect her future routine life adversely. She had gained lot of confidence with her employer but on account of receipt of injuries, she is unable to do her service which has hampered the better prospectus of the claimant. She is still under treatment and has not cured fully. She has been advised special diet and she has to engage a maid servant for her personal look after and is paying Rs.3000/- per month to the said maid. The compensation of Rs.30,00,000/- (thirty lacs) on account of injuries on the person of the claimant in the motor vehicle accident alongwith interest at the rate of 18% per annum from the date of accident till realisation has thus been sought. 4.The claim petition has been contested by the set of respondents by filing their separate written statements. In the written statement filed by the respondents no.1 and 2, they have taken the preliminary objections that the claim petition is not maintainable in the present form, no accident took place on 8.5.2014 at about 4 P.M.near Rattan Resorts, Dhuri of Tempo No.PB-13-F-3428 and Alto car No.PB-10-CR-0678 on account of the rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1. No injury has been Page: 5 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.54 of 23.3.2015 sustained by the claimant in the alleged accident. The respondent No.1 was driver by profession. He is holder of valid driving licence at the time of alleged accident. He is expert in his profession. The respondent No.2 is the owner of the said tempo. Before appointing the respondent No.1 as driver of tempo, his driving licence was duly verified by the respondent No.2 and it was in order. The respondent No.1 has been falsely implicated in case FIR No.90 of 8.5.2014 by the Police of P.S. Sadar, Dhuri at the instance of the complainant, who is a very influential person. Tempo No.PB-13-F-3428 was not insured with the Insurance Company at the time of alleged accident. The answering respondents are not liable to pay any compensation and interest to the claimant. On merits, the mode and manner of the accident has been denied. The registration of FIR against the respondent No.1 has been admitted, however, it has been stated to be based on false and concocted facts. It has been stated that no injury has been sustained by the claimant in the alleged accident. It has been denied that claimant spent a sum of Rs.5 lacs on her treatment and Rs.1,00,000/- more is to be spent on her treatment. The amount claimed in the claim petition is stated to be highly exaggerated and excessive. The answering respondents are not legally liable and bound to pay any compensation to the claimant as no accident took place with the vehicle of the answering respondents. It is denied that on account of said accident, the claimant has become permanently disabled person. It is denied that she has undergone two operations and is likely to undergo one more operation. It is denied that before the accident, the claimant was serving with M/s Page: 6 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.54 of 23.3.2015 Ganpati Impex or that she was drawing a sum of Rs.16,000/- per month as salary. It is further denied that apart from doing her duty with Ganpati Impex, she used to earn a sum of Rs.10,000/- per month more by doing tution work, but now she is totally unemployed and is unable to earn a single penny. It is also denied that she has been incapacitated for all times to come. It is denied that had she not suffered permanent disability, she would have had a very bright career and would have started earning Rs.1,00,000/- per month in the coming two years. It is denied that she has suffered a lot of pain and agony. It is denied that she has been advised special diet and she has to engage a maid servant for her personal look after and is paying Rs.3000/- per month to the said maid. The averments of the preliminary objections have been reiterated. While denying all other averments made in the petition, it has ultimately been prayed that the petition may be dismissed. 5.The respondent No.3 insurance company, without name and particulars, was impleaded. 6.The respondent No.4 has taken the preliminary objections that the petition is not maintainable since the accident has occurred due to rash and negligent driving of offending tempo No.PB-13-F-3482 and not on account of rash and negligent driving of Dr.Jagdeep Singh. Even FIR No.90 dated 8.4.2014 P.S. Sadar, Dhuri has been lodged against respondent No.1 i.e. driver of the tempo No.PB-13-F-3482. The claim petition is bad for misjoinder of parties since respondent No.4 is neither a necessary nor proper party to the claim petition. The claim petition is not Page: 7 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.54 of 23.3.2015 maintainable since car No.PB-10-CR-0678 is insured with the respondent No.5 for unlimited third party liability as per the provisions of Motor Vehicle Act as the car was comprehensively insured with the respondent No.5 and it is respondent No.5 who is to pay the compensation, if any, to the claimant. The claim petition is not maintainable since the respondent No.4 has not committed any breach of terms and conditions of the insurance policy. The car was comprehensively insured with the respondent No.5 and was badly damaged in the accident amounting to total loss. A claim was lodged for own damage of the car in question which was duly registered, processed and paid by the respondent No.5. Dr.Jagdeep Singh now deceased was holding a valid and effective driving licence on the date of alleged accident. On merits, it is denied that monthly income of the injured was Rs.16,000/-. It is denied that employer of injured was M/s Ganpati Impex, Giaspura Chowk, backside Shiv Shakti Hardware, Ludhiana. It is admitted that the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of offending tempo No.PB-13F-3482 and not on account of rash and negligent driving of deceased Dr.Jagdeep Singh. Even FIR No.90 dated 8.4.2014, P.S.Sadar, Dhuri, District Sangrur has been lodged against the respondent No.1 i.e. driver of tempo No.PB- 13-F-3482. It is denied that the injured received fracture on all bones of left elbow, grievous injuries on both pelvis bones, dislocation and severe accidental injuries on liver, right knee and other parts of the body. It is denied that the claimant has spent a sum of Rs.50,000/- on her treatment and Rs.1,00,000/- is more to be spent on her treatment. It is also admitted Page: 8 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.54 of 23.3.2015 that car No.PB-10-CR-0678 is insured with respondent No.5 under comprehensive insurance policy for unlimited third party liability. If any compensation is to be awarded, the same has to be paid by the respondent No.5. It has been further averred that deceased Dr.Jagdeep Singh was holding a valid and effective driving licence and respondent No.4 has not committed any breach of the terms and conditions of the policy. Own damage claim i.e. damage caused to the car No.PB-10-CR-0678 had already been paid by the respondent No.5. The respondent No.5 has been duly intimated about the death of Dr.Jagdeep Singh, S. Bhagwan Singh and injuries to the other occupants of the car, namely Navneet Kaur and Milap Singh at the time of lodging the claim in respect to the damage caused to the car No.PB-10-CR-0678. The amount claimed is stated to be grossly exaggerated and arbitrary. It is further submitted that car No.PB-10-CR-0678 is comprehensively insured with respondent No.5 for unlimited third party liability and it is the respondent No.5 who is liable to pay compensation if any to the claimant. It is denied that she has undergone two operations and is likely to undergo one more operation. It is denied that she is highly qualified and before the accident, she was serving with M/s Ganpati Impex on a salary of Rs.16,000/- per month or that apart from the same, she used to earn a sum of Rs.10,000/- P.M. more by doing tution work. It is further denied that had she not suffered permanent disability, she could have had a very bright career and would have started earning Rs.1,00,000/- per month in the coming two years. It is denied that she has to engage a maid servant for her personal look after Page: 9 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.54 of 23.3.2015 to whom she is paying Rs.3000/-P.M. It is submitted that the accident has occurred due to rash and negligent driving of offending tempo No.PB- 13F-3482 and not on account of rash and negligent driving of deceased Dr.Jagdeep Singh. It is denied that Dr.Jagdeep Singh was driving his car at a fast speed, he could not control his car. It is denied that there was a head on collusion between two vehicles. It is however submitted that Dr.Jagdeep Singh and Bhgwan Singh had succumbed to the injuries whereas Navneet Kaur and Milap Singh have received injuries. While denying all other averments, it has ultimately been prayed that the claim petition may be dismissed. 7.The respondent No.5 has averred in the written statement by taking preliminary objections that the claim petition is not drafted in accordance with rules of the Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court and Motor Vehicle Act and the same is not verified in accordance with the provisions of Order 6 Rule 15 of the CPC and the same is not maintainable in the present form. The claim petition is bad for non joinder and misjoinder of necessary parties. The claimants have not suffered the loss of any kind. Deceased Dr.Jagdeep Singh was not working anywhere. The claimants are not legal heirs of deceased and they were not dependent upon the deceased and were not entitled to any compensation and they are estopped by their act and conduct from filing this petition. Even as per the allegations mentioned in the claim petition, the alleged accident took place due to negligence of Dr.Jagdeep Singh deceased and claimants cannot take the advantage of own wrong of deceased Dr.Jagdeep Singh Page: 10 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.54 of 23.3.2015 and cannot demand any compensation. The respondent No.1 and deceased Dr.Jagdeep Singh were not possessing valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident and were also not driving Tempo No.PB- 13-F-3428 and Car No.PB-10-CR-0678 in the course of his employment with the owner and insured of above said vehicles and have violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and also breached the provisions of the M.V .Act. The insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation. The vehicle No.PB-10-CR-0678 was not having valid registration certificate and fitness certificate at the time of alleged accident and was being driven against the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and in violation of Motor Vehicle Act. The owner and insured of vehicles were fully aware that respondent No.1 and Dr.Jagdeep Singh did not possess valid and effective driving licencces and they did not take due precaution and reasonable care and as such the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. No liability can be fastened on the answering respondent. The answering respondent takes all defences under Section 147, 149, 157, 170 of the Motor Vehicle Act and reserves its right to file an amended written statement and additional written statement on disclosure of new facts. The vehicle is stated to be insured with the answering respondent, should comply with the provisions of Section 64 VB of the Insurance Act, 1938. The answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation as demanded in the petition. If it is held by this Tribunal that case of claimants is fully established and answering respondent is liable to pay compensation, then sufficient time Page: 11 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.54 of 23.3.2015 may kindly be granted to deposit the award amount without any interest. On merits, it is averred that no accident took place as alleged. The claimants be put to strict proof of the allegations made in the claim petition. The mode and manner of the accident has been denied. It has been averred that even as per the allegations mentioned in the claim petition, deceased Dr.Jagdeep Singh was negligent at the time of alleged accident and claimants cannot take the advantage of own wrong of deceased Dr.Jagdeep Singh. The claimants cannot demand the compensation on account of death of deceased Dr.Jagdeep Singh in this claim petition. While denying all other averments of the claim petition, it has been prayed that the same may be dismissed. 8.On the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed and recorded: “1.

OPR. 4.Whether the claim petition is bad for non joinder and misjoinder of necessary parties? OPR. 5. Relief.” 9.Later on,vide order dated 29.4.2016,the issue No.1 was amended as under: Page: 12 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.54 of 23.3.2015 Amended Issue No.1. 1. Whether claimant Navneet Kaur received injuries in motor vehicle accident caused on 8.5.2014 due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 while driving vehicle i.e. tempo No.PB-13F-3428 and of deceased Dr.Jagdeep Singh while driving Alto Car No.PB-10-CR-0678? OPP 10.The claimant Navneet Kaur herself in support of her case has appeared as PW1 and has deposed by way of her Affidavit Ex.PA. Dr.Gurpreet Singh was examined as PW2 and Ravi Sethi, Partner Ganpati Impex, Gill Chowk, Ludhiana was examined as PW3. Dr.Devinder Kumar from the Civil Hospital, Ludhiana was examined as PW4. Thereafter, the learned Counsel for the claimant tendered into evidence photocopy of diploma certificate Ex.PX and clsoed the evidence of the claimant. The learned Counsel for the respondents No.1 and 2 closed the evidence without leading any evidence. The learned Counsel for the respondents No.4 and 5 tendered into evidence the documents and closed their evidence. In rebuttal evidence, detail of bills has been tendered by the learned Counsel for the claimant as Ex.PX which is duly countersigned by the learned Counsel for the respondent. 11.I have heard the learned Counsel for the parties and have gone through the record with their able assistance. My issue-wise findings are as under: Page: 13 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.54 of 23.3.2015 Issues No.1 and 2: 12.Both these issues are interconnected and can be discussed and disposed of together conveniently. 13.The learned Counsel for the claimant has contended that it is a case of composite negligence and liability and by examining the witnesses and placing on record the documents regarding treatment, the claimant has proved her case and is entitled to the compensation sought for. 14.The Counsel for respondent No.4 and respondent No.5 have urged that the FIR was registered against Kewal Singh driver of the offending vehicle. Only Kewal Singh driver and Jang Singh owner are liable to compensate the claimant. It has appeared in the cross examination of the PW1 that her husband Jagdeep Singh was also negligent to some extent. Therefore, it is a case of contributory negligence and if the compensation is required to be paid by the respondents No.4 and 5, their liability is minimum and to the lowest extent. 15.The learned Counsel for the respondents No.1 and 2 has contended that vehicle of respondent No.4 was insured with the respondent No.5 which caused the accident and only respondents No.4 and 5 are liable to pay the compensation. 16.Navneet Kaur is the claimant. She is the widow of Dr.Jagdeep Singh and daughter in law of Bhagwan Singh deceased. She has narrated the version regarding happening of the accident as has been pleaded in the petition. In the Affidavit Ex.PA, she has reasserted and reiterated her entire pleaded case which depositions may be omitted to be mentioned Page: 14 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.54 of 23.3.2015 here again. It has appeared in her cross-examination as pointed out by the Counsel for the respondents that the center of front of both the vehicles had struck against each other. The husband of the deponent was driving the car at high speed. He was negligent to some extent. The FIR was registered against the respondent No.1 driver of tempo No.PB-13-F-3428 at the instance of Bhupinder Singh. There were five persons in the car. 17.Dr.Gurpreet Singh,M.S.Ortho, Department of Orthopedics, D.M.C.Hospital, Ludhiana was examined as PW2, who brought the summoned record pertaining to claimant Navneet Kaur who was admitted in the hospital on 8.5.2014 and discharged on 20.5.2014. He broght the record of discharge summary and stated that the patient was having history of road side accident. He proved on record the Discharge Summary as Ex.P5. He deposed that the claimant was operated two times i.e. on 9.5.2014 and 14.5.2014 and stated that the patient will have adverse effect on his person and normal life. He then deposed that the patient has suffered permanent disability and the patient is coming to their hospital for follow up treatment. 18.Ravi Sethi, Partner Ganpati Impex, Gill Chowk, Ludhiana was examined as PW3. He brought the record pertaining to employment of Navneet Kaur in their firm and deposed that as per record, she was drawing a salary of Rs.15,000/- per month. The original certificate Ex.PW3/A is issued by him and is correct as per record. He brought the original partnership deed and produced on record copy of partnership deed as Ex.PW3/B. He also produced on record copy of salary account of Page: 15 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.54 of 23.3.2015 Navneet Kaur as Ex.PW3/C alongwith copy of PAN Card as Ex.PW3/D. 19.Dr.Devinder Kumar, Medical Officer, (M.S. Ortho), Civil Hospital, Ludhiana was examined as PW4 who brought the summoned record pertaining to issuance of Disability Certificate of Navneet Kaur by deposing that she was found to be having 10% disability of permanent nature on her person which was so assessed by the Board of Doctors in which he was also one of the members. He proved on record the Disability Certificate as Ex.PW4/A and deposed that the patient will have adverse effects throughout her life as the disability is of permanent nature and there is least chance of diminition of disability. 20.FIR Ex.P:98 was recorded at the instance of Bhupinder Singh wherein it has been recorded that the accident took place because of rash and negligent driving of the tempo 407 bearing no,.PB-13-F-3428 by its driver, who directly hit the tempo in their car. 21.The car of Jagjit Singh is bearing No.PB-10-CR-0678 is insured with the respondent No.5. Ex.R1 is the insurance policy of the said car, copy of certificate of insurance Ex.R2. The accident took place on 8.5.2014. The offending vehicle was insured with the respondent No.5, copy of insurance cover is Ex.R2. The insurance was valid from 24.2.2014 till midnight of 23.2.2015. The accident took place within the validity period of the insurance policy. No fault in the insurance, certificate of registration and driving licence has been pointed out and proved by the respondent No.5. 22.The FIR Ex.P:98 was recorded in this case against the driver of Page: 16 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.54 of 23.3.2015 tempo No.PB-13-F-3482 respondent No.1. It is on the basis of it that the learned Counsel for the respondent No.5 has contended that driver of the offending tempo No.PB-13-F-3482 and owner are liable to pay compensation. The contributory negligence, if any, of the deceased driver of the car owned by the respondent No.4, is very limited. 23.After considering the rival contentions of both the sides and going through the record, the Court is of the opinion that it is a case of composite negligence. In the pronouncement reported as “National Insurance Co.Ltd. Vs. P.A.Vergis, I(1991) ACC 226”, it has been observed that the case of composite negligence is one when the accident occurs and resulting injuries and damages flow without any negligence on the part of the claimant but as a result of the negligence on the part of two or more persons. In such a case, the Tribunal should pass a composite decree against owners of both vehicles. In “United India Fire & Genl.Ins.Co. Ltd. V . Varghese, 1989 ACJ 472 (Kerala)” , it has been observed that in a case of composite negligence, the injured has option to proceed against all or any of the joint tort-feasors. Therefore, the insurer cannot take a defence that action is not sustainable as the other joint tort feasors have not been made parties. Similar is the view taken in United India Fire & Genl.Ins.Co.Ltd.V . U.E. Prasad, 1985 ACJ 280 (Karnataka). In Andhra Marine Exports (P) Ltd. V . P.Radhakrishnan, 1984 ACJ 355 (Madras), it has been held that every wrongdoer is liable for whole damages in the case of composite negligence if it is otherwise made out. Page: 17 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.54 of 23.3.2015 24.Similar is the view taken in Kundan Bala Vora V . State of Uttar Pradesh, 1984 ACJ 99 (Allahabad), where a collision between a bus and car took place. Negligence of both the drivers was found. It was held that they would be jointly and severally liable to pay the whole damages. In Narain Devi V . Swaran Singh, 1989 ACJ 1118 (Delhi), there was a case of composite negligence by drivers of two trucks involved in an accident which hit the Tempo from two sides. The proportion in which the two vehicles misconducted or offended was not decided. It was held by the High Court that the Tribunal was right in holding the liability of tort- feasors as joint and several. 25.In the pronouncement reported as “Kamlesh & Ors. Versus Attar Singh & Ors., 2016(1) R.C.R.(Civil) 24” of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, it has been held as under: “8. We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused, inter alia, the evidence on record of Ram Parshad PW2 and Devender PW.3. The method and manner in which the accident has taken place leaves no room for doubt that it was a case of composite negligence of drivers of both the vehicles, that is the driver of Maruti car and driver of tempo. Though Police has registered a case against driver of the tempo Attar Singh and has filed a charge sheet but the same cannot be said to be conclusive. Though, Attar Singh has Page: 18 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.54 of 23.3.2015 stated that it was in order to oblige the driver of the Maruti car, a case was registered against him. Be that as it may. It appears both the drivers have tried to save their liability. In such circumstances, the version of eye-witnesses, PW.2 and PW.3 assumes significance. The fact remains that car had dashed the tempo on the middle portion near footstep. Thus the method and manner in which the accident has taken place leaves no room for doubt that both the drivers were negligent. Man may lie but the circumstances do not is the cardinal principle of evaluation of evidence. No effort has been made by the High Court to appreciate the evidence and method and manner in which the accident has taken place. Both the aforesaid witnesses have stated Maruti Car was in excessive speed. However, it appears driver of tempo also could not remove his vehicle from the way of Maruti Car. Thus, both the drivers were clearly negligent. It appears from the facts and circumstances that both the drivers were equally responsible for the accident. Thus, it was a case of composite negligence. Both the drivers were joint 'tort-feasors', thus, liable to make payment of Page: 19 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.54 of 23.3.2015 compensation.” 26.It is a settled principle of law that where the case is of composite negligence and the owner and insurance company of the other vehicle have been impleaded, the apportionment of compensation between two tort feasors is not permissible. The claimant can recover at his option whole damages from any of them but the Tribunal can determine interse extent of composite negligence of the drivers, for the purpose of their interse liability so that one may recover the same from the other after making the payment to the claimant to the extent it has satisfied the liability of the other. The one tort feasors can recover the amount from the other in the execution proceedings. 27. The perusal of evidence of the claimant would reveal that she was treated for the injuries and remained in the DMC Hospital, Ludhiana for injuries w.e.f. 8.5.2014 to 20.5.2014. The Discharge Summary has been proved on record as Ex.P5 by examining Dr.Gurpreet Singh from the DMC Hospital, Ludhiana. She has suffered 10% disability of permanent nature on accoun to the accident as per the evidence of Dr.Devinder Kumar, PW4, who has also proved the Disability Certificate. He has proved the Disability Certificate being member of the Board as Ex.PW4/A. Ravi Sethi PW3 being parntner of M/s Ganpati Impex, Gill Chowk, Ludhiana has proved on record salary certificate pertaining to claimant Navneet Kaur as Ex.PW3/A showing her salary to be of Rs.15000/- per month. He also proved on record copy of partnership deed as Ex.PW3/B along with copy of Salary Account of the claimant as Page: 20 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.54 of 23.3.2015 Ex.PW3/C and copy of her PAN Card as Ex.PW3/D. The detail of bills in the shape of calculation sheet Ex.PX has been produced on record in rebuttal evidence by the learned Counsel for the claimant which is duly countersigned by the learned Counsel for the respondent in token of its correctness, the total of the bills as per which is Rs. 2,42,962/-. The disability of 10% has been proved by the PW2 and the salary certificate of Rs.15,000/- per month has been proved by the PW3. The claimant has alleged that she was giving tution to students but no proof of such tution has been placed on record. In order to get benefit on the monetary side regarding 10% disability, the claimant intended to include the expenses of maid servant employed by her but she admitted that no appointment letter was issued for appointing the maid servant and she has not received any receipt from the maid servant. There is also no other record to prove that the maid servant was employed by her. Therefore, the amount of Rs.15,000/- received by her towards her pay is to be taken as the amount for assessing the compensation for 10% permanent disability. Thus the disability amount comes to Rs.1500/- per month i.e. Rs.18,000/- per annum. The multiplier of 16 is applicable in this case. Thus by applying the multiplier of 16, the amount of compensation comes to Rs.2,88,000/-. The claimant remained hospitalised for 13 days. Obviously, he suffered pain and agony, availed services of the attendant and had to take special diet and for all these heads and non pecuniary damages, she is entitled to the compensation of the amount of Rs.30,000/-. As per Ex.PW3/C, she received Rs.3500/- in the month of 16.5.2014, there is loss of income to Page: 21 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.54 of 23.3.2015 the extent of Rs.11,500/-. The claimant is thus found entitled to a total compensation of Rs. 2,42,962/-+ Rs.2,88,000/- + Rs.30,000 + Rs.11,500/- = Rs.5,72,462/- (Five lacs seventy two thousand, four hundred and sixty two rupees only). 28.If the amount is recovered/paid by the respondent No.4, his vehicle being insured with the respondent No.5 and the accident having taken place within the validity period of insurance, the respondent No.5 is liable to reimburse the respondent No.4. These respondents No.1,2, 4 and 5 being joint tort feasors, the apportionment of compensation between them is not permissible. The claimant can recover at her option whole damages from any of them. However, the interse liability so that one set may recover the sum from the other after making whole of the payment to the claimant to the extent it has satisfied the liability of the other by way of execution without filing a separate suit, is assessed to be 50% of the respondents No.1 and 2 and 50% of the respondents No.4 and 5. Both these issues are thus decided against the respondents and in favour of the claimant. Issue No.3: 29.In view of the findings returned on the issues No.1 and 2, the Court is of the opinion that the claim petition filed by the claimant seeking compensation on account of injuries suffered by her in a motor vehicle accident is duly maintainable in the present form but the respondents have failed to prove as to how the petition is not maintainable. Page: 22 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.54 of 23.3.2015 Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. Issue No.4: 30.This issue was not pressed upon during the course of arguments and the same has been abandoned with the same convenience with which is was taken. As such, the same is decided against the respondents and in favour of the claimants. Relief 31.As a result of the above findings on the above issues, the claim petition is allowed. the total amount of the compensation thus comes out to be Rs.5,72,462/- (Five lacs seventy two thousand, four hundred and sixty two rupees only) from the respondents No.1,2,4 and 5 . These respondents No.1,2, 4 and 5 being joint tort feasors, the apportionment of compensation between them is not permissible. The claimant can recover at her option whole damages from any of them. However, the interse liability so that one set may recover the sum from the other after making whole of the payment to the claimant to the extent it has satisfied the liability of the other by way of execution without filing a separate suit, is assessed to be 50% of the respondents No.1 and 2 and 50% of the respondents No.4 and 5. If the payment of the compensation amount is not made by the respondents No.1,2, 4 and 5 to the claimant as ordered within two months from today, the claimant shall be entitled to interest @ 9% per annum on the total amount of compensation from the date of claim petition, till realisation.

The clam petition is bad for non-joinder and mis-joinder of necessary parties to the present claim petition. Alto Car No.HR-32-E-8760 did not have the valid registration certificate, route permit and fitness certificate at the time of alleged accident which amounts to breach of terms of policy, thus the respondent no.3 is not liable to pay any compensation. The Insurance of the subject vehicle should comply with section 64(V) (b) of the Insurance Act, 1938. The claimant have not furnished their residence proof, identity proof, legal heir certificate to show that the claimants are legally entitled to file the present claim petition at Ludhiana or at any other place. On merits, all the remaining averments of the claim petition has been denied and Lastly, a prayer for dismissal of the claim petition has been made. 5 6.From the pleadings of the parties the following issues were framed on 28.5.2015:- 1.Whether Guddu Hussain died on 10.12.2014 near Grain Market Machhhiwara on account of the motor vehicle accident caused by respondent no.1 while driving the offending vehicle Car Alto K-10 bearing NO.HR-32-E-8760 in a rash and negligent manner?OPP 2. Whether the claimant is legal representative of the deceased entitled for compensation, if so to what extent?OPP 2A.

Relief. 7.In order to prove her case, the claimant examined Babu Khan as PW1, who tendered into evidence his duly sworn affidavit Ex.PA, Balramji Dass as PW2, who tendered into evidence his duly sworn affidavit Ex.PB, claimant herself stepped into witness box as PW3 and tendered into evidence her duly sworn affidavit Ex.PC alongwith 6 documents Ex.PW3/1, Ex. PW3/2 and Mark-A. Thereafter, counsel for the claimant tendered into evidence documents certified copy of report u/s 173 Cr.P.C, charge sheet, RC of the car bearing no.HR-32E-8760, FIR and attested copy of Post mortem report as Ex.P1 to Ex.P5 and closed the evidence of claimant. 8. On the other hand, respondent no.1 Sukhbir tendered into evidence Notarized copy of driving licence Ex.R6, photo copy of DL which is Mark-B and closed his evidence. Respondent no.2 Manjit Singh has tendered into evidence certified copy of RC which is Ex.R5 and photo copy of Insurance cover note as Mark-A and closed his evidence. Sh. G.S.Kalyan Adv. Counsel for respondent no.3 has tendered into evidence policy, DL verification, DL and RC verification report as Ex.R1 to Ex.R4 and closed his evidence. 9.I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have also examined the record of the case. My issue-wise findings are as under:- 1.Whether Guddu Hussain died on 10.12.2014 near Grain Market Machhhiwara on account of the motor vehicle accident caused by respondent no.1 while driving the offending vehicle Car Alto K-10 bearing NO.HR-32-E-8760 in a rash and negligent manner?OPP 2. Whether the claimant is legal representative of the deceased entitled for compensation, if so to what extent?OPP 3.Whether no such accident has occurred with the vehicle of respondent No.1?OPR 10.All these issues have been taken up together being inter 7 connected. The onus to prove issues no.1 and 2 was on the claimant, whereas issue no.3 was on the respondent. Amina Khatoon claimant no.1 herself stepped into witness box as PW3 and tendered her affidavit Ex.PC and reiterating the facts mentioned in the petition. Babu Khan eye witness of the accident appeared as PW2 and he tendered his affidavit Ex.PA in his examination in chief. As per the deposition of PW1 Babu Khan, on 10.12.2014 the deceased was coming to his house situated at Chopra Colony, Machhiwara from Machhiwara Mandi, Samrala Road, Ludhiana alongwith his rehri. At that time, deponent Babu Khan was also coming with the deceased. The rehri was being pulled by the deceased and Babu Khan was coming behind him on foot and when they reached at some distance from Gate No.1 of Grain Market, Machhiwara, then at about 07.50PM, the offending vehicle i.e Alto K-10 car bearing registration No.HR-32-E-8760 being driven by the respondent no.1 in rash and negligent manner and at a very high speed came from Samrala side and struck the vehicle against the deceased, due to which he fell down and sustained multiple and grievous injuries on various parts of the body including injuries on the head and his rehri was also damaged. Due to impact of injuries, the deceased died at the spot. 11. In addition to the testimony of eye witness PW Babu Khan, claimant has tendered into evidence certified copy of report under section 173 Cr.P.C in FIR No.255 dated 11.12.2014 against the respondent no.1 Ex.P1, copy of charge sheet Ex.P2 vide which Ld. Judicial Magistrate Ist Class framed the charges under section 279/304A IPC in the criminal trial, copy of FIR Ex.P4 no.255 dated 11.12.2014 From the copy of post 8 mortem report Ex P5, it stands proved that deceased received multiple injuries in the accident and succumbed to the injuries. FIR (EX.P4) in the present case has been registered at the instance of Babu Khan against the driver of offending vehicle i.e. Car Alto K-10 bearing No.HR-32-E-8760 for driving the vehicle in rash and negligent manner. It is evident from the post mortem report, copy of FIR and copy of challan that deceased died due to the injuries sustained by him in the accident which is caused by rash and negligent driving by respondent no.1 12.Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in case titled as Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Shyam and others 1993(2) PLR 109 , wherein it was observed by the Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court that “ when the driver was facing criminal trial, it has to be prima facie concluded that the accident took place due to his rash and negligent driving.” 13. In National Insurance Co. Limited versus Pushpa Rana and other 2009 ACJ 287 Hon'ble Delhi High Court has held that certified copies of criminal Court record such as FIR, recovery memo and mechanical inspection report are sufficient proof to reach the conclusion that driver was driving the vehicle rashly. Proceedings under M. V Act are not akin to proceedings in a civil suit and hence strict rules of evidence are not required to be followed in this regard. 14.In view of the ratio laid down in aforementioned authorities, after considering the entire material on record, I am of the view that deceased Guddu Hussain suffered fatal injuries in an accident caused by respondent no.1 by driving the car in a rash and negligent manner. 9 Claimant Amina Khatoon has deposed in her evidence that she is the mother of deceased Guddu Hussain and aforesaid averment of the claimant goes un-rebutted as the respondents have nor produced any evidence which may suggest that Amina Khatoon is not the mother of deceased Guddu Hussain. Accordingly, issue No.1,2 and 3 are decided in favour of claimant and against the respondents.. Issue no.2AIf issue no.1 is proved in affirmative, whether the claimant is entitled to recover the compensation, if so, from which of the respondents and to what amount?OPP Issue no.5 Whether respondent no.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving license and permit at the time of alleged accident?OPR 15.Onus to issue no.2A was upon the claimant and issue no.5 was upon the respondents. CW3 Amina Khatoon stepped into witness box and she deposed that deceased was his son and she was dependent upon the earnings of deceased Guddu Hussain. She further deposed that deceased was doing the work of selling eggs, cold drinks, Mungfali, Gazak etc. on a Rehri. PW2 Balramji Dass stepped into the witness box and he tendered his affidavit Ex.PB in his examination in chief, in which he deposed that he is in the business of giving Rehri on rent to the intending persons. Deceased Guddu Hussain had also taken one rehri on rent and he used to run this rehri in favour of liquor vend, opposite Grain Market, Samrala Road, Machhiwara to sell Mungfali, Eggs,Namkeen and other eatables. He further deposed that Guddu Hussain deceased used to pay Rs.1800/- per month as rent for hiring a rehri. Claimant in her petition 10 has averred that deceased was earning about Rs.25,000/- per month. However, no documentary evidence has been produced on the case file which can suggest that deceased was earning Rs.25,000/- per month from his aforesaid business. In Syed Sadiq Etc. Vs. Divisional Manager, United India Insurance Co.,2014(1)RCR(Civil)765, Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that in the present state of economy and the rising prices in agricultural products, a vegetable vendor is reasonably capable of earning Rs.6500/- per month. In view of the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court and keeping in view the present economic scenario, this court has no hesitation in assessing the income of the deceased at Rs.6500/- per month. Keeping in view the dependency on the earning of the deceased, the 50% income of the deceased is deducted on account of personal expenses. As per the pleadings of the claimants, deceased was 22,1/2 years of age. In the post mortem report, the age of deceased Guddu Hussain is mentioned as 21 years. Therefore the age of the deceased is taken as 21 years on the date of accident. In view of the ration laid down in case titled Smt. Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation,2009(3)RCR(Civil),77, the relevant multiplier of 18 is applicable keeping in view the age of the deceased. Future prospects 16. Learned Counsel for the claimants have placed reliance upon the judgment of Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana high Court in case titled Smt Renu Devi and others versus Sh. Mohammad Yunis Volume CLXX-(2013-2) PLR 743 for future prospects for loss of dependency. Hon'ble High Court has laid down the criteria for addition of future 11 prospects in case of a labourer as under “24. A labourer who received a daily wage of Rs 50 about 7 years ago has started getting at least a sum of Rs 150-200 per day. Though, there is no fixed increment for him or his daily wage, the minimum wage is periodically is increased by the State Governments concerned taking into account the cost of living. In fact the cost of living affects one and all, irrespective of the class to which the victim belongs. A labourer who gets a sum of Rs. 3750/- per month would not be getting the same wage even after 17 long years. In view of the above, I find that applying the principle of 30% addition towards the future prospect of the deceased ho was a labourer without considering the slab contempalted in the case of Sarla Verma would be unfair, inappropriate and discriminatory. In view oif the above, I find that 50% of the income in case of a labourer or wage earner or a person with a fixed salary without increment in case he was below 40 years and 30% income in case he was between 40-50 years will have to be added towards their future prospects while calculating loss of dependency.” 17.In Munna Lal Jain and another Vs. Vipin Kumar Sharma and others,2015,RCR(Civil)447 , Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the deceased was employed. If the deceased victim is below 40 years, there must be addition of 50% to the actual income of the deceased while computing future prospects. Therefore, 50% of the amount of salary is liable to be added for future prospects. 18. No amount of money can compensate the loss of a human life. No amount of money can wipe the tears, the trauma of the claimants. The 12 trauma is for the lifetime. Therefore, the claimant is also entitled to get non-pecuniary compensation towards loss of love and affection, loss to estate and funeral expenses. Claimant is held entitled for compensation to the extent of 1,00,000/- . for loss of love and care from her son in her old age. Compensation for loss of estate is assessed at Rs.10,000/- and the compensation for funeral expenses are assessed at Rs.25,000/-. Therefore, the total compensation is assessed as under:- , sr.no. HEADS CALCULATION 1. Wages 6500/- 2. 50% to be added as future prospects in item no. 1 6500+3250= 9750 3. Deduction of I/2rd as personal expenses 9750-4850= 4850 4. Multiplier of 18 applied 4850x18x12= 10,47,600/- 5. Loss of love and affection for claimant 1,00,000(Rs.1 lac for claimant. 6. Funeral Expenses 25,000/- 7. Loss of estate 10,000/- Total Compensation 11,82,600/- 19. Now the question arises from whom claimant is entitled to receive the compensation. Admittedly the offending vehicle HR-32E-8760 is insured with Respondent No. 3 National Insurance Company Ltd. vide insurance policy Ex R1 which is valid on the date of accident. Certificate of registration Ex R5 has been placed on file. The driving license of respondent no.1 Sukhbir is Ex.R2. As per the report of Licensing authority Narwana appended on Ex.R2, the license of respondent no.1 Sukhbir is valid upto 18.1.2029. As such respondent no. 3 has failed to show any violation of the terms and condition of insurance policy. 13 Accordingly this Tribunal is of the considered view that there was no violation of the rules and terms of policy by the respondents no. 1 and 2. Hence, I am of the opinion that respondent no.3 National Insurance Company limited is liable to pay the compensation to claimant. Accordingly issues 2A and 3 are decided in favour of claimants and against the respondent. Issue no.4 Whether the claim petition is not maintainable?OPR Issue no.6 Whether petition is bad for non-joinder of the parties? OPR 20.Onus to prove these issues was upon the respondents. No arguments was advanced by Ld. Counsel for the respondents on these issues nor these issues was pressed, as such, both these issues are decided against the respondents. Relief 21.As a result of my discussion above, the present claim petition filed by the claimants is partly allowed with costs. The claimants are held entitled to the compensation to the tune of Rs. 11,82,600/- from the respondents jointly and severally. The respondent No.3 will pay the above said compensation amount to the claimant along with interest at the rate of 9 % per annum , from the date of the filing of present claim petition till the decision of the same. The claimant shall be entitled to future interest at the rate of 6% per annum, till the realization of total amount. However following directions are given for apportionment of compensation: (A) 40% of the total compensation shall be released in favour claimant 14 immediately. Balance compensation shall be deposited in 5 FDRs of equal amount for a period of 1 to 5 years in any nationalized bank of the choice of Claimant monthly interest will be credited in the Saving Bank Account of claimant regularly. (B) No loan or advance will be given against these deposits. (C) FDRs shall not be prematurely encashed without leave of this Tribunal. Memo of cost be prepared. Pleader fee is assessed at Rs. 1000/-. File be consigned to the Record Room. Pronounced in open Court DINESH KUMAR 16.7.2016 Motor Accident Claims Tribunal Ludhiana"

Atul Bansal & Others 5 examined Nitin Garg as CW-2 who deposed through his duly sworn affidavit Ex.CB and Rakesh Kumar as CW-3 who deposed through his duly sworn affidavit Ex.C-3 and tendered documents Ex.C-6 to Ex.C-9. Thereafter, learned counsel for claimant closed the claimant evidence. 8.In order to rebut the evidence of claimants, respondents did not adduce any oral evidence. However, Ld counsel for respondents no.1 & 2 tendered into evidence certified copy of DDR no.37 dated 26.10.2014 as Ex.R-1 and closed the evidence on behalf of respondents no.1 & 2. On the other hand, Ld counsel for respondents no.3 tendered into evidence report of Sh. R.S Ahluwalia, Insurer Investigator and report of Registering Authority, Ludhiana Ex.R-7 and as per report the offending vehicle car BMW bearing registration no.PB-10-CV-4000 registered in the name of respondent no.2 Atul Traders, Copy of registration certificate of the car BMW bearing registration no.PB-10-CV-4000 as Ex.R-8 which reflects the name of respondent no.2 Atul Traders as registered owner, Report of Licensing Authority, Ludhiana as Ex.R-9 and as per report driving license no.PB1020110231369 stands in the name of respondent no.1 Atul Bansal, Copy of driving license no.PB1020110231369 of respondent no.1 Atul Bansal as Ex.R-10 and Certified copy of Insurance Policy as Ex.R-11 of the offending car BMW bearing registration no.PB-10-CV-4000 and respondent no.2 was the holder of the said policy. Thereafter Ld counsel for respondent no.3 closed the evidence. 9.I have heard the contentions putforth by Ld counsel for the parties and also gone through the record with their able assistance and Rajni Dua & Another Vs. Atul Bansal & Others 6 my issue wise findings are as under: ISSUE NO.5 & 6 :- 10.Onus to prove these issues was on respondent no.3 and in this regard respondent no.3 did not lead any oral evidence. However he tendered into evidence report of Sh. R.S Ahluwalia, Insurer Investigator and report of Registering Authority, Ludhiana Ex.R-7 and as per report the offending vehicle car BMW bearing registration no.PB-10-CV-4000 registered in the name of respondent no.2 Atul Traders, Copy of registration certificate of the car BMW bearing registration no.PB-10-CV-4000 as Ex.R-8 which reflects the name of respondent no.2 Atul Traders as registered owner, Report of Licensing Authority, Ludhiana as Ex.R-9 and as per report driving license no.PB1020110231369 stands in the name of respondent no.1 Atul Bansal, Copy of driving license no.PB1020110231369 of respondent no.1 Atul Bansal as Ex.R-10 and Certified copy of Insurance Policy as Ex.R-11 of the offending car BMW bearing registration no.PB-10-CV- 4000 and respondent no.2 was the holder of the said policy which was valid from 09.01.2014 to 08.01.2015. Perusal of Insurance Policy goes to show that when the alleged accident took place ie on 25/26.10.2014 the offending vehicle bearing no.PB-10-CV-4000 was insured with respondent no.3 and respondent no.2 was the registered owner of the said vehicle at the time of alleged accident. Respondent no.1 was having a valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident. Therefore, as a result of aforesaid discussion, the issue no.5 & 6 are decided accordingly against respondent no.3 as the offending Rajni Dua & Another Vs. Atul Bansal & Others 7 vehicle was insured with respondent no.3 at the time of alleged accident. ISSUE NO.3 & 4 11.In view of discussion held on above issues, it cannot be said that the present petition is bad for non-joinder and mis-joinder of the parties and is not maintainable. In order to rebut the claim of claimants, respondents did not examine any witness qua these issues. The petition is well maintainable, so these issues are held against the respondents. ISSUE NO.1 & 2 12.Both these issues are taken together being interconnected and inter-related. Onus to prove these issues was upon claimant and in this regard claimant stepped into the witness box as CW-1 and tendered into evidence her duly sworn affidavit Ex.CA reiterated the entire version of claim petition that how and in what manner the accident took place in which her son Rajat Dua had died. She further deposed that deceased was a young man of 24 years old and was hale and hearty at the time of his death. The deceased was working as Salesman in M/s Fashion Yug situated at Gujjarwal road, Ludhiana and also doing his own commission agent work. The total income of the deceased from the said work was around 3.00 Lacs per annum. The deceased was at the beginning of his career and he could have earned much more that what he was earning at the time of his death. The claimants have lost their only son and their only hope for the future. The claimants have only dependent on the earning of the deceased. Postmortem of deceased Rajat Dua was conducted at Civil Hospital, Ludhiana. She Rajni Dua & Another Vs. Atul Bansal & Others 8 also placed on record certified copy of Postmortem report as Ex.C-2. The matter was reported to the police of P.S Sarabha Nagar, Ludhiana and FIR no.228 dated 29.10.2014 under Section 279, 304-A IPC was registered against the respondent no.1, certified copy of FIR is Ex.C-1, V oter ID card of deceased Rajat Dua as Ex.C-3. She has also placed on record her V oter ID card as Ex.C-4. Ld counsel for respondents cross- examined the said witness at length but nothing advantageous could be elicited from her mouth which could be beneficial to the respondents. Claimant further examined Nitin Garg as CW-2 and Rakesh Kumar Dua as CW-3 who deposed on the similar lines of CW-1. Ld counsel for respondents cross-examined the said witnesses at length but nothing advantageous could be elicited from their mouth which could be beneficial to the respondents. 13.The evidence, adduced on record, by the claimants, as discussed above, has gone un-rebutted and unchallenged, as the respondent no.1 & 2, (driver & owner) of the offending vehicle did not lead any cogent and reliable evidence to controvert the evidence led by claimants. In cross-examination of the witnesses examined by the claimant, nothing favourable to the respondents could be extracted. It is settled that registration of criminal case against the driver of the offending vehicle for causing accident by rash and negligent driving is the prima facie proof that the accident was the result of rashness and negligence on his part as settled Moreover, it is settled that registration of criminal case against the driver of the offending vehicle for causing accident by rash and negligent driving is the prima facie proof that the accident was the Rajni Dua & Another Vs. Atul Bansal & Others 9 result of rashness and negligence on his part as settled in Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Shyam and others 1993 (2) P.L.R. 109 . So, in view of the above discussed un-rebutted oral as well as documentary evidence led on record by the claimants, which is found to be sufficient and reliable, coupled with the legal position detailed above, it has been fully proved on the record that Rajat Dua had died in an accident caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle ie car bearing registration no.PB-10-CV-4000 being driven by respondent no.1. 14.Ld counsel for respondent no.3 argued that claimants failed to examine any eye witness of the alleged accident that the offending vehicle being driven by respondent no.1 rashly & negligently. He took a plea that the offending vehicle is not involved in the alleged accident. But perusal of record goes to show that the offending vehicle ie Car BMW bearing registration no.PB-10-CV-4000 after the accident fully damaged and broken into two pieces which itself speaks that it was driven by respondent no.1 on very high speed in rash & negligent manner. It is proved on record that the offending vehicle was driven by respondent no.1 and respondent no.2 is the registered owner of the said vehicle. No cogent and reliable evidence has been led by respondent no.2 in order to show that offending vehicle was not involved in the accident or it was not being driven rashly and negligently by respondent no.1 at the time of alleged accident. The FIR Ex.C1 lodged against the driver/respondent no.1 elucidates that respondent no.1 was driving the offending vehicle and it also corroborates the fact that Rajni Dua & Another Vs. Atul Bansal & Others 10 accident happened due to rash and negligent driving of the said vehicle. From the above said documents, it stands proved that Rajat Dua died due to the accident caused by respondent no.1 while driving the offending vehicle rashly and negligently. Even Post-Mortem report Ex.C-2 also explains this fact. 15. Averting to the quantum of compensation to be awarded to the claimants. The claimants have claimed Rs.50,00,000/- as compensation. It was only with a sole object to bring about uniformity & consistency in awarding compensation that Hon'ble Apex Court of India gave clear cut directions to various Tribunals/Courts working throughout length & breadth of this country to work on various determining factors. Hon'ble apex Court while making above said observations in a celebrated judgment titled Sarla Verma and others versus Delhi Transport Corporation & Others 2009 ACJ 1298 , culled the observations made by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Trilok Chandra's case as follows : “We thought it necessary to reiterate the method of working out 'just' compensation because, of late, we have noticed from the awards made by Tribunals and Courts that the principle on which the multiplier method was developed has been lost sight of and once again a hybrid method based on the subjectivity of Tribunal/court has surfaced, introducing uncertainty and lack of reasonable uniformity in the matter of determination of compensation. It must be realized that the Tribunal/Court has to determine a fair amount of compensation Rajni Dua & Another Vs. Atul Bansal & Others 11 awardable to the victim of an accident which must be proportionate to the injury caused”. 16.In National Insurance Co. Limited versus Pushpa Rana and other 2009 ACJ 287 Hon'ble Delhi High Court has held that certified copies of criminal Court record such as FIR, recovery memo and mechanical inspection report are sufficient proof to reach the conclusion that driver was driving the vehicle rashly. Proceedings under M.V Act are not akin to proceedings in a civil suit and hence strict rules of evidence are not required to be followed in this regard. 17. In view of the ratio laid down in aforementioned authorities, after considering the entire material on record, I am of the view that deceased Rajat Dua suffered fatal injuries in an accident caused by driver respondent no.1 by driving the vehicle ie car bearing registration no.PB-10-CV-4000 in a rash and negligent manner. Accordingly, issues No.1 & 2 are decided in favor of claimants and against the respondents. 18.Claimants have claimed compensation to the tune of Rs.50,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty Lakh only). This is how in this exercise various steps are required to be taken by the Tribunal very well spelt out by the Hon'ble Court in the above stated decision. Basically, the Tribunal had to look out three things which of course are required to be established by the claimant party. These are : age of the deceased, income of the deceased and number of dependents. In addition to this, Tribunal has also to determine the loss of dependency and it has to work out the same after taking into consideration additions/deductions to be made to find out the income of the deceased. Further the Rajni Dua & Another Vs. Atul Bansal & Others 12 deductions to be made towards the personal and living expenses of the deceased and finally multiplier to be applied in reference with the age of the deceased. It was also with an object to standardize all these determinants that Hon'ble Supreme Court had laid out entire criteria so as to bring about uniformity in the awards passed by the various Tribunals across the country in motor accident claims cases. In order to arrive at exact amount, three steps are adopted by the Tribunal. In step No.1 multiplicand is to be ascertained and for doing so the income of the deceased per annum is calculated after deducting income tax out of which other deductions to be made in regard to the amount which the deceased would have spent for personal and living expenses and balance was to be contributed towards all the dependents of the family members. In second step multiplier is to be ascertained and for this purpose also the learned Apex Court laid out detailed criteria depending upon the age of the deceased based upon the number of years he would have lived or worked but for unfortunate accident and then final step is to calculate the actual compensation. 19.Applying this yardstick to the facts & circumstances of the instant claim petition, claimant has claimed that deceased was 24 years old. In the report of postmortem age of the deceased is mentioned as 24 years old. In the given circumstances, I take his age as 24 years on the date of his death. In that event, the suitable multiplier would be 18. 20.Further if we take into consideration various averments the deceased was stated to be working as Salesman in M/s Fashion Yug situated at Gujjarwal Road, Ludhiana and was also doing his own Rajni Dua & Another Vs. Atul Bansal & Others 13 commission agent work and earns Rs.3,00,000/- per month. In order to prove his earnings, claimant has proved on record Income Tax return of the deceased for the year 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2012-13. As per last return of year 2012-13 the annual income of the deceased was shown as Rs.1,72,800/- and as per calculation it came to be Rs.14,400/- per month. Deceased Rajat Dua was died in the Motor Vehicular accident in the year 2014. Thus I take, the monthly income of deceased Rajat Dua as Rs.15,500/-. Deceased is survived by Rajni Dua-claimant no.1 (mother) and Rakesh Kumar Dua (father). 21.It will be just and fair and equitable in the absence of evidence to the contrary for higher expenses to award at least a sum of Rs.25,000/- as funeral expenses. 22.Finally, the following calculation will give us amount of compensation to be awarded to the claimants : S.No. HEADS CALCULATION (i) Salary/earning Rs.15,500/- per month + 50% future prospectus =Rs.23,250/- per month. (ii) 1/2 deducted as personal expenses of the deceasedRs.23,250/- minus Rs.11,625/- = Rs.11,625/- per month. (iii) Compensation after multiplier of 18 is appliedRs.25,11,000/- (iv) Funeral expensesRs.25,000-00 (v) Love & AffectionRs.1,00,000/- each (v) Total Rs. 27,36,000/- Rajni Dua & Another Vs. Atul Bansal & Others 14 23.In view of above discussion, issue under discussion is held in favour of claimants to the extent stated above. RELIEF 24.In view of my findings upon the above said issues, present claim petition succeeds with costs and claimants are awarded compensation to the tune of Rs.27,36,000/- along with interest rate @ 7.50% from the date of filing claim petition ie 17.08.2015 till the decision of the case, to be paid by respon dent no.3. This amount is to be paid by the respondent no.3 within two months from the receipt of Award failing which claimants are also entitled future interest at the rate of 6% per annum, till the realization of total amount. The Award amount shall be apportioned amongst the claimants as under:- (i) Claimant No.1 Rajni Dua (Mother) =( 50% ) (ii) Claimant No.2 Rakesh Dua (Father) = ( 50%) 25.In view of latest decision in Civil Revision No.7407 of 2010 by the Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court dated 03.06.2011 in case 'Jyoti Burmi Vs. Anusandeep Burmi' , now it is desirable that if claimants have any account in the Bank, then they will intimate to this court within one month after receipt of certified copy of judgment. Now, respondent no.3 is ordered to pay the award amount directly in the account of claimant no.1 & 2 by way of RTGS or by way of draft or cross cheque in the name of claimant no.1 & 2 so that cumbersome procedure of deposit and withdrawal from the court could be avoided by both the parties to save their own time as well as precious time of the court.

Rajiv Abhi, Adv counsel for respondent no. 3 AWARD: 1.The claimants have filed the present claim petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act, (here-in-after referred to as the “Act”) for the grant of compensation to the tune of Rs.50.00 lacs only along- with 24 per cent interest per Annum and costs against the respondents with regard to death of deceased Rajat Dua son of Rakesh Kumar Dua in motor vehicular accident, caused by respondent No.1 on 25/26.10.2014. 2. The present petiti on has been moved on the averments that on intervening night of 25/26.10.2014 deceased Rajat Dua was sitting on the front seat along with driver, Gagandeep Sharma was on the back seat which was driven by the respondent no.1 in rash and negligent manner and without following the traffic rules and regulations and struck the car in a tree due to that Rajat Dua and Gagandeep Sharma were died on the spot. The alleged accident was witnessed by Sh. Nitin Narang, Sh. Robin Virmani, Sh. Kashmir Lal and Sh. Des Raj. The deceased Rajat Dua sustained multiple and grievous injuries on head, chest, abdomen and leg and those proved to be fatal and he died on the spot. The deceased was working as Salesman in M/s Fashion Yug situated at Gujjarwal road, Ludhiana and also doing his own commission agent work. The total income of the deceased from the Rajni Dua & Another Vs. Atul Bansal & Others 3 said work was around 3.00 Lacs per annum. Postmortem of deceased Rajat Dua was conducted at Civil Hospital, Ludhiana. The matter was reported to the police of P.S Sarabha Nagar, Ludhiana and FIR no.228 dated 29.10.2014 under Section 279, 304-A IPC was registered against the respondent no.1 on the statement of mother of other deceased namely Gagandeep Sharma. Thereafter, prayer that the claim petition of the claimants be accepted and compensation to the tune of Rs.50 lacs be awarded to the claimant along-with interest rate of 24% per annum from the date of accident, on account of death in the Motor Vehicular Accident was made. 3. Upon being put to notice, Sh. Amandeep Singh Bhanot, Advocate appeared on behalf of respondents no.1 & 2 whereas Sh. Rajiv Abhi, Advocate appeared on behalf of respondent no.3 4. The respondents no.1 & 2 filed written statement jointly and raised preliminary objection that claim petition filed by the claimants is not maintainable in the present form. The claim petition is based on false, frivolous and concocted facts. On merits all other averments have been denied and prayer for dismissal of the claim petition has been made. 5.The respondent no.3 filed separate written statement and raised preliminary objection that the claim petition filed by the claimants is not maintainable. The present claim petition is bad for non-joinder of the necessary parties. The respondent no.3 is not responsible for any compensation as the respondent no.1 driver of the offending vehicle car BMW bearing registration no.PB-10-CV-4000 did not hold valid and Rajni Dua & Another Vs. Atul Bansal & Others 4 effective driving license on the alleged date of accident. The offending vehicle car bearing registration no.PB-10-CV-4000 did not have valid registration certificate and fitness certificate at the time of alleged accident. On merits all other averments have been denied and prayer for dismissal of the claim petition has been made. 6. Replication was not preferred and from the pleadings of the parties following issues were framed:- (i) Whether deceased Rajat Dua died in a Motor Vehicle Accident caused by respondent no.1 while driving car BMW bearing registration no.PB-10-CV-4000 on the intervening night of 25/26.10.2014 in rashly and negligently? OPP (ii) Whether claimant is entitled to compensation if so, to what amount and from whom? OPP (iii)Whether petition is not maintainable? OPR (iv)Whether the petition is bad for non-joinder and mis- joinder of the parties? OPR (v)Whether respondent no.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident ? OPR(3) (vi)Whether the offending vehicle did not have a valid RC and fitness certificate at the time of alleged accident, if so its effect? OPR (3) (vii)Relief 7.In order to prove her claim petition, claimant herself stepped into the witness box as CW-1 and deposed through her duly sworn affidavit Ex.CA and tendered documents Ex.C-1 to Ex.C-4. She further Rajni Dua & Another Vs. Atul Bansal & Others 5 examined Nitin Garg as CW-2 who deposed through his duly sworn affidavit Ex.CB and Rakesh Kumar as CW-3 who deposed through his duly sworn affidavit Ex.C-3 and tendered documents Ex.C-6 to Ex.C-9. Thereafter, learned counsel for claimant closed the claimant evidence. 8.In order to rebut the evidence of claimants, respondents did not adduce any oral evidence. However, Ld counsel for respondents no.1 & 2 tendered into evidence certified copy of DDR no.37 dated 26.10.2014 as Ex.R-1 and closed the evidence on behalf of respondents no.1 & 2. On the other hand, Ld counsel for respondents no.3 tendered into evidence report of Sh. R.S Ahluwalia, Insurer Investigator and report of Registering Authority, Ludhiana Ex.R-7 and as per report the offending vehicle car BMW bearing registration no.PB-10-CV-4000 registered in the name of respondent no.2 Atul Traders, Copy of registration certificate of the car BMW bearing registration no.PB-10-CV-4000 as Ex.R-8 which reflects the name of respondent no.2 Atul Traders as registered owner, Report of Licensing Authority, Ludhiana as Ex.R-9 and as per report driving license no.PB1020110231369 stands in the name of respondent no.1 Atul Bansal, Copy of driving license no.PB1020110231369 of respondent no.1 Atul Bansal as Ex.R-10 and Certified copy of Insurance Policy as Ex.R-11 of the offending car BMW bearing registration no.PB-10-CV-4000 and respondent no.2 was the holder of the said policy. Thereafter Ld counsel for respondent no.3 closed the evidence. 9.I have heard the contentions putforth by Ld counsel for the parties and also gone through the record with their able assistance and Rajni Dua & Another Vs. Atul Bansal & Others 6 my issue wise findings are as under: ISSUE NO.5 & 6 :- 10.Onus to prove these issues was on respondent no.3 and in this regard respondent no.3 did not lead any oral evidence. However he tendered into evidence report of Sh. R.S Ahluwalia, Insurer Investigator and report of Registering Authority, Ludhiana Ex.R-7 and as per report the offending vehicle car BMW bearing registration no.PB-10-CV-4000 registered in the name of respondent no.2 Atul Traders, Copy of registration certificate of the car BMW bearing registration no.PB-10-CV-4000 as Ex.R-8 which reflects the name of respondent no.2 Atul Traders as registered owner, Report of Licensing Authority, Ludhiana as Ex.R-9 and as per report driving license no.PB1020110231369 stands in the name of respondent no.1 Atul Bansal, Copy of driving license no.PB1020110231369 of respondent no.1 Atul Bansal as Ex.R-10 and Certified copy of Insurance Policy as Ex.R-11 of the offending car BMW bearing registration no.PB-10-CV- 4000 and respondent no.2 was the holder of the said policy which was valid from 09.01.2014 to 08.01.2015. Perusal of Insurance Policy goes to show that when the alleged accident took place ie on 25/26.10.2014 the offending vehicle bearing no.PB-10-CV-4000 was insured with respondent no.3 and respondent no.2 was the registered owner of the said vehicle at the time of alleged accident. Respondent no.1 was having a valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident. Therefore, as a result of aforesaid discussion, the issue no.5 & 6 are decided accordingly against respondent no.3 as the offending Rajni Dua & Another Vs. Atul Bansal & Others 7 vehicle was insured with respondent no.3 at the time of alleged accident. ISSUE NO.3 & 4 11.In view of discussion held on above issues, it cannot be said that the present petition is bad for non-joinder and mis-joinder of the parties and is not maintainable. In order to rebut the claim of claimants, respondents did not examine any witness qua these issues. The petition is well maintainable, so these issues are held against the respondents. ISSUE NO.1 & 2 12.Both these issues are taken together being interconnected and inter-related. Onus to prove these issues was upon claimant and in this regard claimant stepped into the witness box as CW-1 and tendered into evidence her duly sworn affidavit Ex.CA reiterated the entire version of claim petition that how and in what manner the accident took place in which her son Rajat Dua had died. She further deposed that deceased was a young man of 24 years old and was hale and hearty at the time of his death. The deceased was working as Salesman in M/s Fashion Yug situated at Gujjarwal road, Ludhiana and also doing his own commission agent work. The total income of the deceased from the said work was around 3.00 Lacs per annum. The deceased was at the beginning of his career and he could have earned much more that what he was earning at the time of his death. The claimants have lost their only son and their only hope for the future. The claimants have only dependent on the earning of the deceased. Postmortem of deceased Rajat Dua was conducted at Civil Hospital, Ludhiana. She Rajni Dua & Another Vs. Atul Bansal & Others 8 also placed on record certified copy of Postmortem report as Ex.C-2. The matter was reported to the police of P.S Sarabha Nagar, Ludhiana and FIR no.228 dated 29.10.2014 under Section 279, 304-A IPC was registered against the respondent no.1, certified copy of FIR is Ex.C-1, V oter ID card of deceased Rajat Dua as Ex.C-3. She has also placed on record her V oter ID card as Ex.C-4. Ld counsel for respondents cross- examined the said witness at length but nothing advantageous could be elicited from her mouth which could be beneficial to the respondents. Claimant further examined Nitin Garg as CW-2 and Rakesh Kumar Dua as CW-3 who deposed on the similar lines of CW-1. Ld counsel for respondents cross-examined the said witnesses at length but nothing advantageous could be elicited from their mouth which could be beneficial to the respondents. 13.The evidence, adduced on record, by the claimants, as discussed above, has gone un-rebutted and unchallenged, as the respondent no.1 & 2, (driver & owner) of the offending vehicle did not lead any cogent and reliable evidence to controvert the evidence led by claimants. In cross-examination of the witnesses examined by the claimant, nothing favourable to the respondents could be extracted. It is settled that registration of criminal case against the driver of the offending vehicle for causing accident by rash and negligent driving is the prima facie proof that the accident was the result of rashness and negligence on his part as settled Moreover, it is settled that registration of criminal case against the driver of the offending vehicle for causing accident by rash and negligent driving is the prima facie proof that the accident was the Rajni Dua & Another Vs. Atul Bansal & Others 9 result of rashness and negligence on his part as settled in Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Shyam and others 1993 (2) P.L.R. 109 . So, in view of the above discussed un-rebutted oral as well as documentary evidence led on record by the claimants, which is found to be sufficient and reliable, coupled with the legal position detailed above, it has been fully proved on the record that Rajat Dua had died in an accident caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle ie car bearing registration no.PB-10-CV-4000 being driven by respondent no.1. 14.Ld counsel for respondent no.3 argued that claimants failed to examine any eye witness of the alleged accident that the offending vehicle being driven by respondent no.1 rashly & negligently. He took a plea that the offending vehicle is not involved in the alleged accident. But perusal of record goes to show that the offending vehicle ie Car BMW bearing registration no.PB-10-CV-4000 after the accident fully damaged and broken into two pieces which itself speaks that it was driven by respondent no.1 on very high speed in rash & negligent manner. It is proved on record that the offending vehicle was driven by respondent no.1 and respondent no.2 is the registered owner of the said vehicle. No cogent and reliable evidence has been led by respondent no.2 in order to show that offending vehicle was not involved in the accident or it was not being driven rashly and negligently by respondent no.1 at the time of alleged accident. The FIR Ex.C1 lodged against the driver/respondent no.1 elucidates that respondent no.1 was driving the offending vehicle and it also corroborates the fact that Rajni Dua & Another Vs. Atul Bansal & Others 10 accident happened due to rash and negligent driving of the said vehicle. From the above said documents, it stands proved that Rajat Dua died due to the accident caused by respondent no.1 while driving the offending vehicle rashly and negligently. Even Post-Mortem report Ex.C-2 also explains this fact. 15. Averting to the quantum of compensation to be awarded to the claimants. The claimants have claimed Rs.50,00,000/- as compensation. It was only with a sole object to bring about uniformity & consistency in awarding compensation that Hon'ble Apex Court of India gave clear cut directions to various Tribunals/Courts working throughout length & breadth of this country to work on various determining factors. Hon'ble apex Court while making above said observations in a celebrated judgment titled Sarla Verma and others versus Delhi Transport Corporation & Others 2009 ACJ 1298 , culled the observations made by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Trilok Chandra's case as follows : “We thought it necessary to reiterate the method of working out 'just' compensation because, of late, we have noticed from the awards made by Tribunals and Courts that the principle on which the multiplier method was developed has been lost sight of and once again a hybrid method based on the subjectivity of Tribunal/court has surfaced, introducing uncertainty and lack of reasonable uniformity in the matter of determination of compensation. It must be realized that the Tribunal/Court has to determine a fair amount of compensation Rajni Dua & Another Vs. Atul Bansal & Others 11 awardable to the victim of an accident which must be proportionate to the injury caused”. 16.In National Insurance Co. Limited versus Pushpa Rana and other 2009 ACJ 287 Hon'ble Delhi High Court has held that certified copies of criminal Court record such as FIR, recovery memo and mechanical inspection report are sufficient proof to reach the conclusion that driver was driving the vehicle rashly. Proceedings under M.V Act are not akin to proceedings in a civil suit and hence strict rules of evidence are not required to be followed in this regard. 17. In view of the ratio laid down in aforementioned authorities, after considering the entire material on record, I am of the view that deceased Rajat Dua suffered fatal injuries in an accident caused by driver respondent no.1 by driving the vehicle ie car bearing registration no.PB-10-CV-4000 in a rash and negligent manner. Accordingly, issues No.1 & 2 are decided in favor of claimants and against the respondents. 18.Claimants have claimed compensation to the tune of Rs.50,00,000/- (Rupees Fifty Lakh only). This is how in this exercise various steps are required to be taken by the Tribunal very well spelt out by the Hon'ble Court in the above stated decision. Basically, the Tribunal had to look out three things which of course are required to be established by the claimant party. These are : age of the deceased, income of the deceased and number of dependents. In addition to this, Tribunal has also to determine the loss of dependency and it has to work out the same after taking into consideration additions/deductions to be made to find out the income of the deceased. Further the Rajni Dua & Another Vs. Atul Bansal & Others 12 deductions to be made towards the personal and living expenses of the deceased and finally multiplier to be applied in reference with the age of the deceased. It was also with an object to standardize all these determinants that Hon'ble Supreme Court had laid out entire criteria so as to bring about uniformity in the awards passed by the various Tribunals across the country in motor accident claims cases. In order to arrive at exact amount, three steps are adopted by the Tribunal. In step No.1 multiplicand is to be ascertained and for doing so the income of the deceased per annum is calculated after deducting income tax out of which other deductions to be made in regard to the amount which the deceased would have spent for personal and living expenses and balance was to be contributed towards all the dependents of the family members. In second step multiplier is to be ascertained and for this purpose also the learned Apex Court laid out detailed criteria depending upon the age of the deceased based upon the number of years he would have lived or worked but for unfortunate accident and then final step is to calculate the actual compensation. 19.Applying this yardstick to the facts & circumstances of the instant claim petition, claimant has claimed that deceased was 24 years old. In the report of postmortem age of the deceased is mentioned as 24 years old. In the given circumstances, I take his age as 24 years on the date of his death. In that event, the suitable multiplier would be 18. 20.Further if we take into consideration various averments the deceased was stated to be working as Salesman in M/s Fashion Yug situated at Gujjarwal Road, Ludhiana and was also doing his own Rajni Dua & Another Vs. Atul Bansal & Others 13 commission agent work and earns Rs.3,00,000/- per month. In order to prove his earnings, claimant has proved on record Income Tax return of the deceased for the year 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2012-13. As per last return of year 2012-13 the annual income of the deceased was shown as Rs.1,72,800/- and as per calculation it came to be Rs.14,400/- per month. Deceased Rajat Dua was died in the Motor Vehicular accident in the year 2014. Thus I take, the monthly income of deceased Rajat Dua as Rs.15,500/-. Deceased is survived by Rajni Dua-claimant no.1 (mother) and Rakesh Kumar Dua (father). 21.It will be just and fair and equitable in the absence of evidence to the contrary for higher expenses to award at least a sum of Rs.25,000/- as funeral expenses. 22.Finally, the following calculation will give us amount of compensation to be awarded to the claimants : S.No. HEADS CALCULATION (i) Salary/earning Rs.15,500/- per month + 50% future prospectus =Rs.23,250/- per month. (ii) 1/2 deducted as personal expenses of the deceasedRs.23,250/- minus Rs.11,625/- = Rs.11,625/- per month. (iii) Compensation after multiplier of 18 is appliedRs.25,11,000/- (iv) Funeral expensesRs.25,000-00 (v) Love & AffectionRs.1,00,000/- each (v) Total Rs. 27,36,000/- Rajni Dua & Another Vs. Atul Bansal & Others 14 23.In view of above discussion, issue under discussion is held in favour of claimants to the extent stated above. RELIEF 24.In view of my findings upon the above said issues, present claim petition succeeds with costs and claimants are awarded compensation to the tune of Rs.27,36,000/- along with interest rate @ 7.50% from the date of filing claim petition ie 17.08.2015 till the decision of the case, to be paid by respon dent no.3. This amount is to be paid by the respondent no.3 within two months from the receipt of Award failing which claimants are also entitled future interest at the rate of 6% per annum, till the realization of total amount. The Award amount shall be apportioned amongst the claimants as under:- (i) Claimant No.1 Rajni Dua (Mother) =( 50% ) (ii) Claimant No.2 Rakesh Dua (Father) = ( 50%) 25.In view of latest decision in Civil Revision No.7407 of 2010 by the Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court dated 03.06.2011 in case 'Jyoti Burmi Vs. Anusandeep Burmi' , now it is desirable that if claimants have any account in the Bank, then they will intimate to this court within one month after receipt of certified copy of judgment. Now, respondent no.3 is ordered to pay the award amount directly in the account of claimant no.1 & 2 by way of RTGS or by way of draft or cross cheque in the name of claimant no.1 & 2 so that cumbersome procedure of deposit and withdrawal from the court could be avoided by both the parties to save their own time as well as precious time of the court.

He averred in the petition that he is 61 years old and was running a Sanitary Shop under the name and style of M/s Punjab Water Supply, Gill Road, Ludhiana and was earning Rs. 30,000/- per month. On 30.5.2014 he was going on foot near Model Town Extension, Block-D, Ludhiana to look for a mechanic for repair of his Activa Scooter. It was about 8.15 P.M. By then a Mini Bus bearing registration No. PB-10-BM-1650 came from Arora Palace side. It was being driven by respondent No.1 in a rash and negligent manner and without blowing horn. It hit into the claimant throwing him on the road. He suffered multiple grievous injuries including fracture of skull, ankle and injuries on other parts of body. He firstly was taken to Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Ludhiana from where he was taken to DMC & H, Ludhiana where he remained admitted from 30.5.2014 till 1.4.2015 where his several brain surgeries were performed. He spent about Rs. 20 lacs on such treatment in DMC & H, Ludhiana. He still is under treatment and is advised special diet of Rs. 1500/- per day. FIR No.73 dated 4.6.2014 under Sections 279,337,338 IPC also was lodged regarding this accident with P.S. Model Town, Ludhiana. Offending Mini Bus is owned by respondent No.2 and is insured with respondent No.3. Due to these injuries, claimant is confined to bed and is unable to perform his daily routine. He is unable to earn his livelihood. His shop is lying 3 closed as his family members also remained held-up in attending him. He is a business man and was very ambitious towards his life. He was the bread earner of his family but by such accident and injuries, he has suffered collapsing of his future hopes. Hence this petition whereby he has sought compensation of Rs.90 lacs with interest from respondents jointly and severally. 2-Upon notice all three respondents appeared. Respondents No.1 and 2 filed their joint written statement controverting maintainability of this petition. On merits, they denied the entire version of petition but admitted that referred Mini Bus is insured with respondent No.3. With these averments, they sought dismissal of petition. 3-In separate written statement, respondent No.3 also denied if this petition is maintainable. It also controverted the averments of petition and sought its dismissal. 4-On such pleadings, following issues were framed on 12.12.2015: 1-Whether Arun Kumar Duggal received injury on account of rash and negligent driving by respondent No.1 while driving offending vehicle bearing No. PB-10BM-1650 on 30.5.2014? OPP 2-Whether the claimant(s) are legal representatives of the injured entitled for compensation, if so to what extent?OPP 3-Whether the claim petition is maintainable?OPP 4-Whether the offending vehicle i.e Mini Bus bearing No. PB- 10BM-1650 was not holding valid RC, fitness certificate or road( route) permit at the time of alleged accident?OPR(3) 4 5-Whether the respondent No.1was not holding a valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident? OPR(3) 6-Relief 5-To prove his version claimant examined PW1 Gurpreet Singh, Clerk-cum-Cashier from DMC & H, Ludhiana; PW2 Boota Singh, Assistant to Pharmacist from DMC & H, Ludhiana; PW3 Dr. Dipesh Batra; PW4 Jaswinder Singh,eyewitness; PW5 Suman Duggal and thereafter Ld counsel for claimant closed the evidence of claimant. 6-Respondents No.1 and 2 tendered documents Ex R2/A to EX R2/J and closed their evidence. 7-Respondent No.3 tendered documents Ex R1 to EX R10 and its remaining evidence was closed by order. 8-I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record . My issue-wise findings are as under:- ISSUES NO.1 AND 2. 9-Both these issues are interconnected, and, therefore, are being taken up together for disposal to avoid repetition of discussion. 10-To prove these issues, and statedly being unable to move and appear in court, claimant has examined his wife and next friend Suman Duggal as PW5 and son-in-law Jaswinder Singh, eyewitness, as PW4. To prove that above referred occurrence had taken place on 30.5.2015 at about 8.15 PM, near Model Town Extension, Block-D, Ludhiana, and if it was caused by rash and negligent driving of above referred Mini Bus No. PB-10-BM-1650 by respondent No.1, PW4 has stepped into witness box 5 as eyewitness. In his examination-in-chief in this regard he has reiterated the entire version of petition while stating that he was accompanying his father-in-law on Activa Scooter No.PB-10-CP-9850 but it broke down and claimant went ahead on foot to look for a mechanic by which time abovesaid Bus came and inevitable ill-fated occurrence took place. In this regard PW4 also got lodged FIR No.73 dated 4.6.2014 against respondent No.1 with P.S. Model Town, Ludhiana. He proved a copy thereof as ExP805. His cross-examination conducted by respondents more or less is suggestive only where all suggestions coming from their side stood denied by the witness. However, it came in his cross-examination that he is a Lawyer by profession and despite the involved accident having been taken place on 30.5.2014 this fellow did not inform the police before 4.6.2014. He tried to explain this gap away by stating that the Hospital authorities had informed the police. Fact remains that FIR Ex P 805 has been lodged by him, though after some delay. Mere such delay, in this inquiry under Motor Vehicles Act cannot be fatal one especially when nothing else could come in cross-examination of this witness PW4 shattering his veracity. He is son-in-law of injured claimant and is a natural witness who could accompany claimant in the late evening on the day of occurrence. Another witness examined by claimant is his wife and next friend Suman Duggal who deposed as PW5. Her examination-in- chief is on the lines of version in petition. In cross-examination she admitted that she is not an eyewitness to the alleged occurrence. Her statement, therefore, is not relevant to adjudicate if involved occurrence 6 had taken place and if it was caused due to rash and negligent driving of above said Mini Bus by respondent No.1 11-It is relevant to note here that as per facts in petition and as per statement of PW4 it was respondent No.1 who was at the wheels of abovesaid Mini Bus at the time of alleged occurrence. Latter has chosen not to appear in the witness box and depose on the lines of his version in the written statement. Mere denials therein are not sufficient when are not supported by any positive evidence on his part. He could not dare to face the cross-examination from claimant party. He was the best person who could shatter the version of claimant regarding rashness/negligence in driving of abovesaid Mini Bus at the referred time and place by him. Therefore, adverse inference has to be drawn against him which speaks out that the denials on the part of respondent No.1 in his written are untrue and inconsequential. The statement of PW4 having gone unrebutted in this regard, consequently, proves that it was respondent No.1 who had driven abovesaid Mini Bus bearing No.PB-10-BM-1650 in a rash and negligent manner on 30.5.2014 at about 8.15 PM in the area of Model Town Extension, Ludhiana causing collision with claimant. It is though not specifically admitted by respondents No.1 and 2 in their written statement that this offending Mini Bus is owned by respondent No.2 but they themselves tendered on file documents like insurance policy of said Bus as Ex R2/A, permit of said Bus as EX R2/B, receipts of payment of road tax as EX R2/C and EX R2/D, verification of RC of said Bus in the name of respondent No.2 as Ex R2/E, route permit 7 verification report EX R2/G supported by copy of valid driving licence of respondent No.1 as EX R2/J. Respondent No.3 also brought on file documents corresponding to these documents as EX R1 to EX R10. Therefore, it is obvious from these documents that respondent No.1 had a valid driving licence, verification of which is EX R1 on record, on the day of occurrence and involved Bus belongs to respondent No.2 and that it was duly insured with respondent No.3. All three respondents ,therefore, are jointly and severally liable to answer the claim of claimant in this claim petition. 12-To prove the quantum of income being made by the claimant every month, these PW4 Jaswinder Singh, eyewitness, and PW5 Suman Duggal, wife and next friend, have stated in their examinations-in-chief that claimant had been running a Sanitary shop under the name and style of Punjab Water Supply, Gill Road and was earning Rs. 30,000/- per month. They also deposed that claimant is income tax assessee. PW5 has brought on file Income tax returns of claimant, for the years 2011-2012 to 2014-2015, as Ex R800 to EX R803 wherein the average income of claimant is shown as Rs. 2 Lacs. However, these Income tax returns are not supported by any other proof that claimant has been running such shop under the name and style of M/s Punjab Water Supply. These self suffering Income Tax Returns by themselves , therefore, do not prove that claimant has been running such shop or his earning from there is about Rs. 30,000/- per month. No bill book or purchase order or purchase bills pertaining to articles being purchased/sold in that shop have come on 8 file. I, therefore, feel hesitant in accepting these Income-Tax Returns as the sole proof of such livelihood of claimant and his income therefrom. As would be the outcome of my discussion recorded in immediate preceding para above,and by discarding the Income-Tax Returns EX P 800 to Ex 803 as sole proof of livelihood or earning of claimant, the Tribunal is left only with the option of applying the method of approximation to assess the monthly income of claimant. He is aged 61 years. No proof of his educational qualification or any professional knowledge is on file. In these constraints the monthly income of claimant is assessed as Rs. 5000/- per month. 13-Claimant has examined PW3 Dr. Dipesh Batra from department of Neuro Surgery, DMC & H, Ludhiana whose detailed examination-in-chief, supported by medical record EX PW3/1 to EX PW3/4, unrebuttedly shows that due to suffering of head injury and other injuries in road side accident on 30.4.2014 ( the one under reference) claimant was admitted in that Hospital on that day. Due to severe head injury, he was operated upon twice and was discharged on 27.9.2014. He again was admitted in that Hospital on 12.10.2014, was operated upon and was discharged from there on 11.11.2014. He again was admitted in Hospital on 5.2.2015 for treatment of abovesaid injuries and was operated upon 3rd time. Now he is receiving treatment as Out-Door-Patient. This witness categorically, and in no uncertain words, stated that throughout this treatment i.e from 30.5.2014 onwards, the claimant remained in and still is in Coma. This witness also proved original disability certificate of 9 claimant as EXPW3/5 mentioning that the physical disability of claimant is 100% and he requires help of an attendant round the clock. This witness was cross-examined by respondents who unsuccessfully tried to extract from his mouth that the disability certificate of claimant brought by him and proved on file as EX PW3/5 was procured one, the DMC & H Authorities were not competent to issue it and that it was only a photocopy. This witness clearly stated in his examination-in-chief that the one produced on record as ExPW3/5 is the original disability certificate. He also explained in his cross-examination that a photocopy thereof is on record which he has brought. He denied if this is procured one. I do not find any reason to disbelieve the statement of this witness regarding the treatment given to claimant and the disability certificate Ex P3/5 issued to him reflecting extent of injury/damage he has suffered. There is nothing in cross-examination of this PW3 that would even suggest that claimant is not in Coma or that he was not operated upon for 4 times. Contention of Ld. Counsel for respondents that this witness did not have carbon copy of said disability certificate can be of no consequence when the proforma of this certificate is computer generated one and has been filled in manually. It is signed by PW3. He has owned its contents as correct. This certificate, therefore, cannot be discarded. 14-The income of claimant has been assessed as Rs.5,000/- per month. He is in Coma and is totally disabled to work for gain. He has been suffering such loss of Rs. 5,000/- per month. His annual income comes to Rs. 60,000/- . He is aged 61 years. As per Judgment 'Smt.Sarla 10 Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Anr. 2009 (3) Recent Civil Reports 77' , multiplier of 7 is to be applied. The compensation award-able to claimant on this count comes to Rs.4,20,000/-.It is held accordingly. Respondents are jointly and severally are liable to pay this amount to him. 15-PW1 examined by claimant is Gurpreet Singh, Clerk-cum- Cashier from DMC & H, Ludhiana who proved medical record as EX P1 to EX P41 reflecting the expenses borne by claimant party on the treatment of injured claimant. This witness detailed out that this injured firstly was admitted in abovesaid Hospital on 30.5.2014 and was discharged on 27.9.2014. He again remained admitted there from 12.10.2014 till 11.11.2014. He then remained hospitalized there from 31.12.2014 till 25.1.2015 and lastly from 5.2.2015 till 10.2.2015. Cross- examination of this witness is formal. PW2 is Boota Singh, Assistant Pharmacist in the said Hospital, who also proved medical bills EX P42 to EX P699 relating to injured claimant. His cross-examination is also formal in nature. 16-PW5 Suman Duggal wife and next friend of claimant proved remaining medical bills relating to claimant as EX P 700 to Ex P 798 which again have gone unrebutted. These bills are worth Rs.12,88,779/-. But these bills also include bills Ex P714 to Ex P723 worth Rs. 2 lacs allegedly relating to care taking charges with respect to claimant. These bills purportedly are issued by some private agency which might be providing such care taking services to patients. Nothing in this regard is 11 pleaded in the petition. These bills are also relating to period from 1.6.2014 to 1.3.2015 major period of which relates to the time when this claimant himself remained in Hospital. Therefore, no private agency could have been providing him such alleged care taking services at that time. These bills patently are procured ones and hence the amount covered by these bills I.e Rs. 2 lacs cannot be awarded to claimant. Remaining amount Rs. 10,88,779/- is held liable to be paid jointly and severally by respondents to claimant. 17-As the disability certificate ExPW3/5 uncontrovertedly shows, and as is the unimpeached deposition of PW3 Dr. Dipesh Batra, the claimant has suffered 100% physical disability. He is now totally dependent upon others for all his work. The Medical certificate shows that it is vegetative life claimant now is leading. He is totally bed ridden and needs attendance round the clock. He is awarded Rs.1 lac as attendant charges. He also is given Rs.50,000/- for future medication. He is awarded Rs. 1,50,000/ - for suffering of pain and agony. He is also awarded Rs.10,000/- for transportation and Rs.20,000/- for special diet. He is also granted Rs. 1 lac on account of enjoyment of life and loss of amenities of life. 18-Both these issues accordingly are deciding in favour of claimant holding that respondents are jointly and severely liable to pay to him total compensation of Rs.19 ,38,779/-. ISSUE NO.3: 12 19-In view of my finding in issues No.1 and 2, where I concluded that claimant had suffered injuries due to rash and negligent driving of abovesaid Mini Bus by respondent No.1, this claim petition under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act is very much maintainable. This issue is accordingly decided against the respondents and in favour of claimant. ISSUES NO. 4 and 5 : 20- Onus to prove these issues was placed on respondent No.3 who had taken objections that the offending Bus and Offending Driver did not have valid transport documents/driving licence. Ld. Counsel for respondent No.3 has not touched these issues during course of arguments. All documents covered by these issues already were proved on file by respondents No.1 and 2 as Ex R2/A to Ex R2/J. These issues, therefore, are decided against respondent No.3 and in favour of claimant. ISSUE NO.6 (RELIEF): 21-In the sequel to my findings under aforesaid issues, this claim petition succeeds and the same is hereby allowed with costs. The total compensation amount of Rs.19,38,779/-is held liable to be paid by respondents no.1 to 3 jointly and severally to claimant. The claimant will be entitled to pendente lite and future interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum on the awarded amount, as per Judgment 'Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation Limited V. S.Raja Priya 2005(3) 13 A.C.J.1441' , from the date of filing of this petition till the date of actual realization of the amount. 22-Counsel fee is assessed at Rs.1100/-. Memo of costs be prepared. File be consigned to the Record Room. Pronounced in open Court. (Rajeev.K.Beri), Dated: 5.8.2016 Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ludhiana."

Claimant Versus 1.Girdhari Lal son of Shri Mool Chand, resident of Village Achali, Tehsil Nabha, District Patiala (Driver of Truck No.PB-11-BF-3218). 2.Jagsir Singh son of Shri Niranjan Singh, resident of Village Galwati, Tehsil Nabha, District Patiala (Owner of Truck No.PB-11-BF- 3218). 3.Bharti AXA General Insurance Co. Limited, Unit No.6 and 7, 3rd Floor, Kunal Tower, Mall Road, Ludhiana, through its Branch Manager (Insurance company of Truck No.PB-11-BF-3218). Respondents CLAIM PETITION UNDER SECTION 166 OF THE MOTOR VEHICLES ACT FOR GRANT OF COMPENSATION. Present:-Shri Suresh Kumar, Advocate, for claimant Shri J.K.Kapila, Advocate, for respondents No.1 and 2. Shri Vyom Bansal, Advocate, for respondent No.3. Jatinder Singh Vs. Girdhari Lal MACP/323/2015 - 10 - A W A R D Jatinder Singh aged about 45 years son of Shri Darshan Singh, resident of Village Jarg, Tehsil Payal, District Ludhiana, made application under section 166 of Motor Vehicles Act for grant of compensation to the tune of Rs. 15,00,000/- on account of injuries sustained to him in a road accident which occurred on 25.02.2015 at 11.30 P.M. due to rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1 while driving Truck No.PB-10BF-3218 near Metro Hotel, M.K. Road, Khanna. 2.Succinctly, the facts of this case are that on the ill fate day of 25.02.2015, the injured alongwith his mother Ranjit Kaur and one Paramjot Singh were coming from Khanna towards their house situated at Village Jarg, District Ludhiana, in Swift Car bearing No.HR-26-BR-3556 which was being driven by Paramjot Singh. At about 11.30 P.m., when they reached near Metro Hotel, Khanna, then the offending vehicle bearing No.PB-11BF-3218 was standing on the road against the traffic rules without blowing any indicator or traffic lights or reflectors, due to which the car struck against the offending vehicle from behind at driver side, due to which the injured, his mother Ranjit Kaur and said Paramjot Singh sustained multiple and grievous injuries. The injured suffered injuries on various parts of his body including face. The injured was taken to the Civil Hospital, Khanna from where the injured and his mother were referred to Amar Hospital, Patiala where he remained admitted w.e.f. 26.02.2015 to 13.03.2015. The accident was caused due to the sole Jatinder Singh Vs. Girdhari Lal MACP/323/2015 - 10 - negligence of the respondent No.1. Then FIR No. 59 dated 26.02.2015 was registered at Police Station City Khanna, District Ludhiana, under sections 279, 337, 338, 304-A, 427 IPC at the statement of Paramjot Singh. At the time of making statement to police, the name of driver was wrongly mentioned as Baljinder Singh son of Nikka Singh but later on after conducting enquiry, the correct name was revealed as Girdhari Lal and the police after conducting thorough investigation, presented challan against respondent No.1. Consequently, a prayer for awarding compensation to the tune of Rs. 15,00,000/- with costs has thus been made. 3.Upon notice, respondents No.1 and 2 appeared through their counsel and filed written statement in which it has been stated that claim petition is not maintainable as no accident took place. A false and frivolous FIR has been registered against respondent No.1. Moreover, respondent No.2 had employed respondent No.1 after checking his driving licence and taking his test. No alleged accident has ever taken place and as such, claimant is not entitled to any compensation from the answering respondents. It has been further denied that claimant suffered injuries. Remaining all other averments mentioned in the claim petition have been denied being incorrect and a prayer has been made for dismissal of the claim petition. 4.Respondent No.3 has also filed its separate written statement taking preliminary objections that claim petition is not maintainable because no accident has taken place with the Truck No.PB-10BF-3218; Jatinder Singh Vs. Girdhari Lal MACP/323/2015 - 10 - the driver of alleged offending vehicle Truck No.PB-10BF-3218 alleged to be involved in the alleged accident was not holding valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident and even respondent No.1 is not named in the FIR; the vehicle alleged to have been involved in the alleged accident was not having valid registration certificate, route permit and fitness certificate at the time of alleged accident and thus, respondent No.3 is not liable to pay any compensation. As the offending vehicle was plying in contravention of the terms of the policy of insurance company, therefore, respondent company has every right to contest the petition on all defenses which are available to the driver and owner of the vehicle. On merits, all the averments made in the claim petition have been denied being incorrect and prayer has been made for dismissal of the same. 5.Replication was not filed. From the pleadings of the parties the following issues were framed on 25.04.2016 :- 1)Whether claimant sustained injuries in an accident caused by rash and negligent driving of Truck bearing No.PB-10BF- 3218 being driven by the respondent No.1? OPP 2)Whether the claim petition is not maintainable form? OPR 3)Whether the respondent No.1 was not holding valid driving licence at the time of accident? OPR-3 4)Whether the offending vehicle was not having valid R.C., fitness certificate and valid permit at the time of accident? OPR-3 5)Whether the claimant is entitled to compensation? If so, to what extent and from whom? OPP 6)Relief. Jatinder Singh Vs. Girdhari Lal MACP/323/2015 - 10 - 6.In support of his claim petition, claimant himself stepped into the witness box as PW-1 and tendered his affidavit Ex.PA as per averments of the petition. He also proved on record cash memos Ex.P1 to Ex.P16 and PAN Card as Ex.P17. He further examined PW-2 Paramjot Singh who tendered his affidavit Ex.PB being eye witness of accident and on his statement, FIR was registered. Thereafter, learned counsel for claimant tendered into evidence certified copy of challan u/s.173 Cr.P.C. as Ex.P18, discharge summary of injured as Ex.P19, copy of the FIR as Mark-A and closed the evidence of claimant. 7.On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents No.1 and 2 tendered into evidence the copy of insurance policy as Ex.R1, copy of R.C. as Ex.R2, copy of certificate of fitness as Ex.R3, copy of permit as Ex.R4, copy of D.L. as Ex.R5 and closed evidence on behalf of respondents No.1 and 2. Learned counsel for respondent No.3 also closed its evidence without tendering any document or examining any witness. 8.I have heard both the learned counsel for the parties and have also gone through the record very carefully, with their able assistance. My issue wise findings are as under:- ISSUE NO.1 9.In order to prove this issue, claimant Jatinder Singh has stepped into the witness box as CW-1 and tendered his affidavit Ex.PA wherein he almost reiterated his version as set out in the petition itself. He further examined Paramjot Singh as CW-2 vide his affidavit Ex.PB. These witnesses were cross-examined at length, but nothing favourable could be Jatinder Singh Vs. Girdhari Lal MACP/323/2015 - 10 - elicited from their cross examination. There is not an iota of evidence on record, on the basis of which it can be said that he was in any way inimical towards the respondents. Concededly respondent No.1 was driving the offending vehicle at the time of the accident and a criminal case was registered against him. No doubt, respondents in their written statement denied the accident. However, claimant has placed on record the copy of challan under section 173 Cr.P.C. as Ex.P18 and copy of FIR as Mark-A which fully proves that respondent No.1 was very much involved in the alleged accident. Moreover, admittedly, respondents did not move any application before the higher authority regarding the false implication of respondent No.1 in a criminal case. Had he been innocent he was not supposed to sit folded hand and must have raised hue and cry regarding his false implication in the criminal case. As such, it is not expected from respondents to speak repugnant to their pleas taken in their reply. The criminal case has been registered against the respondent no.1 and copy of FIR Mark-A and report Ex.P18 has been placed on record, in which the name of the respondent No.1 as driver and the registration number of the Vehicle have been mentioned. As such, in the absence of any independent corroboration, no weight can be given to their averments made in the written statement. Moreover, in these circumstances, the respondent No.1 driver of the offending vehicle was most material witness to depose about this fact but he did not step into the witness box. As such, it is clear that on this ground alone, an adverse inference can be drawn against him as settled in Bhagwanti Devi Vs. Krishan Kumar Jatinder Singh Vs. Girdhari Lal MACP/323/2015 - 10 - Saini and others 1986 ACJ 331. On the other hand, the story put forth by the claimant stands established from the evidence, which has been referred to above. The contention raised by learned counsel for respondent No.3 that the name of respondent No.1 does not find mentioned in the FIR, is also found to be devoid of any merit as it is mentioned in the claim petition itself that earlier he mentioned the wrong name of driver but later on, he came to know about the correct name of driver as Girdhari Lal and challan was presented in court against respondent No.1 after conducting thorough investigation. Accordingly, conclusion is that respondent No.1 while driving Truck No.PB-10BF-3218 rashly and negligently caused the accident, resulting injuries to the claimant. Consequently, this issue is decided in favour of the claimant and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.5 10.While deciding issue No.1, this Tribunal has come to the conclusion that claimant received injuries in the motor vehicle accident due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle bearing registration No.PB-10BF-3218 being driven by respondent no.1. 11.Now the requisite question for determine arises as to whether the claimant is entitled to compensation, if so, to what extent and from which of the respondents. The claimant has come forward with the plea that he is entitled to recover a sum of Rs.15,00,000/- as compensation. He has further testified that after the accident, he was taken to the Civil Hospital, Khanna, District Ludhiana and then he was referred to Amar Hospital, Patiala. The claimant has further proved on record the medical Jatinder Singh Vs. Girdhari Lal MACP/323/2015 - 10 - bills from Ex.P1 to Ex.P16. The assertions of the claimant have been corroborated and supported by medical evidences which were placed on record in original. Thus there is no reason to disbelieve the testimony of the applicant which fully supported by documentary evidences regarding the medical bills. From the perusal of all these bills and receipts, it is found that the injured had spent an amount of Rs. 2,91,683/- and as such, he is held entitled to above said amount. Therefore, he must have suffered expenses towards special diet, transportations during the period of admission in the hospital. He must have been attended by someone. Due to the injuries, he also suffered pains and suffering, mental agony etc. Thus, without going into the minute details and keeping in view all the facts and circumstances into consideration it is found that the applicant is entitled to Rs. 30,000/- on guess work towards the special diet, transportations, attendance, pain and sufferings, mental agony etc. 12.Now compensation on account of loss of prospective income, amenities and general damages, the applicant remained admitted in the hospital from 26.02.2015 to 13.03.2015 due to the accident. As is well known, there can be no precise measure of compensation to be awarded in such cases. Determination of compensation by any mathematical calculation is not possible in the very nature of the things and in determination of the compensation arithmetic is not a good servant but a bad master. It is an accepted principle that while awarding compensation in an injury case, one should keep in mind that the amount awarded to the claimant is just. Pecuniary as well as non pecuniary loss suffered has to be Jatinder Singh Vs. Girdhari Lal MACP/323/2015 - 10 - taken in mind while calculating the compensation to be awarded. The amount awarded should be reasonable and fair. Now in the present case no contrary evidence has been led by the respondents to rebut the evidence led by the applicant. Thus, it stands established that the applicant has suffered injuries as has been pleaded by him. The applicant has also placed on file the medical record regarding his treatment. In view of this, it is duty of this Tribunal to make such an estimate about prospective earnings and probable loss. However, this Tribunal is of the view that one has to make an estimate based purely on guess work, as there are several uncertainties and imponderable involved as due to the injuries sustained the injured may burden of expenses to be incurred in future and his need of nursing and constant attendance and extra nourishment, if any have to be taken into account. The claimant has asserted his income as Rs.25,000/- per month by running the business of sale and purchase of cars and motor cycles and he suffered mental as well as economic loss. The counsel for respondent has contended that the injured has failed to prove that he was not able to do another work for rest of life. Therefore, no loss of income and employment has been suffered by the injured in the present case. 13.After hearing the respective contentions of both the sides and having gone through the oral as well as documentary evidences on record, this Tribunal is of the view that the total income of the applicant has not been proved on record and he has not able to prove that he is working as a shop keeper.

Patiala. ------Claimant. Versus. 1-P.R.T.C.,through its Managing Director, Nabha Road, Patiala ( Owner of Bus No. PB-10-V-2015 Temp./3922) 2-P.R.T.C., through its General Manager, Ludhiana Depot, Bus Stand, Ludhiana. 3-Charanjit Singh, driver of Bus No. PB-10-V- 2015 Temp/3922. ------Respondents. Claim Petition under Section 166 of The Motor Vehicles Act,1988. -00- Present:Shri Vyom Bansal, Advocate, for claimant. Shri Nand Lal, Advocate, for respondents no.1 to 3. AWARD This petition, under Section 166 of Motor Vehicles Act, has been filed by claimant seeking compensation from respondents no.1 to 3 on account of suffering of injuries by her in a motor vehicular accident on 8.6.2015. She averred in the petition that on that day it was about 2.00PM. She was travelling pillion on a motorcycle which was being driven by her husband Jinder @ Jinder Ram. He was driving that vehicle 2 at a slow speed and was on correct side of road. They were on the way from Patran to Samana. After crossing Bhawanigarh Chowk, when they reached near Petrol Pump Kenchian, a Bus bearing no. PB-10-V-2015 Temp./3922 came from behind. It was being driven rashly and negligently and at a very first speed by respondent no.3 resulting in its collision with abovesaid motorcycle throwing both of its occupants on the road. Claimant received multiple injuries. Her right arm was fractured. As the facts on record are claimant firstly was taken to Civil Hospital, Samana, then to Rajindra Hospital, Patiala and ultimately was referred for treatment at PGI, Chandigarh on same day. She was admitted there and was operated thrice and ultimately was discharged from there on 13.7.2015. She is just 30 years old and is a Housemaker and domestic services provided by her to the family are of value about Rs. 12,000/- per month. She spent about Rs. 2 lacs on her medical treatment, besides suffering of mental agony and pain, expenditure on special diet, transportation, loss of earning, loss of earning capacity, loss of future prospects and enjoyment of life etc. She still is receiving treatment. The respondents No.1 and 2 are owners of Bus while respondents No.3 was driver of offending vehicle. Hence this petition whereby she has sought Rs. 30 lacs with interest from respondents. 2Upon notice all three respondents appeared and filed their joint written statement raising preliminary objections that this petition is not maintainable as the parties had already effected compromise, recorded in daily diary dated 11.6.2015/12.6.2015 of P.S. Samana, whereby the 3 claimant had received Rs. 40,000/- through her husband and had undertaken not to initiate any legal process against respondents. Respondents also added that the petition is bad for non-joinder of necessary parties. While replying on merits, they admitted that referred Bus now bearing permanent registration no. PB-10-FF-1521 is owned by respondents no.1 and 2 and was driven by respondent no.3 on 8.6.2015 at the referred time and place. They also admitted taking place of collision of motorcycle of claimant party with said bus at that place but denied if it was resulted by rash or negligent driving of referred bus by respondent no.3. As per him the Bus was new one and he bringing it from the Bus Body Fabricator, Rajasthan to P.R.T.C Head Office, Patiala and there was none else in the bus. The referred place of crossing was a very busy area and, therefore, he was driving it very slowly. A motorcyclist with claimant as pillion rider came from the side of Petrol Pump on the left hand of road and suddenly turned the vehicle to the right side to join the traffic on the main road towards Samana. Respondent no.3 blew horn of Bus and also turned the Bus more to his right to avoid collision. The motorcycle was at a high speed and, therefore, it hit into the front left indicator of the Bus. Claimant was injured and, on insistence of respectables, respondent no.3 paid abovesaid Rs. 40,000/- to her through her husband to help them financially despite the fact that respondent no.3 was innocent. Respondents denied remaining version of petition and ultimately sought its dismissal. 3-No rejoinder was filed by the claimant. 4 4-From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed on 27.1.2016:- 1-Whether claimant Sukhi Rani @ Sukhi wife of Sh. Jinder @ Jinder Ram( was ) injured in a Motor Vehicle Accident caused by respondent no.3 while driving Bus bearing No. PB-10V-2015(T)/3922 on 8.6.2015 rashly and negligently? OPP 2-Whether the claimant is entitled for compensation on account of injury sustained by her,if so to what extent? OPA 3-Whether the present petition is maintainable ? OPP 4-Whether the respondent No.3 was not holding valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident?OPR 5-Whether the claim petition is bad for mis-joinder and non- joinder of necessary party?OPR 6-Relief. 5-To prove her version, claimant testified as PW1 and also examined Dr. Parveen Puri as PW2 and closed her evidence. 6-In response to it, respondent no.3 Charanjit Singh ( driver of offending Bus) deposed as RW1. Respondents also examined driver Malkit Singh as RW2 and closed their evidence. No evidence in rebuttal was led by claimant. 7-I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record . My issue-wise findings are as under:- 5 Issues No.1 and 2. 8-Both these issues are interconnected, and, therefore, are being taken up together for disposal to avoid repetition of discussion. 9-To prove these issues, claimant herself firstly stepped into the witness box and deposed as PW1. In her examination-in-chief, she reiterated the entire version of petition verbatim where she detailed out as to how the ill-fated occurrence under reference took place at about 2.00 PM on 8.6.2015 near Bhawanigargh Chowk in the area of P.S. Samana wherein, as per her, the rashly driven Bus No. PB-10V-2015(T)/3922 by respondent No.3 collided with the motorcycle of complainant party resulting in serious injuries on the person of complainant. She also deposed on oath that her right arm was also fractured. She firstly was taken to Civil Hospital, Samana, then to Rajindra Hospital, Patiala and then on the same day she was admitted in PGI, Chandigarh where she remained hospitalized till 13.7.2015 during which period she was operated upon thrice. Plastic surgery was also done on her wound. Thereafter also she went there for follow-up treatment. Copy of her admission/discharge certificate is Ex P1. She also proved medicines bills Ex P2 to ExP33 along with dressing/surgery medicine bills Ex P34 to Ex P77 regarding her follow-up treatment, and transportation bills Ex P78 to Ex P81. 10-Cross-examination of PW1 claimant more or less is suggestive only where though the fact of taking place of involved occurrence remained undisputed. In the written statement itself, the 6 respondents No.1 to 3 have admitted that such collision of above stated Bus and motorcycle had taken place. Their version is that it occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the said motorcycle by claimant party. However, suggestions regarding it were controverted by claimant PW1 in her cross-examination. She also denied if parties had effected compromise soon after the occurrence whereby she was given Rs. 40,000/- by the driver/respondent No.3 as full and final settlement of the case or that he was innocent. 11-To rebut this evidence, respondent no.3 Charanjit Singh deposed as RW1. In examination-in chief he admitted that he was the driver of referred bus no. PB-10V-2015(T)/3922 now having registration no. PB-10-FF-1521 on 8.6.2015. He reiterated the version of written statement that he was driving it slowly and carefully but it was due to rash driving of involved motorcycle by the claimant party that the collision of involved vehicles took place resulting in injuries to claimant. He also reiterated that, therefore, the matter was compromised just to extend financial help to injured claimant. The compromise took place in presence of husband and father of claimant and DDR copy thereof is EX RW1/1. Cross-examination of this witness is concise and suggestive only where though claimant party unsuccessfully suggested to him that a thumb impression of Jinder Ram( husband of claimant ) was taken out on blank paper and subsequently was converted into a compromise to help the respondent party. The deposition of RW1 Malkit Singh, another driver 7 with respondents No.1 and 2 working as Incharage at Bus Stand Patran, is on same lines as of RW1. 12-It is an admitted factum in the pleadings of both the parties that collision of motorcycle of claimant party and the abovesaid Bus had taken place near Bhawanigarh Chowk at about 2.00 PM on 8.6.2015 wherein claimant had received multiple injuries on her body. The statement of claimant PW1 patently has gone unimpeached to the effect that this occurrence was resulted due to rash and negligent driving of abovesaid bus by respondent no.3 i.e RW1, especially, when except for oral denials, there is no positive evidence on the part of respondents on record. The respondents are heavily relying upon compromise EX RW1/1 which also nowhere states that respondent No.3 was not responsible for causing of involved accident. It merely states that parties had effected a compromise and the claimant party did not intend to take any legal action against respondent party. It is other matter that claimant has denied taking place of such compromise also. Otherwise also, as is held by Hon'ble High Court in judgments, relied upon by claimant, Bansi and another Vs. Vikas, FAO No.7213 of 2010 decided on 29.8.2012 and Smt. Sadhna Nagpal and Ors vs. Life Insurance Corporation of India and another, FAO No.3863 of 2008 decided on 1.6.2011 , this DDR entry EX RW1/1 cannot play as an estoppal against claimant who has deposed on oath before the court as PW1 attributing negligence in driving of abovesaid Bus to respondent No.3. His negligence is manifest in the circumstances involved in this case when the place of occurrence was 8 near Bhawanigargh Chowk, a rushy area even as per respondent no.3 himself, and he was driving a heavy vehicle. He was without even a Conductor in the bus, as his pleadings show. He failed to realize the traffic flowing along the left side of Bus, thereby patently suggesting that he was negligent in driving that Bus for which reason the involved collision took place. It is not disputed by respondents No.1 to 3 that this Bus was owned by respondents No.1 and 2 on which respondent No.3 was the driver on the fateful day. Therefore, it is held that all three respondents are jointly and severely liable to answer the claim of claimant in this petition. 13-It is in petition and also in the deposition of claimant PW1 that she is a housemaker. Her opening line of cross-examination is in present tense. Basing his argument on it learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondents vehemently argued that claimant still was working and had not suffered any disability or loss of income. Fact remains that at the fag end of her cross-examination she categorically stated that earlier she was working as a domestic help in two houses but she now no more is working because she is unable to move her hand properly. It is a fact of common knowledge that a lady of the house does multifarious jobs in the family. The domestic work she performs cannot be equated with that of a maid. Whatever physical mental work she does for herself and family, though cannot precisely be measured in terms of money but definitely it has to be higher than what a maid would earn. Her monthly income, therefore, is taken as Rs. 5,000/-. 9 14-Claimant has examined PW2 Dr. Parveen Puri. In his examination-in-chief he proved disability certificate of claimant as PW2/A while specifically stating that she was examined by Medical Board of which he himself also was a member. It was an old case of injury on her right elbow and forearm. The injury had led to fixed flexion deformity of right elbow. She was having flail hand. This disability was assessed as 50% and was permanent in nature. Cross- examination of this witness is formal and suggestive where nothing shattering the outcome of such medical diagnosis of 50% permanent disability could be brought up by respondents. The claimant is a house- maker. Without a working right hand,which rather was permanently disabled to an extent that it was a dangling hand, and, therefore, the working capacity of claimant has lessened by 50%. The loss of earning for her, therefore, comes to Rs. 2500/- per month which annually becomes Rs. 30,000/-. As per petition, claimant is 30 years of age but as per disability certificate EXPW2/A she is 28 years of age. By virtue of Judgment 'Smt.Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Anr. 2009 (3) Recent Civil Reports 77' , multiplier of 17 is to be applied to the said range of age of injured claimant. Total compensation on this count , therefore, comes to Rs. 5,10,000/-. 15-In addition to abovesaid amount of Rs. 5,10,000/- the claimant is also entitled to cost of medication, dressing, surgery etc.. She spent an amount of Rs. 69,592/- vide bills EX P2 to Ex P77. The 10 argument of Ld. Counsel for respondents that these bills cannot be relied upon when claimant was to receive only open dressing but she went for surgery etc vide bills like Ex P60 and Ex P63 seems inconsequential when all medical treatment including dressing and surgery for application of medicine must had been followed keeping in view the condition of injuries on the person of complainant. The Doctor was the best person to act in the circumstances and to execute surgery or dressing etc as per medical wisdom. It is also not disputed that the claimant is resident of Patran, District Patiala and was operated upon at PGI, Chandigarh. She remained hospitalized there for about 35 days. As per document Ex P1, she was discharged from there on 13.7.2015 where she again went on 20.7.2015. She must had spent on transportation in this regard. She has placed on record transportation bills Ex P78 to Ex P81 total worth Rs. 11,000/-. Submission is made by Ld. Counsel for respondents that as per discharge card EX P1 the claimant had visited PGI, Chandigarh for follow-up treatment on 20.7.2015 but she has furnished bill Ex P80 worth Rs.3,000/- relating to 21.7.2015 which, therefore,is procured one. Ld. Counsel for claimant has failed to justify this discrepancy while half heartedly arguing that the bill might have been obtained from Transporter on the next day. I find this reply not convincing one as the bill had to be of the date of visit only. The transportation expenditure borne by claimant, therefore, comes down to Rs.8,000/- in the absence of bill EX P80 which is held payable to claimant. 11 16-In addition to this amount,the claimant is held entitled to Rs. 5,000/- for loss of her income during the period she remained hospitalized. This period is of about 35 days. 17-The claimant has become 50% permanently disabled from her right arm. She would require continuous attendance of a family member for her day to day work. She is granted Rs.10,000/- on this account. She also is granted Rs. 20,000/- for future treatment and special diet. In addition to this, she also is granted Rs. 30,000/- on account of suffering of mental agony and pain. Total compensation amount hence comes to Rs.6,52,542/-( Rs, 5,10,000 + Rs. 69,592 + Rs. 8,000 + Rs. 5,000/- +Rs.10,000 + Rs.20,000 + Rs. 30,000 ) payable to claimant by respondents No.1 to 3 jointly and severely. 18-Resultantly, both these issues accordingly are decided in favour of claimant and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.3 19-In view of my finding on issues no.1 and 2, this petition for compensation on behalf of claimant is maintainable. This issue is decided in her favour and against the respondents. ISSUES NO.4 and 5: 20-Onus to prove these issues was upon the appearing respondents. They did not lead any evidence in this regard. Resultantly, and in view of my findings under issues No.1 and 2, these issues are decided against respondents and in favour of claimant. ISSUE NO.6 (RELIEF) 12 21-In the sequel to my findings under aforesaid issues, this claim petition succeeds and the same is hereby allowed with costs. The total compensation amount of Rs.6,52,542/-is held liable to be paid by the respondents no.1 to 3 jointly and severally to claimant. The claimant will be entitled to pendente lite and future interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum on the awarded amount, as per Judgment 'Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation Limited V. S.Raja Priya 2005(3) A.C.J.1441' , from the date of filing of this petition till the date of actual realization of the amount. 22-Counsel fee is assessed at Rs.1100/-. Memo of costs be prepared. File be consigned to the Record Room. Pronounced in open Court. (Rajeev.K.Beri) Dated: 18-07-2016. Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ludhiana."

Shri Vyom Bansal,Advocate, counsel for respondent no.3 AWARD 2 This petition, under Section 166 of Motor Vehicles Act, has been filed by claimant seeking compensation from respondents no.1 to 3 on account of suffering of injuries by him in a motor vehicular accident on 11.2.2015 caused by respondent No.1 by driving Car No. PB-10-DN- 0615 in a rash and negligent near Village Noorpura. Claimant averred that he is just 28 years old and was working as Marketing Developer in Sales Department with M/s Ludhiana Beverages Private Ltd.,185, G.T.Road, Ludhiana and was earning Rs. 15,000/- per month from all sources like salary, allowances and other perks. On 11.2.2015 it was about 8.30 PM. He was driving a Bajaj Platina motorcycle. His friends had accompanied him. They were on the way through Village Noorpura to Sudhar, Distt. Ludhiana. They were short of Village Noorpura. Abovesaid car came from opposite side which was being driven by respondent No.1 in a rash and negligent manner. It hit into the motorcycle of claimant resulting in multiple grievous injuries on his body. He has become permanently disabled. Prior to it he was in good state of health and perfect physique. He could attend his all activities by himself. Due to suffering of incapacitation, he now cannot attend his daily work. He also has suffered great mental shock,pain and agony besides suffering of disfigurement on his body. He also has been prescribed special diet. He had suffered loss of marriage prospects and enjoyment of life. He is now totally dependent upon others and has kept a regular attendant and professional to attend to his needs. He has spent over Rs. 5 lacs on his medical treatment which still is continuing. For such treatment he was admitted in Life Care 3 Hospital at Raikot and then in new DMC & H, Ludhiana and was operated upon as well since his leg was fractured at different places and rod and plate had to be inserted in it. Offending car is owned by respondent No.2 and was insured with respondent No.3. FIR No.19 dated 15.2.2015 under sections279,337,338,427 IPC was registered regarding this occurrence. Hence this petition whereby claimant sought Rs. 25 lacs as compensation with interest from respondents. 3-On notice,all three respondents appeared. Respondents No.1 and 2 filed their joint written statement wherein they controverted the maintainability of this petition and if claimant has a cause of action to file it. While replying on merits, they admitted that the abovesaid car is owned by respondent No.2 and was duly insured with respondent No.3 on the date of alleged occurrence. They also admitted lodging of abovesaid FIR against respondent No.1 while adding that he was falsely implicated. They denied remaining version of petition and sought its dismissal. 4-In its written statement, respondent No.3 also denied the version in petition and sought its dismissal while adding that it is bad for mis-joinder and non-joinder of necessary parties like the owner and insurer of abovesaid Bajaj Platina motorcycle. 5-No rejoinder was filed by claimant. 6-On such pleadings, following issues were framed on 15.3.2016: 1.Whether claimant Deepak Bhalla son of Sh. Gian Chand Bhalla suffered injury in a Motor Vehicle Accident caused by respondent no.1 while driving the 4 offending vehicle bearing No. PB-10DN-0615 rashly and negligently on 11.2.2015?OPP 2.Whether the claimant is entitled for compensation on account of injury sustained by him,if so to what extent? OPP 3.Whether the present petition is maintainable?OPP 4.Whether the present petition is filed without any cause of action?OPR 5.Whether the claim petition is bad for mis-joinder and non-joinder of necessary party?OPR 6.Whether respondent No.1 was not holding valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident?OPR(3) 7.Relief. 7-To prove his version claimant firstly himself deposed as PW1, then examined Sanjeev Singh, Clerk-cum-Computer Operator from DMC & H, Ludhiana as PW2, Dr. Gurpreet Singh Goyal from said Hospital as PW3, tendered EX PA Statement of account, issued by State Bank of Patiala, and closed his evidence. 8-Respondents No.1 and 2 suffered closure of their evidence by order of the Court when they did not lead any oral or documentary evidence despite due opportunities. Subsequent to it they moved application to lead such evidence for allowing of which the claimant did not raise any objection. On his statement in this regard, respondents No.1 and 2 again were granted opportunity but still they did not lead any evidence and suffered its closure by order of the Court. 5 9-Respondent No.3 tendered verification report of medical bills of claimant as EX R3/A with copy of insurance policy of abovesaid car as EX R3/B and closed its evidence. 10-Claimant then tendered documents EX PW1/221 to EX PW1/231 and copy of FIR ExPW1/231 in rebuttal evidence remaining of which ultimately was closed by order of the court. 11-I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record . My issue-wise findings are as under:- Issues No.1 and 2. 12-Both these issues are interconnected, and, therefore, are being taken up together for disposal to avoid repetition of discussion. 13-To prove these issues, claimant himself stepped into witness box and deposed as PW1. In examination-in-chief he reiterated the entire version of his petition verbatim. During this course, he duly explained as to how the ill-fated occurrence took place at about 8.30 PM on 11.2.2015 near Village Noorpura while he was on Bajaj Platina Motorcycle with his friends and a car No. PB-10-DN-0615 came from opposite side which was being driven by respondent No.1 in a rash and negligent manner and it hit into the motorcycle of claimant resulting in multiple grievous injuries on the person of the latter rendering him permanently disabled. He got lodged FIR No.19 dated 15.2.2015 with PS Raikot, a copy of which he proved on file as EX PW1/231. His cross-examination on the point is merely suggestive. There he also stated that he has a valid driving licence with him and the road, at the place of occurrence, also is 6 about 10-12 feet wide and there was not much traffic there at that time. He denied if he himself was rash and negligent in driving the motorcycle. Nothing more regarding this occurrence was put to him by the respondents. The alleged offending driver i.e respondent No.1, or, for that matter, respondent No.2 being owner of involved car also did not bother to step into the witness box thereby they conceding the correctness of claimant's version which has gone unrebutted. By virtue of these circumstances the claimant has been able to prove the issue No.1 that it was respondent No.1 who had driven the referred car in a rash and negligent manner at the above said time and place and thereby had caused the involved accident of the car he was driving and motorcycle of the claimant resulting in injuries to the latter. 14-Regarding the quantum of compensation, the claimant, besides himself deposing as PW1, also has examined Sanjeev Singh, Clerk-Cum-Computer Operator from DMC & H, Ludhiana as PW2 and Dr. Gurpreet Singh Goyal from said Hospital as PW3. In his own statement as PW1 claimant stated that due to abovesaid occurrence he firstly was removed to Life Care Hospital at Raikot and then to DMC & H, Ludhiana on the next day. He was operated upon a number of times and still is under treatment. He has spent over Rs. 10 lacs on such treatment which still is continuing. He proved on file medical bills in this regard as EX PW1/1 to EXPW1/215. He also brought on file photographs EX PW1/216 to EX PW1/218 reflecting the condition of his leg injury. 7 15-PW2 Clerk Sanjeev Singh, from DMC & H, Ludhiana also supported such statement of PW1 claimant by stating that the latter remained admitted with said Hospital from 12.2.2015 to 28.2.2015, then from 14.4.2015 till 18.4.2015, again from 30.8.2015 to 5.9.2015. He also remained admitted in that Hospital on 11.9.2015 also and was discharged on the same day after operation. He was re-admitted from 18.2.2016 till 20.2.2016 and again from 26.6.2016 till 2.7.2016 and his medical bills relating to said DMC & H, Ludhiana are EX PW2/1 to EX PW2/71. His cross-examination, like that of PW1 claimant, is formal and suggestive. 16-PW3 Dr. Gurpreet Singh Goyal from abovesaid Hospital also supported the version of claimant that latter was admitted in that Hospital on 12.2.2015 due to accidental injuries. He was found having fractured right femur and proximal right tibia. He was operated upon on 13.2.2015 and again was operated upon on 20.2.2015. His skin grafting on right leg wound also was done before he was discharged on 28.2.2015. During such treatment course he was again admitted on 30.8.2015 for infected metal work over proximal tibia and for non-united rod of tibia fracture etc. He was again admitted for knee casting on 11.9.2015. He again was operated upon for non-healing ulcer over proximal leg right side on 18.2.2016. Cross-examination of this witness also is formal in nature. No evidence in rebuttal is brought on file by respondents. The unrebutted testimonies of PW1 to PW3 and medical bills Ex PW1/1 to ExPW1/220 with bills EX PW2/1 to ExPW2/71 show that claimant had suffered serious injuries. His right leg had suffered multiple fractures. He was 8 operated upon a number of times in DMC & H, Ludhiana in this regard. He suffered a lot of pain and suffering which statedly still is continuing. Unrebutted photographs EX PW1/216 to EXPW1/218 also show that the wound on the right leg of claimant is far from having healed. Even the statement of PW3 Doctor shows that this patient/claimant had to be admitted and re-admitted time and again in the Hospital for cure of complications arisen in his treatment. However, perusal of medical bills placed and proved on file by claimant shows that bills like EX PW1/98 (EX PW2/3), EX PW1/101 (EX PW2/4), EX PW1/102 (EX PW2/6), EX PW1/120( EX PW2/43) etc and many others are repetitive in nature. Besides this, many others bills like EX PW1/101, EX PW1/104, EX PW1/114, EX PW1/125, EX PW1/126, EX P128, EX PW1/138, EX PW1/178 etc are regarding advance payments which stood adjusted in the subsequent bills. In the circumstances the claimant, therefore, is entitled to reimbursement of medical expenses which come to Rs. 4,09,652/- as is admitted by respondent- insurance company vide document EX R3/A. Though, claimant has asserted that he has suffered permanent disability but no medical evidence in this regard is on file. 17-Claimant has also averred in the petition that he has been working with M/s Ludhiana Beverages Private Ltd, Ludhiana as Marketing Developer in Sales Department and was earning Rs. 15,000/- per month from said salary, allowances and other perks. He has not examined any authorized person/official from said alleged employer but has simply tendered a copy of his offer of appointment dated 8.5.2014 as 9 EX PW1/219 with a copy of pay slip relating to January, 2015 as EX PW1/220. These unrebutted documents patently show that this claimant has been working with said employer on monthly salary of about Rs.8,000/-. There is no further proof on file which could show that in addition to this income, the claimant had ever obtained any other Perks and Allowances. There also is no proof that due to suffering of abovesaid injuries he has been rendered unfit to continue with job or to have suffered even partial disability affecting his such capacity to earn. Nobody from the side of his employer has stepped into witness box to show suffering of any disability in this regard by the claimant or his non- continuation in the abovesaid job as Marketing Developer. In the circumstances, the claimant cannot be held to have suffered any incapacity to earn, except for the period of his hospitalization which is of about 40 days. Claimant is entitled to Rs. 11,000/- on this account. In addition to it, claimant is also entitled to compensation of Rs.40,000/- for continuous suffering of pain and agony. He also is awarded Rs. 10,000/- for special diet. He also is found entitled to compensation of Rs.50,000/- on account of future treatment and Rs.50,000-/- on account of loss of marriage prospects and amenities of life. He also is granted Rs. 25,000/- on account of physical disfigurement and Rs. 5,000/- as transportation charges. 18-In view of admissions of respondents No.1 and 2 in their written statement about the ownership of abovesaid offending car No.PB- 10-DN-0615 in the name of respondent No.2 and its insurance with 10 respondent No.3 on the day of occurrence, liability of all three respondents becomes joint and several for clearance of abovesaid amount in favour of claimant. 19-Resultantly, these issues No.1 and 2 are decided in favour of claimant and against the respondents who are held liable, jointly and severely, to pay Rs.6,00,652/- to claimant. ISSUES NO.3 AND 4: 20-In the light of my findings under issues No.1 and 2, this claim petition is found maintainable and petitioner had a cause of action to file the petition due to receipt of injuries in abovesaid Motor Vehicular Accident. These issues are decided in favour of claimant and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.5: 21- No evidence in this regard has been brought on file by any of the respondents.

He has suffered multiple and grievous injuries on his head, face, left portion of his body, his jaw bones were dislocated and flesh of face was ruptured besides other injuries on his body and remained admitted in DMC, Ludhiana from 28.1.2013 to 13.2.2013. 3.It has been averred that on 28.1.2013, injured Surinder Kumar Bansal was coming from Sirsa to Sidhwan Bet by occupying Car No.PB- 10-AE-2709 being driven by his son Vishal Bansal. His wife Smt.Kamlesh Bansal, his son Gaurav Bansal and another person Bhinder Singh were also travelling by the said car. He was driving the car on his left hand side of the road at normal speed. At about 11 A.M., when they reached near Power House Sidhwan Bet on Ludhiana to Jagraon Road, in the meantime a truck bearing N o.RJ-31-GA-0017 being driven by the respondent No.2 in a rash and negligent manner, came from opposite side. On seeing such driving, Vishal Bansal took his car on the extreme left edge of the road on 'kacha' birm. Even the truck bearing No.RJ-31-GA- 0017 hit the car No.PB-10-AE-2709 by going on the extreme wrong side on “kacha” birm. As a result, all occupants of the car suffered grievous Page: 3 Surinder Kumar Bansal vs. Boota Singh etc. MACT No.67 of 13.4.2015 and multiple injuries. They were taken to DMC Ludhiana from the spot where Kamlesh Rani and Vishal Bansal died on account of injuries suffered in this accident.

He remained admitted at DMC, Ludhiana from 28.1.2013 to 13.2.2013. A sum of Rs.5,00,000/- was spent on his treatment, transportation, medicines etc and a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- is prospected to be spent on his future treatment. The accident took place on account of sole rash and negligent driving of truck bearing No.RJ-31- GA-0017 by the respondent No.2 Udham Singh. It is claimed that all the respondents are liable to pay the compensation amount of Rs.50,00,000/- (fifty lacs). 4.Consequent upon notice of the claim petition, the respondents no.1 and 2 did not appear despite notice and they were proceeded against ex parte. 5.The respondent No.3 filed written statement taking the preliminary objections that the claim petition is liable to be dismissed as there is no reason explained for delay in lodging the FIR; the claim petition is not maintainable as no accident has ever taken place as alleged in the claim petition; the answering respondents are not liable to pay any compensation since respondent No.2 i.e. driver of the offending vehicle was not possessing valid and effective driving licence, R.C, fitness certificate; the Car No.PB-10-AE-2709 did not have the valid registration Page: 4 Surinder Kumar Bansal vs. Boota Singh etc. MACT No.67 of 13.4.2015 certificate and fitness certificate at the time of alleged accident and the same was being driven against the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act; the answering respondent takes all the defences available to insurance company under Sections 147, 149, 157, 158(6) and 170 of the Motor Vehicle Act and reserves its right to amend the written statement on the disclosure of new facts and that the present claim petition is not maintainable unless and until the claimant confirms that no other petition has been filed arising out of the same accident either before this Court or any other MACT Court within the country. On merits, the mode and manner of the accident has been denied. It has been denied that the injured was earning Rs.20,000/- per month. It is denied that truck bearing No.RJ-31-GA-0017 was involved in the accident. It is denied that future of the claimant is ruined on account of injuries suffered in the accident. It is denied that accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the truck bearing No.RJ-31-GA-0017 by the respondent No.2. It is denied that an amount of Rs.5 lacs was spent on the treatment of the claimant and Rs.10 lacs is prospected to be sent. While denying all other averments and while reiterating the averments of the preliminary objections, it has ultimately been prayed that the claim petition may be dismissed. 6.On the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed and recorded: “1. Whether the Claimant suffered injuries and permanent disability in road side accident on 28.1.2013 due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing registration No.RJ-31-GA-0017 being driven by respondent No.2? OPP. Page: 5 Surinder Kumar Bansal vs. Boota Singh etc. MACT No.67 of 13.4.2015 2. Whether the claimant is entitled to compensation? If so, to what amount?OPP. 3. Whether the claim petition is not maintainable? OPR. 4. Relief.” 7.Claimant Surinder Kumar Bansal himself appeared as PW-1. During his deposition, he also also tendered documents. The Counsel for claimant tendered into evidence documents Mark-A and Mark-B and closed the evidence. The learned Counsel for respondent No.3 tendered into evidence documents Mark-R1, Mark-RA and Mark-RB. The evidence of he respondent No.3 was closed by its Counsel thereafter. No rebuttal was led by the claimant. 8.I have heard Sh.Uma Shanker Adv.,Counsel for the claimant and Sh.A.K.Shori, Adv.,Counsel for the respondent No.3 and have gone through the record with their able assistance. My issuewise findings are as under: Issues No.1 and 2: 9.Being interconnected and interlinked, both these issues are taken up together for discussion. 10.The learned Counsel for the claimant has contended that in the accident which took place because of rash and negligent driving of the offending truck by Udham Singh respondent No.2, the claimant suffered grievous injuries. He remained admitted in the hospital from 28.1.2013 to 13.2.2013. He also suffered pain and agony and suffered loss of income, therefore the compensation sought for may be granted. Page: 6 Surinder Kumar Bansal vs. Boota Singh etc. MACT No.67 of 13.4.2015 11.The learned Counsel for the respondent No.3 contended that neither the proof of income nor the permanent disability has been proved by the claimant. He is not entitled to the compensation under the said heads. However, the case summary has been produced by the Counsel for the claimant wherein amount of Rs.4,19,427/- has been admitted to be correct by the Counsel for the respondent No.3. 12.Claimant Surinder Kumar Bansal when appeared as his own witness as PW1, has deposed by way of his Affidavit Ex.PW1/A whereby he has reiterated and reasserted his entire pleaded case which for the sake of brevity and to avoid repetition, may be omitted to be mentioned here again. 14.Nothing worthwhile supporting the case of the respondent No.3 whereby the respondent No.3 has pleaded that no accident has taken place; has appeared in the cross-examination of the claimant as mentioned here in above. Copy of FIR is Ex.P1. It was recorded at the instance of Surinder Kumar Bansal, who by his depositions while appearing as PW-1, has corroborated the version of the FIR. The Counsel for claimant has also tendered into evidence copy of the MACT Award dated 16.12.2014 regarding the same motor vehicle accident caused by the truck No.RJ-31- GA-0017 owned by Boota Singh and driven by Udham Singh is driver. When once it has been held by the MACT that accident took place because of the rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by Udham Singh respondent who is also respondent No.2 in the present claim petition, the cause of the claimant that accident took place because Page: 7 Surinder Kumar Bansal vs. Boota Singh etc. MACT No.67 of 13.4.2015 of rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by Udham Singh respondent No.2 which truck is owned by Boota Singh respondent No.1; stands proved from the copy of Award dated 16.12.2014 Mark-A on record. The driver of the vehicle respondent No.2 was the best person who could reveal the truth of the accident but he was not examined by the respondents. He could not dare to come into witness box and deny the accident. The adverse inference is thus required to be drawn against him. Where the FIR is registered against the driver of offending vehicle, it is prima facie proof that vehicle was being driven rashly and negligently. For both these above said principles of law, I am fortified with the pronouncements “Sheela Devi and others Versus Jayati Parshad and others, II (1995) ACC 240” as well as “National Insurance Company Limited Versus Sanjay Kumar & Ors., Vol.II (2011) ACC 75” of the Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court. The claimant has thus proved on record that accident took place because of rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by the respondent No.2 wherein the claimant suffered injuries. 15.It is thus held that claimant Surinder Kumar Bansal suffered injuries in a motor vehicle accident which took place because of rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by its driver Udham Singh respondent No.2 which truck is owned by Boota Singh respondent No.1. 16.In order to get compensation, the claimant has relied upon the Discharge Summary Ex.P2, bills Ex.P3 to Ex.P74 regarding purchase of medicines and diagnosis etc showing the payments. Although the Page: 8 Surinder Kumar Bansal vs. Boota Singh etc. MACT No.67 of 13.4.2015 claimant has sought compensation on account of permanent disability but no Disability Certificate has been produced on record nor any doctor from the Board of Doctors has been examined to prove the extent of disability. Therefore, no compensation for the said disability can be granted. I find support on this score from the pronouncements reported as “Lakhvinder Singh Versus Wazir Singh and others, 2001 AIHC 3569 (DB)” of the Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court and “Nemi Chand Veruss Mahendra Kumar, 2012(2) W.L.N.39” of the Hon'ble Rajasthan High Court. 17.The accident took place on 28.1.2013. As per the Policy Mark-R1, the insurance cover was valid till midnight of 1.5.2013. The accident took place withing the validity period of the insurance policy. The amount of compensation if recovered or paid by th respondents No.1 and 2, is thus liable to be reimbursed by the respondent No.3 being insurance company. Therefore, liability to pay the compensation, of the respondents, is joint and several. 18.The claimant also relied upon Discharge Summary Ex.P2 showing that he remained admitted in Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana with effect from 28.1.2013 to 13.2.2013. He obviously suffered pain and agony and remained absent from his occupation and could not earn for some period. He obviously also required the services of attendant and special diet etc. The amount claimed by the claimant as per the dates of bills relied upon by the claimant in detail, the bills themselves and the case summary, which has been found correct by the other side, the Page: 9 Surinder Kumar Bansal vs. Boota Singh etc. MACT No.67 of 13.4.2015 claimant is entitled to the compensation amount of Rs.4,19,427/- spent by him on his treatment, diagnoses and other articles. He is also entitled to the sum of Rs.50,000/- towards pain and suffering, attendant charges, special diet etc. The claimant is thus entitled to recover the total compensation amount of .4,19,427/- + 50,000/- = ₹ ₹ 4,69,427/- (Four₹ lacs, Sixty Nine thousand, four hundred and twenty seven rupees) from the respondents. The liability of the respondents to pay the said amount of compensation is joint and several. Both these issues are thus decided in favour of the claimant. Issue No.3: 19.The onus of this issue was on the respondents. In view of the findings returned on the issues No.1 and 2, the Court is of the opinion that the claim petition filed by the claimant seeking compensation on account of injuries suffered by him in a motor vehicle accident is duly maintainable in the present form and the respondents have failed to prove as to how the petition is not maintainable. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the claimant and against the respondents. Relief 20.As a result of the above findings on the above issues, the claim petition is allowed against the respondents No.1 and 2 ex parte and is allowed against the respondent No.3. The Award is thus passed for the recovery of 4,69,427/- (Four lacs, Sixty Nine thousand, four₹ hundred and twenty seven rupees) against the respondents No.1 and 2 Page: 10 Surinder Kumar Bansal vs. Boota Singh etc. MACT No.67 of 13.4.2015 ex-parte and against he respondent No.3. The liability of the respondents No.1 to 3 to make the payment of compensation amount shall be joint and several. The respondents No.1 to 3 are directed to pay the aforesaid amount to the claimant within two months from today, failing which the claimant shall also be entitled to get the interest @ 9% P.A from the date of institution of the present claim petition till the realisation of the compensation amount.

SPS Kanda, Adv., Counsel for Claimants. Sh. G.S. Gill, Adv., Counsel for Respondents No. 1 & 2 Sh. Rajiv Abhi, Adv., Counsel for Respondent No. 3 Award Claimants Ram Krishan, husband, Manjinder Kaur & Simranjit Kaur daughters, Ravinder Pal Singh son, have jointly filed this claim petition U/s 166 of Motor Vehicle Act seeking compensation to the tune of Rs. 40 Lacs on account of death of their wife / mother Smt. Sarbjit Kaur in motor vehicle accident caused by respondent No. 1 Sushil Kumar while driving offending vehicle i.e. Bus No. HP-58-A-6283 in a rash & negligent manner on 19-08-2015 at about 8.20 AM, in the area of Dhaliara Dehra, District Kangra (HP). 2. Facts put forth by claimants are that on 19-08-2015 deceased Sarabjit Kaur was going alongwith her husband on motorcycle bearing registration No. PB-65A-5960 to pay pilgrimage at 'Mata Jwala Ji Mandir'. At about 8.20 a.m., when they reached near Shiv Mandir, Dhaliara, then offending bus bearing No. HP-68A-6283 being driven by respondent No. 1 rashly & negligently came from backside and hit the motorcycle from backside, as a result of which both deceased and her husband fell down on the road and received multiple injuries on their person. Sarabjit Kaur died at the spot and her husband also suffered Ram Krishan etc Vs Sushil Kumar, MACT No. 05 of 16-05-2015, Case No. MACP / 261 / 2015, Date of decision : 06-04-2017 3 injuries and he was medically examined at Civil Hospital, Dehra (H.P.). Further claimants have averred that this accident took place due to rash & negligent driving of respondent No. 1 , Sushil Kumar and a FIR No. 115 dated 19-8-2015 was also registered under Sections 279, 427 & 304-A of IPC against respondent No. 1 with P. S. Dehra (Kangra). Therefore, respondent No. 1, Sushil Kumar being driver, respondent No. 2 being owner of the offending Vehicle in concurrence with respondent No. 3 insurer of the same are jointly & severally liable to pay compensation to the claimants as per provisions of Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act. Further claimants have averred that prior to the accident deceased Sarabjit Kaur was hale & hearty, very hardworking, intelligent and active. Due to the said accident, the claimants remained in great mental tension & agony. Therefore, respondents should be directed to pay at least Rs. 40 Lacs alongwith interest as compensation. 3. Upon notice, both respondents No. 1 & 2 have resisted this petition by filing their written reply jointly on the ground that a false case has been registered against them. No accident has taken place as alleged. It was, however, submitted that respondent No. 3 insurance company is liable to pay compensation. 4. Respondent No. 3 insurance company has contested the claim petition on the ground that at the time of accident respondent No. 1 did not possess any valid driving licence to drive the offending vehicle in question and further it was averred that owner of the offending Ram Krishan etc Vs Sushil Kumar, MACT No. 05 of 16-05-2015, Case No. MACP / 261 / 2015, Date of decision : 06-04-2017 4 vehicle was not holding valid registration & fitness certificate qua the same at the relevant time and thus there was clear violation of terms & conditions of the insurance policy. At the end it was also denied that any such accident took place with the offending vehicle on the given time and place as alleged by the claimants. It was also averred that a false FIR has been registered by the local police and other documents alleged to have been prepared by the hospital authorities are also false & fabricated. Besides this other averments of the claim petition were also denied that ultimately prayer for dismissal of the same was made. 5. From the pleadings of the parties following issues were framed : 1)Whether deceased Sarabjit Kaur died in a motor vehicle accident caused by respondent No.1 Sushil Kumar while driving Bus No. HP-58A-6283 in a rash & negligent manner on 18-8-2015 at 8.20 a.m. in the area Dhaliara, Dehra, Distt. Kangra(HP) ? OPP 2)Whether claimants are entitled to claim compensation. If so, to what extent and from whom ? OPP 3)Whether the petition is not maintainable ? OPR 4)Whether respondent No. 1 was not holding valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident ? OPR3 5)Whether respondent No. 2 was not having valid vehicular documents at the time of accident ? OPR3 6)Relief. 6. In order to substantiate their contention, claimants have examined CW1 Ram Krishan, CW2 Baldev Singh, CW3 Lachhman Singh and produced on record documents Ex.C1 to Ex.C6. Ram Krishan etc Vs Sushil Kumar, MACT No. 05 of 16-05-2015, Case No. MACP / 261 / 2015, Date of decision : 06-04-2017 5 7. To rebut evidence led by claimant, respondent No.3 has examined RW1 Ashwini Kumar dealing Clerk, RTO office, Kangra, RW2 Gurmail Singh, Superintendent, RLA Amb, District UNA and also produced documents Ex.R1 to Ex.R14 and closed the evidence. Respondent No. 1 & 2 has produced documents Ex.R1 to Ex.R4 and closed the evidence. 8. I have heard Sh. SPS Kanda, Advocate, learned counsel for claimants, Sh. G.S. Gill, Advocate, learned counsel for respondents No. 1 & 2 , Sh. Rajiv Abhi, Advocate, learned counsel for respondent No. 3 and have perused the entire record carefully with their valuable assistance. My issue-wise findings are as under: ISSUES No. 1 & 2 9. Both these issues are interconnected and in order to avoid repetition of discussion of evidence, these issues are taken up together. 10. Onus to prove these issues was on Claimants and Sh. SPS Kanda, Advocate, learned counsel for claimants relying upon statement made by Ram Krishan claimant as CW1 , who proved on record documents i.e. certified copy of FIR Ex.C1, certified copy of postmortem report Ex.C2, copy of his MLR Ex.C3, copies of school certificates of minors Ex.C4 to Ex.C6, and the statement of CW2 Baldev Singh, CW3 Lachhman Singh, has argued that claimants have been successful to prove that Sarabjit Kaur died on 19.8.2015 while claimant Ram Krishan Ram Krishan etc Vs Sushil Kumar, MACT No. 05 of 16-05-2015, Case No. MACP / 261 / 2015, Date of decision : 06-04-2017 6 alongwith his wife Sarabjit Kaur were going to pay pilgrimage at “ Mata Jwala Ji Mandir”, on his motorcycle No. PB-65A-5960, when they reached near Shiv Mandir Dhaliara, then a bus bearing Registration No. HP-58-A-6283 driven by Respondent no. 1 at a high speed in rash & negligent manner and without blowing any horn , came from back side and hit the motorcycle of the claimant. Due to the impact, both Ram Krishan & Sarabjit Kaur fell down. Sarabjit Kaur received injuries on her body and died at the spot whereas claimant Ram Krishan suffered injuries on his body. Claimants being husband and children of deceased Smt. Sarabjit Kaur respectively are entitled to a sum of Rupees Fourty Lacs on account of compensation in this regard from respondents, who are jointly and severally liable for paying the said amount. He has thus urged that this issue be decided in favour of petitioners and against respondents. 11. All these arguments have been vigorously refuted by Sh. G.S. Gill, Advocate, learned counsel for respondents No. 1 & 2 , Sh. Rajiv Abhi, Advocate, learned counsel for respondent No. 3, who have contended that evidence led on record by claimants does not prove that Sarabjit Kaur had died due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No. 1 Sushil Kumar. Claimants have failed to prove that accident has taken place due to rash and negligent act of driver of Bus. They have thus, urged that no responsibility can be fastened on respondents in this regard. Learned counsel for respondent No. 3, has further contended that no liability can be fastened on the respondent no. 3. They have thus Ram Krishan etc Vs Sushil Kumar, MACT No. 05 of 16-05-2015, Case No. MACP / 261 / 2015, Date of decision : 06-04-2017 7 urged that these issues be decided against petitioners and in favour of respondents. 12. I have given thoughtful consideration to these submissions and in order to appreciate the same, have gone through record of this Case minutely. 13. Onus to prove this issue was on the claimants. Since the present petition is under Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act, it is the bounden duty of the claimants to prove that respondent No. 1 was rash & negligent in driving the vehicle at the time of accident. In order to prove this issue, learned counsel for the claimant has relied upon statement of CW1 Ram Krishan, claimant also injured in the same accident wherein he has deposed that the accident took place on 19-08-2015 at about 8.20 AM, in the area near Shiv Mandir, Dhaliara, Dehra, Distt. Kangra, and the accident took place due to the rash & negligent driving of respondent No. 1, who caused the accident while driving the offending Vehicle i.e. Bus. This witness has further deposed that a criminal case bearing FIR No. 115 dated 19-08-2015 under Sections 279, 427 & 304-A of IPC was registered. Copy of FIR has been proved as Ex.C1. Claimants have examined CW2 Baldev Singh & CW3 Lachhman Singh, who have corroborated the version of the claimant CW1 Ram Krishan. These witnesses were thoroughly cross-examined by learned counsel for the respondents. The statements of these witnesses also stands corroborated from the copy of FIR. Ram Krishan etc Vs Sushil Kumar, MACT No. 05 of 16-05-2015, Case No. MACP / 261 / 2015, Date of decision : 06-04-2017 8 14. It has to be borne in mind that the Motor Vehicles Act does not envisage holding a trial for a Petition preferred under Section 166 of the Act. Under Section 168 of the Act, a Claims Tribunal is enjoined to hold an inquiry to determine compensation which must appear to it to be just. Strict rules of evidence are not applicable in an inquiry conducted by the Claims Tribunal. In State of Mysore Vs. S. S. Makapur, 1993 (2) SCR 943, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the Tribunals exercising quasi-judicial functions are not courts and are not bound by strict rules of evidence. The relevant portion of the report in State of Mysore (supra) is extracted hereunder: ""......that tribunals exercising quasi-judicial functions are not courts and that therefore they are not bound to follow the procedure prescribed for trial of actions in courts nor are they bound by strict rules of evidence. They can unlike courts, obtain all information for the points under the enquiry from all sources, and through all channels, without being fettered by rules and procedure, which govern proceedings in court. The only obligation which the law casts on them is that they should not act on any information which they may receive unless they put it to the party against whom it is to be used and give him a fair opportunity to explain it. What is a fair opportunity depend on the facts and circumstances of each case but where such an opportunity has been given, the proceedings are not open to Ram Krishan etc Vs Sushil Kumar, MACT No. 05 of 16-05-2015, Case No. MACP / 261 / 2015, Date of decision : 06-04-2017 9 attack on the ground that the enquiry was not conducted in accordance with the procedure followed in courts."" 15. In Bimla Devi and Ors. v. Himachal Road Transport Corporation and Ors., (2009) 13 SC 530, the Hon'ble Apex Court held that in a Petition under Section 166 of the Act, the Claimants were merely to establish their case on the touchstone of preponderance of probability and holistic view is to be taken while dealing with the Claim Petition under the Motor Vehicles Act . Para 15 is extracted hereunder: ""15. In a situation of this nature, the Tribunal has rightly taken a holistic view of the matter. It was necessary to be borne in mind that strict proof of an accident caused by a particular bus in a particular manner may not be possible to be done by the claimants. The claimants were merely to establish their case on the touchstone of preponderance of probability. The standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt could not have been applied."" 16. To determine the negligence of the driver of the offending vehicle, this court is guided by the judgment of Hon'ble High Court in case titled as National Insurance Company Limited Versus Pushpa Rani” 2009 ACJ 287 , wherein Hon'ble High Court has held that in case the petitioner files the certified copies of the criminal record or the criminal record showing the completion of the investigation by the Ram Krishan etc Vs Sushil Kumar, MACT No. 05 of 16-05-2015, Case No. MACP / 261 / 2015, Date of decision : 06-04-2017 10 police or issuance of charge sheet under Sections 279 / 304-A IPC or the certified copy of FIR or the recovery memo of the mechanical inspection report of the offending vehicle, then these documents are sufficient proof to reach to a conclusion that the driver was negligent. It was further held that the proceedings under the Motor Vehicle Act are not akin to the proceedings in a civil suit and hence strict rules of evidence are not required to be followed in this regard. Further in case titled as “Kaushnumma Begam & Others Versus New India Assurance Company Limited” 2001 ACJ 421 SC , the issue of wrongful act or omission on the part of driver of the motor vehicle involved in an accident has been left to a secondary importance and mere use or involvement of motor vehicle in causing bodily injuries or death to a human being or damage to property would make the petition maintainable U/s 166 of Motor Vehicle Act. It is also settled law that the term rashness and negligence has to be construed lightly while making a decision on a petition for claim for the same as compared to the word rashness and negligence as finds mention in the Indian Penal Code. This is because of the fact that the chapter in the Motor Vehicle Act dealing with compensation is a benevolent legislation and not a penal one. Therefore, from the evidence of CW1 Ram Krishan, CW2 Baldev Singh, CW3 Lachhman Singh in corroboration with copy of FIR Ex.P1, it is clear that respondent no. 1 was rashly & negligently driving the offending vehicle i.e. Bus bearing registration no. HP-58-A-6283 on the day of accident. Ram Krishan etc Vs Sushil Kumar, MACT No. 05 of 16-05-2015, Case No. MACP / 261 / 2015, Date of decision : 06-04-2017 11 17. Postmortem report of Sarabjit Kaur has been proved as Ex.P5, perusal of which shows that the death of Sarabjit Kaur was due to the injuries sustained in road side accident. In view of the above discussions and particularly in view of no controverting evidence on behalf of the respondent no. 1, driver of the offending vehicle, it stands proved on record that deceased Sarabjit Kaur sustained fatal injuries causing death due to the rash and negligent driving of respondent No. 1 while driving the offending vehicle. 18. So far as the entitlement of the claimants are concerned, claimant no. 1 is the husband, claimant no. 2 & 3 are the minor daughters and claimants No. 4 is minor son of the deceased. 19. Question arises as to how much compensation in this case can be granted to claimants. It is claim of claimants that Sarabjit Kaur was 41 years of age and was earning Rs. 30,000/- per month from Dairy Business, stitching and Boutique work . Her death has caused monetary loss to claimants and as such, they have suffered agony and unbearable pain as deceased were their parents and they are also entitled to compensation on account of mental agony, love and affection (sic) and as such, claimants are entitled to compensation to the tune of Rs. 40 lacs alongwith interest from the date of filing the petition till date of realization. So far as, the evidence of the income of Sarabjit Kaur is concerned, no document has been proved on record by the claimants nor any witness has been examined to prove that Sarabjit Kaur was doing any Ram Krishan etc Vs Sushil Kumar, MACT No. 05 of 16-05-2015, Case No. MACP / 261 / 2015, Date of decision : 06-04-2017 12 work or that she was earning Rs. 30,000/- as alleged. Dependency of the claimants is also to be considered. All these facts are to be taken while awarding amount of compensation to petitioners in this case. 20. Fact remains that deceased Sarabjit Kaur was a woman of 41 years. Since, there is no document to prove exact income, the notional income of a person is to be considered and as such, her income is assessed at Rs. 5000/- per month. She might be spending some amount upon herself and I deduct a sum of Rs. 2000/- as her personal expenses per month. That way, he had been contributing a sum of Rs. 36,000/- per year to claimants and keeping in view age of deceased, it is a fit case where multiplier of 12 can be applied. So, claimants can be awarded a sum of Rs. 4,32,000/- on account of loss of income. They are also entitled to Rs. 25,000/- as cremation expenses, a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- as consortium and Rs. 50,000/- on account of loss of love and affection. Accordingly, claimants are awarded compensation to the tune of Rs. 6,07,000/-. These issues are accordingly decided in favour of claimants and against respondents. ISSUE No. 3 & 5 21. Onus to prove these issues were on respondent No. 3, but no evidence has been led by these respondents to discharge their onus and consequently, these issues are decided against respondents and in favour of claimants. Ram Krishan etc Vs Sushil Kumar, MACT No. 05 of 16-05-2015, Case No. MACP / 261 / 2015, Date of decision : 06-04-2017 13 ISSUE No. 4 22. It is argued by learned counsel for the respondent No.3 that at the time of alleged accident, respondent No. 1 was not possessing valid & effective driving licence. He further contended that as per report & Ex.R17 issued by Registering Authority Una (HP) , the driving licence bearing no. DL/B/6530/2000-2001 has not been issued to Sushil Kumar respondent No. 1 23. Learned counsel for respondent No. 3 has contended that since respondent No. 1 was having valid driving licence, as such, insurance company cannot be made liable to pay any compensation. 24. Learned counsel for respondent No. 1 & 2 on the other hand has argued that the renewal of the driving licence of respondent No. 1 was valid & genuine. He further contended that none of the licensing authority stated in the court that the licence was not valid for offending vehicle. Respondent No.1 was never disqualified. Under these circumstances, where respondent No.1 was never disqualified from driving, he was competent to drive any type of vehicle. 25. I have considered the respective contentions and gone through the record carefully. Respondent no. 3 have proved on record documents Ex.R1 to Ex.R18. There is no dispute regarding these documents. Perusal of the documents Ex.R17 i.e. report of Registering Authority shows that the original license bearing no. DL/B/6530/2000- 2001 has not been issued by the registering authority. However, the Ram Krishan etc Vs Sushil Kumar, MACT No. 05 of 16-05-2015, Case No. MACP / 261 / 2015, Date of decision : 06-04-2017 14 documents Ex.R1 to Ex.R10 i.e. report of Registering Authority shows that the renewal of the license is genuine. The only question to be seen in this case is that whether the genuine renewal of a license can make a fake license genuine. What is fake does not become valid by its renewal. In fact it has no existence in the eyes of law. This is a case of no driving license being there with the respondent no. 1 Sushil Kumar driver when he was driving at the time of its accident. Further no benefit can be derived by a litigant like respondent no. 1 & respondent no. 2 on the basis of the license relied upon by them in this case which is established having not been issued by the concerned Licensing Authority. In these circumstances, in this case respondent no. 3 i.e. Insurance Company is not liable to pay any amount of compensation because there was no driving licence held by Sushil Kumar as envisaged by law governing the same. In the regard, reliance can be placed upon M/s. United India Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Davinder Singh, (SC) : 2007(4) R.C.R. (Civil) 790 wherein it has been held by Hon'ble Apex Court that Renewal of fake licence cannot transform a fake licence as genuine 26. Moreover, the Hon'ble Apex Court in Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Angad Ko1 2009(2) Apex Court Judgments 641 (S.C.), has held : “to drive a transport vehicle a distinct licence is required to be obtained where licence to drive is only for light motor vehicle. A driver cannot drive goods vehicle / transport vehicle without Ram Krishan etc Vs Sushil Kumar, MACT No. 05 of 16-05-2015, Case No. MACP / 261 / 2015, Date of decision : 06-04-2017 15 authorization. Driving a vehicle without there being a valid and effective driving licence amounted to breach of conditions of Insurance. Insurance Company cannot be made liable. However, insurance company directed to pay compensation and recover the same from driver and owner of the vehicle.” 27. In view of the above said law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court, I am of the considered opinion that in the present case also the insurance company cannot be made liable as the original license of the driver was fake and subsequent renewal cannot make the license genuine. However, insurance company can be directed to pay compensation and recover the same from the driver & owner of the offending vehicle. 28. Under these circumstances, I am inclined to hold that respondent No. 1 was not possessing valid & effective driving licence at the time of accident. Hence, this issue is decided in favour of respondent No. 3 and against respondents No. 1 & 2. ISSUE No. 6 (Relief) 29. In view of my findings on various issues, this claim petition succeeds and same is accepted and claimants are held entitled to Rs. 6,07,000/- from respondents, as compensation on account of death of Sarabjit Kaur. The amount of compensation will be apportioned as under : Claimant No.1 Rs. 2,32,000/- Claimants No. 2, 3, 4 (children) Rs. 1,25,000/- each Ram Krishan etc Vs Sushil Kumar, MACT No. 05 of 16-05-2015, Case No. MACP / 261 / 2015, Date of decision : 06-04-2017 16 This amount is to be paid within two months failing which claimants will be entitled to recover the compensation amount alongwith interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of claim petition till actual realization of the awarded amount. However, insurance company Respondent no. 3 is directed to pay compensation and recover the same from Respondent no. 1 & 2 (driver and owner of the vehicle i.e. bus bearing Registration No. HP-58-A-6283). In view of latest decision in Civil Revision No.7407 of 2010 by our Hon'ble High Court dated 3.6.2011 in case “Jyoti Burmi Vs. Anusandeep Burmi”, now it is desirable that if claimant no. 1 has any account in the Bank, then he will intimate to this court within one month and by way of notice to the respondents after receipt of certified copy of judgment. claimant no. 1 is also ordered to furnish the indemnity bonds within the above stipulated period in the court to indemnify the better claimants and respondents in case of appeal etc. After this compliance, the respondents are ordered to pay the award amount directly in the account of claimant no. 1 by RTGS or by way of draft or cross cheque in the name of claimant, so that cumbersome procedure of deposit and withdrawal from the court could be avoided by both the parties to save their own time as well as precious time of the court. The amount of minor claimants be deposited in fixed deposit in some nationalized bank and they can get the same encashed on attaining the age of majority. However, interest accrued thereon will be given to their father for the welfare of the minors. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.

Bector, Advocate Counsel for the Claimants. Sh. O.S. Rana, Advocate Counsel for the respdts no.1 and 2. Sh. D.R. Rampal, Advocate Counsel for the respondent no.3. A W A R D The claimants Rajwinder Kaur and her minor son Anmol Singh, through his mother and natural guardian Rajwinder Kaur has filed 2 the present claim petition for grant of compensation on account of death of. Rajwinder Singh in a motor vehicle accident. 2. The facts in brief are that on 26-05-2015, the deceased Rajwinder Singh along with his wife and son were coming from Village Sarinh to Ludhiana on a motor cycle bearing registration No.PB-29- U6527 for the treatment of his minor son. They were going at a very slow speed and on correct side of the road i.e. Near Kacha berm of the road. A about 8.45 AM, when they reached in the area of village Gill on Malerkotla-Ludhiana Road, a vehicle bearing no.PB-08AR-2396 came from behind on a very high speed in a rash and negligent manner and struck against the motor cycle of the deceased. Due to that they fell down on the road alongwith the motor cycle. The respondent no.1 dragged the motor cycle alongwith the deceased at some distance. Due to that deceased received multiple injuries. They also suffered injuries and due to that they were brought to guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Ludhiana, but the deceased died on the way to hospital. It is further averred that the deceased was hale and hearty prior to the accident and was earning hand of the claimants and they were fully dependent upon the deceased. He was very energetic and was very progressive mind person. A case under section 304-A IPC was registered against the respondent no.1 vide FIR No.96 dated 26.5.2015 at PS Sadar, Ludhiana. The deceased was 26 years old and was working in M/s Raj Bahadur Factory, Ludhiana and was also maintaining a dairy. He was earning Rs.20,000/- per month. The claimants have spent Rs 3 50,000/- approximately on the last rites of the deceased. The claimants have made prayer for the grant of compensation to the tune of Rs. 40,00,000/- along with interest. 3. Upon notice ,respondents no. 1 and 2 appeared through counsel and filed written statement wherein taking preliminary objections that the petition is not maintainable in the present form as no accident has taken place as alleged. No injury has been sustained by Rajwinder Singh son of Gurnam Singh in the alleged accident. False FIR has been registered at the instance of the claimants. On merits, all the material averments made by the claimants in claim petition have been denied by the respondents no 1 and 2 and prayed for the dismissal of the petition being false and frivolous. 4. Respondent no 3 i.e. insurance company appeared through counsel and filed separate written statement stating that the claim petition is not maintainable; bad for non joinder and mis joinder of necessary parties; the respondent no.1 was not possessing valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident and was not driving vehicle no.PB-08-AR-2396 in the course of his employment with the owner and insured of the vehicle and has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and also breached the provisions of Motor Vehicle Act. The insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation as the vehicle no.PB-08AR-2396, was not having valid registration certificate, permit and fitness certificate at the time of alleged accident and was being driven against the terms and conditions 4 of insurance policy and in violation of the Motor Vehicle Act. The owner and insured of the vehicle were fully aware that respondent no.1 did not possess valid and effective driving licence and they did not take due precaution and reasonable care and as such, the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. NO liability can be fasten on the answering respondent. The answering respondent takes all the defences under section 147,149,157,170 of the Motor Vehicle Act and reserves its right to file an amended written statement and additional written statement on disclosure of new facts. The liability of the answering respondent is subject to the section 64-VB of the Insurance Act. On merits, all the material averments made in the petition were denied and the averments made in the preliminary objections were reiterated and prayed for dismissal of the claim petition. 5. From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed: 1. Whether the claimants are entitled to compensation from the respondents on account of death of Rajwinder Singh in a motor vehicle accident caused by the rash and negligent driving by respondent no.1, if so, form whom and to what amount?OPP 2. Whether the claim petition is not maintainable?OPR 3. Whether the claim petition is bad for non joinder and mis joinder of necessary parties?OPR-3 4. Whether the respondent no.1 was not possessing valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident?OPR-3 5. Whether the offending vehicle no.PB-08AR-2396 was not having valid registration certificate, route permit and fitness certificate at the time of accident?OPR-3 6. Relief 5 In order to prove the case, the claimants examined PW-1 Rajwinder Kaur. Thereafter counsel for the claimants tendered into evidence the FIR Ex.P.X, postmortem report Ex.P.Y and salary certificate Ex.P.Z and closed the evidence. On the other hand, the, counsel for the respondents no.1 and 2 tendered into evidence the documents i.e. photo copy of the driving licence of the respondent no.1 Ex.R.1, Photocopy of the RC Mark-A, fitness certificate Mark-B, insurance policy Mark-C, Goods Carriage Permit Mark-D and Mark-E, receipt Mark-F and closed the evidence of respondents no.1 and 2. Counsel for the respondent no.3 tendered into evidence the copy of insurance policy Ex.R2 and closed the evidence. 6. I have heard the ld. Counsel for the parties and have gone through the file carefully. My issue wise findings are as under: Issues no.1 to 5 7. The claimants have filed the present claim petition that husband of the claimant no.1 and father of the claimant no.2 had died in the accident caused by the rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1 Gulab Singh,who was driving the vehicle bearing no.PB-08R-2396. In order to prove that the accident has taken place due to rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1, the claimant Rajwinder Kaur has come in the witness box as PW-1 and tendered her affidavit Ex.P.A. As per her, on 26.5.15, she alongwith Rajwinder Singh and minor son Anmol Singh was coming to Ludhiana on a motor cycle bearing no.PB-29-U-6527 for treatment of the minor son and when they 6 reached near the area of village Gill at Melerkotla Road, Ludhiana then a Tempo Eicher bearing no.PB-08AR-2396, came from behind and stuck against the motor cycle of the deceased. The driver of the Tempo was driving the vehicle rashly and negligently and due to the multiple injuries, Rajwinder Singh died in the Guru Teg Bahdur Hospital. In order to corroborate the oral statement, the claimant has proved on the file FIR Ex.P.X, on the file. 8. The counsel for the respondents has submitted that rash and negligent driving is not proved. But, I do not agree with this contention. In this case, the claimant Rajwinder Kaur was with the deceased Rajwinder Singh. Accident took place and she has narrated the version to the police as well as given the version how the accident has taken place in the court. Even FIR Ex.P.X was registered on her statement. It is settled principal of law that registration of the FIR is a strong circumstance to prove that accident has taken place. Reliance can be placed on Girdhari Lal vs Radhey Sham 1993(2) PLR, Page 109. Moreover, if the accident has not taken place as narrated by the claimant, then the best evidence available with the respondents is to examine the driver in the court, but the driver/respondent no.1 has not dared to appear in the witness box to depose on oath. So, non examination of the driver also prove that the accident has taken place due to rash and negligent driving. Thus, from the evidence on the file, it is proved that the accident has taken place due to rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1. 7 9. Now comes the question, whether the claimants are entitled to compensation. The applicants are the wife and son of deceased Rajwinder Singh. So, they are legal heirs of Rajwinder Singh and due to death of Rajwinder Singh, they have suffered. They have lost the only bread winner to bring them up in the society. So, the claimants are entitled to compensation on account of the accident caused by respondent no.1, while driving the tempo Eicher bearing no.PB-08AR- 2396. 10. Now comes the question, as to what compensation, the claimants are entitled. As per the averments made in the claim petition as well as in the affidavit tendered by PW-1 Rajwinder Kaur, the claimant was earning Rs.20,000/- per month by working in the factory M/s Raj Bahadur Factory, Ludhiana and also maintaining a dairy. But, this version of the claimants is not supported by any documents that the deceased Rajwinder Singh was not running any dairy. However, in order to prove that the claimant was working in the factory R.B. International and getting salary of Rs.7500/- per month, the claimant has placed on the file the certificate issued by the authorized signatory of RB International, which is Ex.P.Z, but no witness was examined to prove this. So, no reliance can be placed on this salary certificate. Even from this certificate, it is not established as to what work he was doing. So, he is to be taken as a labourer. As per the latest notification of the minimum wages, minimum wages of an unskilled worker is around Rs.6500/- per month. So, the income of deceased Rajwinder Singh is 8 taken as Rs.6500/- per month. Counsel for the claimants has submitted that deceased was 30 years of age, so benefit of addition of 50% as future prospects to be given to him upon the actual income. 11. Counsel for the respondents has submitted that he is only a labourer, so no addition of the future prospects can be given. But, I do not find any force in the arguments of counsel for the respondents. Hon'ble Apex court in Munna lal Jain and another, Appellant vs. Vipin Kumar Sharma and others, Respondent 2015(3) Law Herald 2526 has held that even if the deceased is self employed and below the age of 40 years, he is entitled to the addition of 50% towards future prospects. In the present case, as per the postmortem report, Ex.P.Y, the age of the deceased was 30 years. In view of the above judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court, for calculating income of the deceased Rajwinder Singh, 50% is to be added towards the future prospects. So, by adding 50% towards the future prospects, the monthly earning of the deceased, which is to be considered for calculating the compensation comes out to be Rs.9750/- per month. There are two claimants, so 1/3 rd is to deducted for the personal expenses of deceased Rajwinder Singh. Thus the dependency of the claimants comes out to be Rs.6500/- after deducting Rs.3250/- i.e. 1/3rd out of the income as personal expenses of deceased Rajwinder Singh. So far as, multiplier which is to be applied for calculating the compensation is concerned, as per the schedule attached with Motor Vehicle Act, the multiplier of 17 is to be applied, so the total 9 compensation comes out to be Rs.13,26,000/-. Apart from this, the claimant no.1 is entitled to Rs.1,00,000/- towards loss of consortium and claimant no.2 Anmol Singh is entitled to Rs.1,00,000/- towards the loss of love and affection as he has lost his father. They are also entitled to Rs.25,000/- towards the funeral expenses. Thus, the total compensation comes to Rs.15,51,000/-. 12. Now comes the question as to who is to pay compensation. The Tempo Eicher bearing no.PB-08AR-2396 which was being driven by Gulab Singh was in the ownership of Suresh Kumar and was insured with respondent no.3 United India Insurance Company Limited, Feroze Gandhi Market, Ludhiana. The respondent insurance company has taken the plea that the driver was not having a valid licence and the respondent no.1 and 2 have violated the terms and conditions of the policy, so the Insurance company is not liable to make the payment. But, in this case, the driving licence of the respondent no.1 is Ex.P.1 on the file. The insurance policy is Ex.R.2, registration certificate is Mark-B. There is no evidence led by the insurance company to prove that the driving licence of the respondent no.1 is fake. There is no evidence on the file that any terms and conditions of the insurance policy has been violated by respondent no.1 and 2. So, being the insurer of the Tempo Eicher bearing no.PB-08-AR-2396, the respondent no.3 United India Insurance Company Limited is liable to indemnify the claimants no.1 and 2 and to make the payment of the compensation. 13. In view of the above discussion, the claim petition is 10 very well maintainable and there is nothing on the file how it cannot be held that the petition is bad for non joinder and mis joineder of the necessary parties. With these observations, all these issues are decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. RELIEF 14. In view of my findings on the aforementioned issues, the petition succeeds and the same is allowed with costs and Award of Rs.15,51,000/- is passed in favour of the claimants and against the respondents alongwith pendentelite and future interest at the rate of 7.50% per annum on the award amount from the date of institution of claim petition till realization. The compensation is to be shared by claimants to the extent 50% to each claimant. The amount of the share of the minor claimant no.2 be deposited in the fixed deposit receipt in some nationalized bank, to be payable to the claimant on attaining the age of majority. As per latest decision in Civil Revision No. 7407 of 2010 dated 3-6-2011 of the Hon'ble High Court in the case of_ Jyoti Boormi versus Anu Sandeep Boormi, now it is desirable that if the claimants have any account in bank then they will intimate to this court within one month from the date of receipt of certified copy of the judgment and then by way of notice to the respondents after the receipt of certified copy of judgment.

Respondent No. 1 reportedly dead. AWARD 1.The present claim petition has been filed by the claimants for the grant of compensation to the tune of Rs.20,00,000/- on account of death of Baldev Singh son of Joga Singh due to road side accident. 2.The brief facts as averred in the claim petition are that on 24.10.2014 the informant namely Manjit Singh along with his two brothers namely Baldev Singh and Sukhdev Singh (both since deceased) were going from their home to Mandi Ahmedgarh to meet their sister Parmjit Kaur widow of late Harjit Singh, resident of Mandi Ahmedgarh. The deceased Baldev Singh was driving the Swift car bearing No. PB-10- CJ-1393 and the other deceased Sukhdev Singh was sitting beside him. The informant was following them on his Activa bearing No. PB-10-EG- 9780. At about 3.55 PM, when they reached near Mitran Da Dhabba in the jurisdiction of Village Sarinh, Police Station Dehlon, suddenly the offending Swift car bearing No. PB-10-CC-6635, came from behind, which was being driven by the respondent No. 1 at very high speed, rashly and negligently and without blowing the horn, hit against the car No. PB-10-CJ-1393 at its backside, in which the above named brothers of the informant were sitting, turned turtle and its face turned towards village Gill, while the offending car barged in to the nearby fields. Many peoples gathered at the spot. The informant managed to take out his said two brothers out of their car with great difficulty with the help of passersby and took them in an Ambulance to DMC Hospital and got them admitted (3) MACP-76/2015 Harpreet Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jaspreet Singh there. During the course of his treatment, Baldev Singh has expired in DMC Hospital, due to the serious multiple injuries sustained by him in the above said accident, which proved fatal for him. The other brother namely Sukhdev Singh, who too have suffered multiple injuries expired later on. Their car was also badly damaged. This accident took place due to negligent, careless and rash driving of the offending car by its driver- respondent No. 1 at very high speed and without blowing the born striking it behind the car of Baldev Singh. An FIR No. 145 dated 25.10.2014 under Sections 279, 337, 338, 304A, 427 IPC was registered at Police Station Dehlon against the respondent No. 1 on the statement of informant Manjit Singh son of Joga Singh, resident of House No. 101, Street No. 1, Bachittar Nagar, Opposite G.N.E. College, Ludhiana. So, the claimants are entitled to compensation to the tune of Rs. 20 Lacs on account of accidental death of the deceased Baldev Singh son of Joga Singh. Hence the present claim petition. 3.Notice of the present claim petition was issued to the respondents. It is pertinent to mention here that earlier Baldev Singh son of Kartar Singh, resident of Village Ayali Khurd, District Ludhiana was impleaded as respondent No. 2 in the present claim petition. However, on 3.5.2016 the claimants moved an application under Order 6 Rule 17 CPC for amendment of claim petition by alleging that the name of the respondent No. 2 Baldev Singh is to be deleted as now it has come to the knowledge of the claimants that respondent No. 2 Baldev Singh has already sold the offending vehicle to respondent No. 1 Jaspreet Singh. Accordingly, above said application for amendment of claim petition was (4) MACP-76/2015 Harpreet Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jaspreet Singh allowed and name of respondent No. 2 Baldev Singh was ordered to be deleted from array of the respondent by this court vide order dated 3.5.2016. 4.The respondent No. 1 Jaspreet Singh appeared through counsel and contested the present claim petition by filing written statement wherein he has taken preliminary objections that the present claim petition is not maintainable and answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation as the vehicle of answering respondent was insured with respondent No. 3 and the respondent No. 1 had a valid and effective driving license. Moreover, the alleged accident did not took place with the vehicle of the answering respondent and the same has been falsely implicated. On merits, it has been pleaded that a false and frivolous FIR has been registered against the respondent No. 1. It has been admitted that answering respondent was the driver of Swift car bearing No. PB-10-CJ-1393 but the same has not caused any accident as alleged. He denied that multiple grievous injuries including the head injuries as mentioned in postmortem report were sustained by the deceased in this accident and that the same proved fatal for him or he expired at DMC Hospital, Ludhiana as alleged. Rest of the averments are denied in general, with prayer for dismissal of the present claim petition. 5.From the pleadings of the parties following issues were framed vide order dated 5.8.2016:- 1.Whether Baldev Singh son of Joga Singh died in a motor vehicle accident, which took place on 24.10.2014 due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle i.e. Swift car bearing registration (5) MACP-76/2015 Harpreet Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jaspreet Singh No. PB-10-CC-6635, which was being driven and owned by the respondent No. 1? If so, its effect? OPC 2.If issue No. 1 is proved, whether the claimants are entitled to compensation as alleged? If so, to what extent and from which of the respondent? OPC 3.Whether the claim petition is maintainable in the present form? OPC 4.Relief. 6.It is pertinent to mention here that when the present claim petition was fixed for evidence of the claimants, respondent No. 1 Jaspreet Singh has expired. Counsel for the respondent No. 1 has placed on record copy of death certificate of respondent No. 1 on the record, which shows that respondent No. 1 Jaspreet Singh son of Kuldeep Singh was expired on 17.08.2016. Learned counsel for claimants wants to bring on record the Legal Representatives of respondent No. 1 on file by filing an application in this regard but he failed to do so despite availing numerous opportunities and last opportunity. Consequently, on 31.1.2017 when nobody has come present on behalf of LRs of respondent No. 1, so the present claim petition was fixed for evidence of the claimants. 7.In order to prove her case, the claimant no.1 Harpreet Kaur herself stepped in to witness box as CW1 and examined Manjit Singh as CW2. In documentary evidence, the claimant has proved on record documents i.e. copy of FIR as Ex.C1, copies of birth certificates of claimants as Ex.C2 to Ex.C4, copy of IT Return of deceased Baldev Singh as Ex.C5, copies of death certificates of deceased as Ex.C6 and Ex.C7, (6) MACP-76/2015 Harpreet Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jaspreet Singh copy of postmortem examination of deceased as Ex.C8, copy of her Aadhaar Card as Ex.C9. Thereafter claimant No. 1 closed her evidence. 8.I have heard learned counsel for the claimants and with his able assistance have gone through the documents and evidence placed on record by him very carefully and minutely. My issue wise findings are as under:- ISSUES NO. 1 & 2 9.Both these issues are taken up together for the purpose of convenience being interconnected and in order to avoid repetition. The onus to prove both these issues was placed upon the claimants and in order to prove these issues, the claimant No. 1 Harpreet Kaur herself stepped into witness box as CW1 and she deposed by way of affidavit Ex.CA and reiterated the facts contained in the claim in the petition. She testified that she is widow of Baldev Singh. Her husband died in a road accident due to the negligence of respondent No. 1, who was the driver as well as owner of the offending vehicle bearing No. PB-10-CC-6635. On 24.10.2014, Manjit Singh along with his two brothers namely Baldev Singh and Sukhdev Singh were going from their house to Mandi Ahmedgarh to meet their sister Paramjit Kaur. The deceased Baldev Singh was driving Swift car bearing No. PB-10-CJ-1393 and other deceased Sukhdev Singh was siting besides him. Manjit Singh was following them on his Activa scooter bearing No. PB-10-EG-9780. At about 3.55 PM, when they reached near Mitran Da Dhaba, another Swift car bearing No. PB-10-CC-6635 came from behind, which was being driven by respondent no. 1 at a very high speed rashly and negligently and without (7) MACP-76/2015 Harpreet Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jaspreet Singh blowing the horn, hit in car No. PB-10-CJ-1393 and its back, as a result of which, both the occupants of the car got struck in it because the car turned turtle and barged into the nearby fields. Manjit Singh managed to take out his said two brothers out of their car with great difficulty, with the help of passersby and took them in an Ambulance to DMC Hospital and got them admitted there. During the course of treatment, Baldev Singh expired in DMC Hospital due to the serious multiple injuries sustained by him in the above said accident. The other brother namely Sukhdev Singh, who too have suffered multiple injuries expired later on. Their car was also badly damaged. FIR No. 145 dated 25.10.2014 under Sections 279, 337, 338, 304A, 427 IPC was registered on the statement of Manjit Singh in Police Station Dehlon against respondent No. 1. She testified that the deceased was earlier doing Lucrative job in Kuwait and was earning handsomely and after return to India, he was engaged in retail sale business for the past one year. His earning was not less than Rs.40,000/- per month. She along with claimants No. 2 to 4 was totally dependent upon the deceased. She placed on record copy of FIR as Ex.C1, copies of birth certificates of claimants as Ex.C2 to Ex.C4, copy of IT Return of deceased Baldev Singh as Ex.C5, copies of death certificates of deceased as Ex.C6 and Ex.C7, copy of postmortem examination of deceased as Ex.C8, copy of her Aadhaar Card as Ex.C9. She further testified that the deceased was the sole earning member in the family and the claimants were totally dependent upon the deceased. She further testified that the respondent No. 1 being the owner and driver of the car is liable to pay the compensation to the claimants to the tune of Rs.20 Lacs. The eyewitness Manjit Singh (8) MACP-76/2015 Harpreet Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jaspreet Singh has been examined as CW2, who has deposed by way of affidavit Ex.CB and corroborated the statement made by CW1. He has testified as per the statement made by CW1 Harpreet Kaur regarding the accident to the effect that he witnessed the accident of two swift cars, in which his brothers Baldev Singh and Sukhdev Singh have died. He testified that the deceased was not earning less than Rs.40,000/- per month. He was the sole earning member of the family. 10.Besides oral evidence, the claimant has also proved on record copy of FIR as Ex.C1, copies of birth certificates of claimants as Ex.C2 to Ex.C4, copy of IT Return of deceased Baldev Singh as Ex.C5, copies of death certificates of deceased as Ex.C6 and Ex.C7, copy of postmortem examination of deceased as Ex.C8, copy of her Aadhaar Card as Ex.C9, besides other documents. 11.On the other hand, the respondent No. 1, who earlier contested the petition and filed written statement later on died and none of his legal representatives come forward to contest the petition. 12.The respondent No. 1 alleged driver and owner of Swift car No. PB-10-CC-6635 has since expired during the pendency of the petition and none of his legal representatives appeared to contest the petition, so as per the settled principle of law that if the driver does not come into the witness box to depose regarding the accident, then adverse inference can be drawn against him. Our own Hon'ble High Court in case titled as Bhagwani Devi Vs. Krishan Kumar Saini and others, reported in 1986 Accident Claim Journal at page 331 has held as under:- “The cause of accident can best be explained by the drivers (9) MACP-76/2015 Harpreet Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jaspreet Singh concerned and if they are kept away from the witness box without any sound reasons, it must indeed be construed as telling circumstance against the respondents”. Similar view has been taken by our Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in case titled as Raju and others Vs.Sukhwinder Singh and others, reported in 2006 (4) RCR (Civil) at page 82 that:- “Negligence of the driver- Adverse inference- If the driver of the offending vehicle does not come forward to deny his negligence, then adverse inference is to be drawn in favour of the claimants and the driver is presumed to be negligent”. 13.So, I find that the respondent No. 1 or his legal representatives have failed to contest the petition filed by the claimants, so they have failed to prove that the accident had not taken place due to the rash and negligent act of respondent No. 1. They have also failed to deny the factum of accident and non appearance of the driver in the witness box to depose regarding accident clearly shows that he has impliedly admitted the accident as alleged by the claimants. So, from the evidence lead by the claimants, I have found that it is established on record that respondent No. 1 Jaspreet Singh alias Jassi drove his Swift car bearing No. PB-10-CC-6635 in a rash and negligent manner and struck the same from behind with the Swfit car being driven by the deceased Baldev Singh on the road as a result of which Baldev Singh received multiple and grievous injuries on the vital parts of his body and ultimately died on account of said injuries in DMC Hospital. Moreover, FIR Ex.C1 bearing No. 145 dated 25.10.2014 was also registered against the (10) MACP-76/2015 Harpreet Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jaspreet Singh respondent No. 1 driver in PS Dehlon, District Ludhiana on account of his rash and negligent driving and thereby causing death of Baldev Singh and Sukhdev Singh on the road. So, it is held that the accident took place on account of rash and negligent driving of the driver of vehicle bearing No. PB-10-CC-6635, who has been arrayed as respondent No. 1. In these circumstances of the case, I find that there is no dispute with regard to the accident. So, in view of my above discussion, reasons and findings, it is held that Baldev Singh died in a road side accident on 24.10.2014 due to rash and negligent driving of the driver Jaspreet Singh while driving Swift car No. PB-10-CC-6635, which was also owned by him. Accordingly, it is held that Baldev Singh son of Joga Singh died in a motor vehicle accident, which took place on 24.10.2014 due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle i.e. Swift car bearing registration No. PB- 10-CC-6635, which was owned and being driven by respondent No. 1 himself. Therefore, the claimants are entitled to compensation on account of accidental death of Baldev Singh. 14.The present claim petition regarding death of Baldev Singh has been filed by Harpreet Kaur being widow, the claimants no.2 to 4 are the minor daughters and son of deceased Baldev Singh for compensation of Rs.20 Lac being LRs and dependents of Baldev Singh. Perusal of file reveals that since the respondent No. 1 and his legal representatives have preferred not to come forward to contest the petition, so the statements made by Harpreet Kaur while appearing as CW1 and Manjit Singh while appearing as CW2 have gone unrebutted and there is nothing on record to disbelieve the same. So, the respondent No.1 has failed to put any dent on (11) MACP-76/2015 Harpreet Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jaspreet Singh the statements made by the claimant No. 1 that the claimants are the legal heirs of deceased Baldev Singh. The respondent No. 1 has also failed to prove that Manjit Singh was not present on the spot as an eyewitness and has not seen the accident, in which Baldev Singh received fatal injuries in the roadside accident and in the said roadside accident, the respondent No. 1 Jaspreet Singh was driving his Swift car bearing No. PB-10-CC-6635. So, from the evidence on record it is clearly proved that the claimants were dependent upon the deceased Baldev Singh and therefore, I find that the claimants are entitled for compensation from the respondent No. 1 through his legal representatives. 15.So far as quantum of compensation is concerned, deceased Baldev Singh was 48 years of age at the time of accident as claimed and proved. The age of the deceased has been proved from the medical record of CHC, Dehlon, which is the postmortem report Ex.C8 and there is no rebuttal to this evidence led by the claimants. The claimants have alleged that the deceased Baldev Singh was earning Rs.40,000/- per month but they have proved on record the Income Tax Return of deceased Baldev Singh for the assessment year 2013-2014 as Ex.C5, which shows the gross annual total income was Rs.2,19,962/- rounded up to Rs.2.20 Lacs per annum. As per the law laid down by Apex Court in “Santosh Devi Vs. National Insurance Co., ltd., and others' reported in 2012, ACJ, 1428’ , it has been held that future aspects have also to be seen while assessing income of the deceased. However, it is also held in this case law that when the deceased was self employed or was on a fixed salary (without provision for annual increments etc.,) the Courts will usually take only (12) MACP-76/2015 Harpreet Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jaspreet Singh actual income at the time of death and a departure therefrom should be made only in rare and exceptional cases involving special circumstances. However, it has been held by Hon'ble Apex Court in Rajesh and others Vs. Rajbir Singh and others, reported in 2013, Accident Claim Journal, at page 1493 that the principle of assessment of future prospects may also be applied to persons, who were self employed or were engaged on fixed wages and hence, 50% of actual income for persons below 40 years can be added as future prospects. A similar view was taken by our Hon'ble Apex Court in Smt.Neeta Vs. The Divisional Manager, reported in 2015 (1) RCR (Civil), at page 625 that even in the case of private employment, the future prospects can be taken into consideration to determine the loss of dependency. However, since the deceased was 48 years old at the time of accident, so the future prospects are not to be taken into consideration. So, in my view his monthly salary is to be treated as Rs.18,300/- per month and he must have used 1/4 of this for his own living expenses and remaining 3/4 was being contributed to the claimants no.1 to 4, who are his widow and minor children. So, total dependency comes to Rs.13,725/- per month. Hence, annual dependency of Baldev Singh was Rs.13,725/- x 12= Rs.1,64,700/- per annum and as per guidelines given by the Hon'ble Apex Court in 'Sarla Verma vs Delhi Transport Corporation, reported in 2009 (3) R.C.R. (Civil) at page 77’, 13 is the multiplier having regard to the age of deceased at the time of accidental death. So, total loss of dependency came to Rs.21,41,100/-. In addition to that, the claimants are entitled to get Rs.25,000/- as funeral expenses and claimant no.1 is also entitled to Rs.1,00,000/- for loss of consortium, Rs.1,00,000/- each of the (13) MACP-76/2015 Harpreet Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jaspreet Singh minor children, and Rs.1,00,000/- to the widow for loss of love and affection as per law laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court in 'Vimal Kanwar and others Vs. Kishore Dan and Others reported in 2013, ACJ, at page 1441’. Consequently, total amount comes to Rs.26,66,100/- (rounded to Rs. 26.66 Lacs) as compensation and respondent no.1 through his legal representatives is liable to pay the above said amount to the claimants. Accordingly, both these issues No. 1 and 2 are decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondent No. 1. ISSUE NO.3 16.Onus to prove this issue was upon the claimants. In view of my findings on issues No. 1 and 2 above, it is held that the petition as filed by claimants is maintainable in its present form. Hence, this issue is decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondent No. 1. RELIEF 17.In view of my above discussion, reasons and findings given above, the claim petition filed by the claimants is accepted, with costs. Since the respondent No. 1 died and his legal representatives preferred not to contest the claim and no particulars of respondent No. 2 Insurance Company have been brought on record, so the liability of respondent No. 2 is absolved. Accordingly, the respondent no. 1 through his legal representatives is directed to pay Rs. 26.66 Lacs as total compensation along with interest @ 6% p.a. from the date of filing of petition till the date of actual payment to the claimants as compensation within three months from the date of award failing which the claimant are entitled to recover the compensation amount along with interest @ 7.5 % p.a. as (14) MACP-76/2015 Harpreet Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jaspreet Singh mentioned above through the competent court of law. Keeping in view the age and liability of dependency of the claimants, amount of claim is distributed as under:- 1.Claimant no.1 widow 55%, 2. Claimant no.2 (minor daughter) 15%, 3. Claimant no.2 (minor daughter) 15%, 4. Claimant no. 4 (minor son) 15%, Since the claimants No. 2 to 4 are minor children, so their share be deposited in their names through their mother in the shape of FDRs in some Nationalized Bank, which shall be paid to them on attaining the of age of majority. Counsel fee is assessed at Rs.1500/-. Memo of costs be prepared and file be consigned to the record room. Announced in open court.

Page: 2 Vipan Kumar vs. Jagjit Singh & Ors. MACT No.55 of 24.3.2015 AWARD 1.The present is a claim petition filed by the claimant seeking compensation for the grant of compensation of Rs.25,00,000/- (twenty five lacs) alongwith interest @ 12% per annum from the date of accident till realisation of the compensation amount, on account of multiple grievous injuries suffered by the claimant in a road side accident caused due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle truck No.PB- 10-DZ-3291 by the respondent No.2 on 12.12.2014 at about 1:30 P.M.near Police Station Basti Jodhewal, while the claimant was driving his Activa scooter bearing registration No.PB-10-DX-3916 and followed by his brother Anil Kumar who was on his scooter Maestro bearing registration No.PB-10-EF-9302. 2.Consequent upon notice of the claim petition, the respondents contested the same by filing their separate written statements. Respondents No.1 and 2 filed written statement taking preliminary objection that respondent No.2 has not caused the accident with the claimant. On merits, the mode and manner of the accident has been denied. It is denied that a sum of Rs.10 lacs has been spent on the treatment of claimant and Rs.One lac is being spent every month on his treatment. While denying all other averments, it has ultimately been prayed that the claim petition be dismissed. 3.Respondent No.3 filed its separate written statement taking preliminary objections that claim petition is not maintainable since no accident has ever taken place as alleged in the claim petition. The present Page: 3 Vipan Kumar vs. Jagjit Singh & Ors. MACT No.55 of 24.3.2015 claim is bad for non joinder of necessary parties since owner and insurance company of scooter Activa No.PB-DX-3916 is not impleaded as party in the petition. The answering respondent No.3 is not responsible for any compensation as is mentioned in the claimpetition since respondent No.1 Jagjit Singh, the driver of truck bearing registration No.PB-10DZ-3291 did not hold valid and effective driving licence on the date of alleged accident. Respondent No.2 as such have committed willful default and breach in terms and conditions of insurance policy by handing over the vehicle in question to the driver i.e. respondent No.1 knowing fully well that respondent No.1 did not possess and hold a valid and effective driving licence issued by any competent authority. Even respondent No.1 was not driving the truck in question in the course of his employment with respondent No.2. The truck No.PB-10-DZ-3291 did not have the valid registration certificate, route permit and fitness certificate at the time of alleged accident and was being driven against the provisions of Motor Vehicle Act. Respondent No.3 takes all the defences available to insurance company under Section 147, 149, 157, 158(6) and 170 of the Motor Vehicle Act and respondent No.3 reserves it right to amend the written statement on disclosure of new facts and circumstances. The liability of the respondent No.3 is limited as per Motor Vehicle Act provided the vehicle in question is insured with respondent No.3 and terms and conditions of insurance policy are complied with, however the liability of the respondent No.3 is denied. The petition is not maintainable unless and until the claimant confirms that no other petition has been filed Page: 4 Vipan Kumar vs. Jagjit Singh & Ors.

Claim Petition under Section 166 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. -00- Present:Shri Sumit Jain, Advocate, for claimant. Respondents No.1 and 2 exparte. Shri Vyom Bansal, Advocate, for respondent no.3. AWARD 2 This petition, under Section 166 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 has been filed by claimant seeking compensation from respondents no.1 to 3 on account of suffering of injuries by her in a motor vehicular accident on 13.9.2014 caused by respondent No.2 by driving Canter bearing No. HR-55-Q-8307 in a rash and negligent manner near the bridge opposite to Village Mandyala Kalan, Distt.Ludhiana. She averred in the petition that she is just 28 years old and is Teacher with Max Arthur Macauliffe Public School, Chandigarh Road, Samrala, Distt. Ludhiana. Her monthly income is Rs. 15,000/-. On 13.9.2014 she and her husband Aruninder Singh were on their Honda Activa scooter bearing No. PB-26- E-1056 and were coming from Khanna, Distt. Ludhiana side to Manji Sahib Kota Gurudwara to pay obeisance. Her maternal uncle Gurcharan Singh resident of Kotla Ajner, Tehsil Khamano, Distt. Fatehgarh Sahib had come to visit her at Khanna. He also was going with them to the said Gurdawara Sahib on motorcycle No. PB-23-N-7936. Claimant was sitting pillion on the abovesaid Honda Activa Scooter. Her husband was driving the same at a slow speed following all the traffic rules. At about 1.30 PM they reached near bridge of Village Mandyala Kalan, Distt. Ludhiana. By then a Canter bearing registration No. HR-55-Q-8307 came from behind which was being driven by respondent No.2 recklessly, without blowing horn and in a negligent manner. It collided into the Honda Activa Scooter of complainant party. The claimant and her husband fell on the road and suffered multiple grievous injuries. Said scooter also was damaged. The Canter driver fled away in the said vehicle. Both the injured were 3 removed by Gurcharan Singh to Kular Hospital, Bija and since their condition was critical, they were referred to Satguru Partap Singh Apollo Hospital, Ludhiana. Due to this occurrence the eyewitness Gurcharan Singh had got lodged FIR No.163 dated 15.9.2014 under sections 279,337,338,427 IPC with P.S. Sadar, Khanna. Claimant had suffered multiple grievous injuries on her body including serious head injury. She had suffered huge blood loss due to bleeding. Her CT Scan of head done on 13.9.2014 brought out that there was bone fracture and brain injury. On that very day she underwent open Craniotomy operation. Blood transfusion and other supportive system was given. She was discharged from the Hospital on 29.9.2014 and had to spend Rs. 3,02,725/- for treatment. She was again admitted there on 21.10.2014 for V.T.Shunt and was operated upon on that day and was discharged on 23.10.2014. She had to spend Rs. 1,05,072/- at that time. She obtained follow-up treatment. She again was admitted in the Hospital on 13.11.2014 for Bone Flap replacement and was discharged from Hospital on 15.11.2014. This time she spent Rs. 86,293/-. In total she spent Rs. 4,94,090/- for such hospitalization and medical treatment. She still is under treatment and is spending for medical check ups and medicines etc. The involved canter is owned by respondent No.1 and was insured with respondent No.3. Prior to this occurrence the claimant was having good health. Due to this accident she now has become permanently disabled and incapacitated. A permanent pipe has been placed from her head to stomach. This pipe remains visible. She also had to undergo open brain and head surgery. 4 Now she is unable to lead a normal life. She cannot understand or follow commands. She also suffers fits of unconsciousness. Her intellectual capacity has also been affected. She has suffered huge pain and agony due to these injuries. She is prescribed special diet and medicines for rest of her life which involves unbearable expenditure. She has to engage a maid during and after medical treatment for domestic help and for her personal care whom she is paying Rs. 4,000/- per month. Claimant has suffered loss of income as well since she is not able to attend school service. Hence, the petition whereby she has prayed for compensation of Rs. 50 lakhs with interest. 3.Due notice of petition was given to the respondents. However, the owner and driver of above referred Canter i.e respondents No.1 and 2 preferred not to appear. They were treated exparte. Respondent No.3 filed its written statement wherein the entire version of claim petition was controverted. It was denied if this respondent was liable to pay compensation to claimant. As per this respondent the driver and owner of offending Truck had not complied with the terms and conditions of insurance policy and that t he current petition is not maintainable and also is bad for non-joinder of necessary parties. With such averments, respondent No.3 prayed for dismissal of claim petition. 4.On such pleadings, following issues were framed on 18.11.2015: 1.Whether the claimant suffered injuries on account of the accident took place on 13.9.2014 on account of the motor vehicle accident caused by respondent No.1(2) while driving 5 an offending vehicle Canter Truck bearing N. HR-55-Q-8307 in a rash and negligent manner?OPP. 2.If issue No.1 is proved in affirmative, whether the claimant is entitled to recover the compensation, if so, from which of the respondents and to what amount?OPP. 3.Whether there is no cause for filing the present claim petition?OPR 4.Whether the present petition is bad for non-joinder of necessary parties?OPR 5.Relief. 5.To prove her version claimant firstly herself deposed as CW1 and also examined her husband/eyewitness Aruninder Singh as CW2; eyewitess Gurcharan Singh as CW3; Gurnail Singh, Accountant from Market Committee, Machhiwara, Distt. Ludhiana as CW4; HC Mohinder Singh as CW5; Gurdeep Singh as CW6; Dr. Ketal Gupta from SPS Apollo Hospital, Ludhiana as CW7; tendered documents Ex C62 to Ex C100 and thereafter closed her evidence. 6.Respondent No.3 tendered copy of insurance policy of offending vehicle as Ex R1, reports of licencing authority Kolkata as Ex R2 as Ex R3 and closed its evidence. 7.I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record. My issue-wise findings are as under:- ISSUES NO.1 AND 2. 8.Both these issues are interconnected, and, therefore, are being taken up together for disposal to avoid repetition of discussion. 6 9.To prove these issues, claimant has examined above noted 7 C.Ws. She herself deposed as CW1. Her husband and injured Aruninder Singh has deposed as CW2 while the eyewitness and author of FIR of involved incident i.e Gurcharan Singh has deposed as CW3. Their examinations-in-chief are verbatim repetition of version in the petition about as to how the alleged incident took place whereby the above referred Honda Activa Scooter of CW2 was hit by the above referred Canter in the area of Village Mandlyala Kalan on 13.9.2014 at about 1.30 PM. These witnesses detailed out that at the time of such ill-fated occurrence this scooter was being driven by CW2 and his wife i.e claimant was sitting pillion with him on that vehicle and when they reached abovesaid place, the Canter, being driven by respondent No.2 and bearing No. HR-55-Q-8307, came from behind which as per them was being driven rashly and negligently by respondent No.2 which caused the collision of both these vehicles throwing both scooter occupants CW1 and CW2 on the road resulting in multiple grievous injuries on their bodies. These CW1 to CW3 also stated that it was CW3 who had removed them to the Hospital and also had got lodged FIR about this occurrence, copy of which is Ex C1. Cross-examination conducted on these three C.Ws by appearing respondent No.3 Insurance Company more or less is suggestive only where nothing shattering depositions of these C.Ws came. As per these witnesses the offending Canter is owned by respondent No.1 and was insured with respondent No.3. This aspect also has gone uncontroverted in their cross-examinations. Incidentally, and importantly, 7 the said owner and offending driver respondents No.1 and 2 have preferred not to appear and to contest the petition thereby impliedly admitting the version of these C.Ws about the occurrence having been caused by rash and negligent driving of abovesaid Canter by respondent No.2 at the given time and place. By virtue of such un-shattered depositions of CW1 to CW3, the three eyewitnesses, I conclude that the claimant has established on file that it was respondent No.2, by whose rash and negligent driving of said Canter the involved occurrence had taken place causing injuries to claimant. 10.CW1 claimant also has proved on file during her deposition a copy of registration certificate (RC) of offending Canter in the name of respondent No.1 as EX C53, copy of its insurance policy and its attending document as Ex C54 and Ex C55, copy of driving licence (DL) of respondent No.2 as Ex C56, copy of RC of ill-fated Honda Activa scooter of CW2 as Ex C57 and copy of his driving licence as Ex C58. Except for document Ex C56 (DL) no other document has been disputed by contesting respondent No.3 insurance company during its evidence. It had called for the report of concerned Licencing Authority, Kolkata same is Ex R2 and shows that the said driving licence (Ex C56) was never issued by said Licencing Authority which brings out that the respondent No.2 did not have a valid driving licence in his name on the day of involved occurrence. On the strength of such outcome the Ld. Counsel for respondent No.3 has asserted that this respondent No.3 be exonerated of the liability but he failed to controvert the contention of claimant that the 8 violation of insurance policy condition by owner/driver like respondents No.1 and 2 cannot exonerate the insurance company from its liability towards a 3rd party like the current claimant with whom this company had no privity of contract. This insurance company may seek recovery rights against respondent No.1 owner of offending Canter. 11.In view of the discussion made in the preceding lines above, I conclude that the owner of offending vehicle i.e respondent No.1, its driver i.e respondent No.2 as well as the insurer of this vehicle respondent No.3 are liable to compensate claimant for the injuries suffered by her due to rash and negligent driving of above said Canter by respondent No.2. 12.With regard to bringing on file the quantum about such claim, the claimant, in her deposition as CW1, has reiterated the version of petition in detail reflecting suffering of head and brain injuries, undergoing of surgeries twice, her hospitalization on three occasions for a considerable period and then spending of huge amount on her treatment which as per her still continues. She proved on file her medical bills and discharge summary as Ex C2 to C48. These bills are worth Rs. 5,40,912/-. Claimant also has examined CW4 Gurmail Singh, Accountant from Market Committee, Machhiwara. This witness stated that husband of claimant i.e CW2 is working as Mandi Supervisor with said Market Committee who had submitted the medical bills of claimant with the department for reimbursement. The bills are Ex C3 and Ex C5 respectively valued Rs. 3,02,725/- and Rs. 1,05,072/-. This CW4 then stated that from this claimed amount the department had reimbursed only 9 Rs. 1,73,547/- to claimant and letter regarding it is Ex C59. It means that from the claimed amount Rs. 5,40,912/-, the claim of reimbursement of Rs. 1,73,547/- by the Employer of husband of claimant has already been passed in her favour. The remaining amount Rs. 3,67,365/-, therefore,is liable to be paid by respondents to claimant towards such medical expenses. 13.Claimant also has examined CW7 Dr. Ketal Gupta who proved on file the documents Ex C61 and Ex C62. In examination-in- chief he reiterated the entire pleadings of petition that claimant was admitted in SPS Apollo Hospital, Ludhiana on 13.9.2014 due to suffering of multiple grievous injuries in road accident. She had suffered serious head injury and blood loss. She underwent open brain surgery on that day. She then underwent V.P.Shunt (placing of a permanent tube in her body) on 21.10.2014 and then had to undergo another operation on 13.11.2014 for bone flap placement. This witness stated that due to these injuries the claimant has become disabled and incapacitated which will make her unable to lead a normal life. She suffers fits of unconsciousness. Her intellectual capacity has been affected and she also had suffered permanent hearing loss of her right ear. Opinion of concerned Doctor in this regard is Ex C62. Fact of the matter is that there is no evidence of complainant on file to reflect that she has suffered any permanent functional disability. In her own cross-examination as CW1 she admitted that after marriage with CW2 she is not serving anywhere. Hence, it is not proved on file by her that due to any functional disability she would be 10 suffering incapacity to earn. There is no proof either on file if she has engaged any maid much less on monthly expenses of Rs. 4,000/-. Neither name of such maid nor proof of any payment to her is part of record. However, statement of Dr. Ketal Gupta CW7 shows that due to suffering of abovesaid injuries the claimant is unable to lead a normal life. She is incapacitated. Permanent pipe from her head to stomach has been inserted which even is visible from outside. Twice she underwent surgeries. Her intellectual capacity has been affected and she intermittently suffers fits of unconsciousness. All these circumstances reflect her precarious state of health and obviously she would be needing special diet (as is also stated about by CW7) and further medical check up and would be on medicine for rest of her life. She, therefore,would be needing help to attend her needs. Keeping in view all these circumstances, she is granted Rs.1,00,000/- for her suffering the continuous pain and agony; Rs.20,000/- on account of special diet, attendant charges and transportation; when she is just of 28 years of age, she is granted Rs.40,000/- for loss of enjoyment of life. She also is granted Rs.10,000/- for expenses on account of future medicines. 14. It has also come in the evidence of claimant party that she remained hospitalized between 13.9.2014 and 29.9.2014; then from 21.10.2014 till 23.10.2014 and lastly from 13.11.2014 to 15.11.2014. This period is of about 22 days which is rounded off as one month. Claimant has claimed in petition her income as Rs. 15,000/- per month but has examined CW6 Gurdeep Singh from her previous employer i.e Max 11 Arthur Macauliffe Public School, Samrala as per whom, and also as per detail Ex C60, the average income of claimant had been Rs.6900/- per month. She admitted in cross-examination as CW1 that after her marriage (taken place on 12.5.2014) she is not serving anywhere. Her monthly income by way of approximation and by rounding off the abovesaid amount is taken as Rs. 7,000/- to which extent she is found entitled to be compensated by respondents on account of loss of income. 15.Both these issues accordingly are deciding in favour of claimant holding that respondents are jointly and severely liable to pay her total compensation of Rs.5,44,365 /-. ISSUES NO.3 AND 4: 16.In view of my findings on issues No.1 and 2 and when claimant had suffered injuries in a Motor Vehicular Accident, she had cause of action to file this petition which petition is not shown by respondent No.3 to be bad for non-joinder of any necessary party. These issues are decided against the respondent No.3 and in favour of claimant. ISSUE NO.5 (RELIEF) 17.In the sequel to my findings under aforesaid issues, this claim petition succeeds and the same is hereby allowed with costs. The total compensation amount of Rs.5,44,365/-is held liable to be paid by respondents no.1 to 3, jointly and severally, to claimant. The claimant also will be entitled to pendente lite and future interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum on the awarded amount, as per Judgment 'Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation Limited V. S.Raja Priya 2005(3) A.C.J.1441' 12 , from the date of filing of this petition till the date of actual realization of the amount. Since respondent no.3 being insurance company vide Ex C54 (Ex R1) had agreed to indemnify respondent no.1 against all claims, as such,the respondent no.3 National Insurance Co. shall meet the liability by payment of the abovesaid amount to claimant. However, when driver respondent No.2 has been found to be without any valid driving licence on the date of occurrence, the insurance company respondent No.3 can recover the abovesaid amount from the insured respondent No.1 as per rules. 18.Counsel fee is assessed at Rs.1100/-. Memo of costs be prepared. File be consigned to the Record Room. Pronounced in open Court. (Rajeev.K.Beri) Dated: 9.1.2018 Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ludhiana (UID No.PB-0149).

AWARD 1. The present claim petition has been filed by claimants for grant of compensation to the tune of Rs.40 lac under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act against the respondents on account of death of Amrinder Singh in road side accident. 2.The claimants in a claim petition averred that on 25.7.2015, 2 Lovepreet Kaur Vs. Tinku Chouhan the deceased alongwith his father were going from their village to their fields situated at Machhiwara Road, Bhagpur on motorcycle No.PB- 10DH-9222 being driven by the deceased. They were going on a very slow speed and on the correct side of the road. At about 7.40 P.M.,when they reached in the area of village Bhagpur then a Trolla beaering registration no.Pb-06F-6749 came from opposite direction on a very high speed in a rash and negligent manner being driven by respondent no.1, who struck the Trolla against the motorcycle of the deceased and his father while driving the Trolla to its extreme wrong directions. Due that deceased and his father fell down on the road alongwith motorcycle and suffered multiple grievous injuries and were brought to Apollo hospital, Ludhiana where Amrinder Singh declared dead after treatment. The motorcycle of the deceased was complete damaged in the accident. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 who caused the accident while driving the Trolla rashly and negligently and accordingly the claimants in the present claim petition prayed for the grant of compensation in the sum of Rs. 40 lac in favour of the claimants and against respondents jointly and severally. 3.Upon notice respondents no. 1 and 2 appeared and filed written statement preliminary objections that the claim petition is not maintainable.

As per the evidence of PW1, PW2 and documentary evidence i.e., FIR Ex.P1, postmortem report of deceased Amrinder Singh Ex.PX, it has been duly proved on record that on 25.7.2015 deceased Amrinder Singh alongwith his father PW1 Surjit Singh claimant were going from their village to their field situated at Machhiwara Road Bhagpur on motorcycle No.PB-10DH-9222 driven by deceased and when they were on their correct side at about 7.40 P.M.,reached near Bhagpur then one trolla No.PB-06F-6749 came from opposite direction in a very high speed in a rash and negligent manner driven by respondent no.1 who struck the trolla against the motorcycle of the deceased while driving the Trolla to its extreme wrong side and due to which Amrinder Singh suffered multiple grievous injuries and brought the Apolo hospital where Amrinder Singh declared dead. Hence the accident took place due to rash and negligent act of driving of respondent no.1 causing the death of Amrinder Singh. The fact of accident due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 has been proved by claimants in which death of Amrinder Singh was caused. However respondent no.1 and 2 while filing the written statement have denied the accident and respondent no.3 during filing written statement in para no.8 and 24 it has 6 Lovepreet Kaur Vs. Tinku Chouhan been admitted that by submitting that the accident took place due to negligence of the driver of the motorcycle. Hence accident of motorcycle of the deceased which was driven by deceased with the offending Trolla driven by respondent no.1 has been admitted by respondent no.3 but remained failed to prove that the accident took place due to rash and negligent act of driving of deceased Amrinder Singh. Further during cross-examination of PW1 and PW2 nothing came in favour of the respondents by which it may be shown that the accident was not taken place due to rash and negligent act of driving by the respondent no.1 by driving the offending vehicle. Respondent no.1 and 2 never turned up in the witness box to deny the accident despite appearance and ultimately both were proceeded against exparte vide order dated 15.5.2018 for which adverse inference is liable to be drawn against the respondent no.1. Respondent no.3 also remained failed to prove that accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of deceased Amrinder Singh. 10.Moreover it is settled law that the cause of accident can be best explained by driver concerned and if he kept away from the witness box without sound reasons it must indeed be construed as a telling circumstance against the respondents and negligence of driver adverse inference who does not come forward to deny his negligence is liable to be drawn in favour of the claimants and against the respondents and driver is presumed to be negligent and to support this opinion this Tribunal has relied upon the citation Bhagwani Devi Vs. Krishan Kumar Saini and others 1986 KCJ 331 and Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in case titled as Raju and others Vs. 7 Lovepreet Kaur Vs. Tinku Chouhan Sukhwinder and others 2006(4) RCR(Civil) 82 , Krishana Vs.Tara Wati and others 2011(3) PLR,29. Hence respondent no.1 driver of the offending vehicle is held liable for causing the death of Amrinder Singh with the Trolla owned by respondent no.2 and accordingly issue no.1 is decided against the respondent no.1 and in favour of claimants. ISSUE NO.2 11.Onus to prove the issue no.2 was upon the claimants and in order to prove the issue no.2 claimant no.4 himself examined as PW1 and claimant no.1 Lovepreet Kaur also examined herself as PW2 vide tendering their affidavits Ex.PA, and PB. There is no dispute regarding the LRS of deceased Amrinder Singh who are claimants i.e.,claimant no.1 wife, claimant no.2 minor son, claimant no.3 mother and claimant no.4 father of the deceased Amrinder Singh. No rebuttal regarding this fact has been brought on record by the respondents. Hence claimants are the only LRS of the deceased Amrinder Singh. Further as this Tribunal has already held respondent no.1 negligent for causing the death of Amrinder Singh by driving his Trolla PB-06F-6749 and accordingly claimants are entitled to receive compensation and now the question is to be decided how much amount of compensation claimants are entitled and from which of the respondent and to decide this question, evidence on record and settled provisions of law are required to be discussed here. 12. However claimant no.1 being widow of Amrinder Singh deceased and claimant no.2 minor son of deceased Amrinder Singh, claimant no.3 and 4 parents of deceased of Amrinder Singh have been proved to be dependent on the income of the deceased Amrinder Singh 8 Lovepreet Kaur Vs. Tinku Chouhan who was working as teacher in Nankana Sahib Senior Secondary School Budhewal, through Mexus Education Pvt.Ltd.,and earning per month income Rs.7972/- and to prove this fact claimants have proved document Ex.P11. Claimants also proved on record that in addition to above work of teaching by the deceased he was also doing the agriculture and managing the agriculture land and to prove this fact claimants have proved on record the sale of the agriculture produce as per J-form Ex.P2 to Ex.P9 from the year 2012-2014. On calculation per annum average sale of agriculture produce came out to be Rs.2,40,000/- i.e.,20,000/- per month. In the opinion of this Tribunal if the deceased was also agriculturist and in case of death of an agriculturist the land is always inherited by his Lrs. Accordingly only the value of his managerial services to manage the agricultural land is to be taken into consideration and entire value of agriculture produce to determine the income of deceased cannot be considered. Hence accordingly in view of above referred facts and evidence and circumstances Rs.5000/- per month would be appropriate and justified to be considered as value/income of his managerial services to manage the agriculture land by the deceased at or before the death of the deceased in accident. Hence per month income of the deceased on calculation is held 7972 + 5000 = Rs.12972/- per month. Further in case deceased was self employed then an addition of 40% of the established income should be warranted for the purpose of future prospect when the deceased was below the age of 40 years and accordingly 40% addition of established income as referred above of the income of deceased is liable to be added as a future prospect in the income of deceased. This Tribunal 9 Lovepreet Kaur Vs. Tinku Chouhan has found that as per the postmortem Ex.PX and during cross examination of Lovepreet Kaur PW2 she admitted that date of birth of deceased Amrinder Singh as 22.10.1985 and date of death in accident of the deceased Amrinder Singh is 25.7.2015 he was aged of 30 years and accordingly age of deceased Amrinder Singh at the time of death in accident was 30 years which is neither disputed nor rebutted by the respondents. Further claimant no.1 is wife and claimant no.2 is minor son of deceased Amrinder Singh and claimants no.3 and 4 are parents of deceased and they are LRS and dependent on Amrinder Singh deceased who were living with the deceased jointly. Where the number of dependent family members of deceased are 4 then a deduction from the income of deceased i.e.,1/4 must be considered while deducting from the income of the deceased as personal and living expenses of the deceased. Further while granting compensation to the LRS appropriate selection of multiplier is required to be applied with reference of the age of the deceased for the purpose of computing the compensation amount. In case a person died in the age group between 26 to 30 years multiplier of 17 should be applied. Accordingly keeping in view of the age of deceased Amrinder Singh 30 years multiplier of 17 is applied. To support above opinion this Tribunal has relied upon the citation Smt.Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another 2009(3) RCR(Civil),77 Supreme Court. This Tribunal is further of the opinion that due to death of Amrinder Singh, his wife claimant no.1 is entitled to receive compensation Rs.40,000/- as consortium and further minor son of deceased is also entitled to receive compensation Rs.15,000/- for loss of 10 Lovepreet Kaur Vs. Tinku Chouhan love, affection, care and guidance and further claimants are also entitled to compensation of Rs.15,000/- as funeral expenses which would have been definitely incurred by the claimants at the time of cremation of deceased Amrinder Singh and to support this opinion this Tribunal has relied upon the citation National Insurance Company Ltd.,Vs. Pranay Sethi and others 2017(4) RCR (Civil),1009 Supreme Court. Hence in view of the above discussion claimants are entitled to compensation amount receivable by the claimants has been calculated as follow:- Sr. No. Head Calculation 1. Income Rs.12,972/- per month 2. 40% of no.1 above to be added as future prospectRs.12972+5188.8 i.e.,40% = Rs.18,160.8/- per month 3. ¼ of above deducted as personal and living expenses of the deceasedRs.18160.8 – 4540.2 i.e.,1/4 = Rs.13620.6/- per month 4. Compensation after multiplier of 17 is appliedRs.13620.6 x 12 x17 = Rs.27,78,602.4/- 5. a) Loss of consortium to wife b) loss of love, affection, care and guidance of sona)Rs.40,000/- to claimant no.1 b) Rs.15,000 to claimant no.2 6. Funeral expenses Rs.15,000/- 7. cost of petition assessed Rs.3000/- Total compensation amount 28,51,602.4/- 13. As this Tribunal has already held that the claimants are entitled to receive the compensation amount as assessed above and now the question is to be decided from which of the respondents the claimants are entitled to receive the compensation amount and for this answer this Tribunal is of the opinion that as the offending vehicle i.e.,Trolla of 11 Lovepreet Kaur Vs. Tinku Chouhan respondent no.1 owned by respondent no.2 was having validly insured with the insurance company i.e.,respondent no.3 vide insurance policy Ex.R8. However validity of insurance Ex.R8 has been disputed by the respondent no.3 on the ground that the cheque no.260 dated 7.7.2015 was dishonoured due to insufficient fund which was issued by owner of the offending vehicle respondent no.2 Jiwanjoti of Rs.22739/-and regarding cheque bouncing memo was obtained from the bank and letter Ex.R2 dated 17.7.2015 regarding cancellation of insurance policy was issued to the Regional Transport officer Guardaspur as well as letter Ex.R3 dated 17.7.2015 to respondent no.2 Jiwanjoti owner of the offending vehicle and to support this contention respondent examined witness RW1 Amandeep Singh Manager(legal) of the company who tendered affidavit Ex.RA and brought on record documents Ex.R1 to Ex.R8. During cross examination this witness has admitted that he joined the office in September 2015, and it is correct that the policy is prior to his joining and it is also correct that there are officers who are working since January 2015 and these officers can appear in the court as they are hail and hearty. Meaning thereby neither the insurance policy was issued in his presence nor he joined the office of insurance company respondent no.3 before the date of accident in this case dated 25.7.2015 and the officers in whose knowledge who were working at the office of respondent no.3 to brought on record the material facts regarding this policy have been withheld and not stepped into witness box to claim that the insurance policy was cancelled and intimation was sent to owner and Registering Authority of the offending vehicle. Further during cross-examination RW1 admitted 12 Lovepreet Kaur Vs. Tinku Chouhan that he do not know if the dispatch register is maintained or not but the same is dealt with different team. Ex.R2 bear the reference number but not the dispatch number and same is his reply regarding the Ex.R3. He further admitted that he cannot say if Ex.R2 is sent through courier or registered post he has not brought the receipt of the same. Hence admittedly no dispatch register or record has been brought on record by the respondent no.3 or any registered postal receipt or any courier receipt or any other mode of communication by which it may be proved or shown that Ex.R2 and R3 regarding the cancellation of insurance policy were conveyed before the date of accident. Mere producing the copies of Ex.R2 and R3 by retaining themselves itself does not prove that the same letters were sent to the respondent no.2 and Registering Authority of the vehicle of respondent no.2 in the absence of any proof of communication. Hence from the documents relied upon by the respondent no.3 through RW1 it is not proved or established that insurance policy was cancelled and said information was sent to the respondent no.2 and Registering Authority rather from the insurance policy Ex.R8 which is admitted it has been proved that the valid insurance policy was in existence regarding the offending vehicle of respondent no.2 driven by respondent no.1 insured with respondent no.3. Further respondent no.3 even remained failed to produce on record till date photo copy of any postal receipt, courier receipt and dispatch register or any other mode of communication since the appearance before this Tribunal or at the time of filing the written statement and thereafter till date. If it is so, then this Tribunal is bound to infer that there was no proof of sending the information i.e.,Ex.R2 and R3 13 Lovepreet Kaur Vs. Tinku Chouhan by the respondent no.3 to respondent no.2 and Registering authority of the vehicle of respondent no.2 and these are only created documents by respondent no.3 to support their plea and to frustrate the claim of claimant. Hence it is held that insurance policy Ex.R8 was valid at the time of accident which was valid from 7.7.2015 to 7.7.2016. Accordingly contention of respondent no.3 are without any force and same are discarded. Further validity of the ownership of the offending vehicle with the respondent no.2 is not disputed by the respondent no.1 rather he himself produced on record photo copy of the RC which showing the ownership of the offending Trolla on the name of Jiwanjoti respondent no.2. However nothing brought on record regarding the route permit and fitness certificate of the offending vehicle by the respondent no.2. Further respondent no.1 also remained failed to produce on record any valid driving licence to drive the offending Trolla at the time of accident. Hence it is proved on record that respondent no.2 is owner of offending vehicle and respondent no.1 was driving the said vehicle and said offending vehicle was insured with the insurance company respondent no.3 and respondent no.1 was not having valid driving licence and respondent no.2 was not having valid route permit and fitness certificate of the offending vehicle. Accordingly all the respondents are held jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation amount to the claimants. Accordingly first liability to pay the compensation amount is of the respondent no.3 with whom offending vehicle driven by respondent no.1 owned by respondent no.2 was insured and thus respondent no.3 is held liable to pay compensation amount to the claimants. However respondents no.3 is set 14 Lovepreet Kaur Vs. Tinku Chouhan at liberty to recover the compensation amount if paid to the claimants by giving respondent no.3 the rights of the recovery of same amount as per law from the respondents no.1 and 2 for which respondents no.1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable. Hence issue no.2 is decided in favour of claimants and against respondents. ISSUE NO.3 14. Onus to prove the issue no.3 was on the respondent no.l for which respondent remained fail to prove the same because earlier despite appearance he failed to produce on record any copy of driving licence and ultimately vide order dated 15.5.2018 proceeded against exparte and in this manner he intentionally avoid to pursue the case for which adverse inference is liable to be drawn against respondent no.1. Moreover, in view of the above discussion in issue no.2 it has already been held that respondent no.1 was not having valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident and accordingly issue no.3 is decided in favour of the respondent no.3 and against the respondent no.1. ISSUE NO.4 15.Onus to prove this issues no.4 was on the respondent no.2 and remained fail to prove the same because earlier despite appearance he failed to produce on record any copy of route permit and fitness certificate of the offending vehicle and ultimately vide order dated 15.5.2018 proceeded against exparte and in this manner she intentionally avoid to pursue the case for which adverse inference is liable to be drawn against respondent no.2 and it is already held by this Tribunal that respondent no.2 was having valid RC but no fitness certificate and route permit has 15 Lovepreet Kaur Vs. Tinku Chouhan been produced on record. Hence accordingly issue no.4 is partly decided in favour of the respondent no.2 and partly against the respondent no.2 and partly in favour of respondent no.3 and partly against respondent no.3. ISSUE NO.5 16.Onus to prove the issue no.5 was upon the respondents for which they remained fail to show that how and why present claim petition is not maintainable when the deceased Amrinder Singh died in accident due to rash and negligent act of driving by respondent no.1 by driving offending vehicle owned by respondent no.2 insured with respondent no.3 and accordingly claimants are LR of the deceased and present claim petition is duly maintainable and accordingly issue no.5 is decided in favour of claimants and against the respondents. Relief. 17.In view of findings on the above said issues, the claim petition in hand succeeds and award of Rs. 28,51,602.4/- with costs is passed in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. The aforesaid compensation amount shall be apportioned among the claimants as under: 1) Lovepreet Kaur (wife) :Rs.10,51,602.4/- 2) Prabhsimran Singh(son) :Rs.10 lac 3) Jaswant Kaur(mother) :Rs.4 lac 4) Surjit Singh(father) :Rs.4 lac It is further directed that the claimants are entitled to receive the compensation amount as assessed above @ 6% per annum from the date of filing of claim petition till the date of award and the respondents shall 16 Lovepreet Kaur Vs.

New India Assurance Company Ltd. … ..Respondents Claim Petition under section 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act, as amended upto date. Present: Sh. J.K. Kapila, Adv. Counsel for the Claimants. 12 Sh. DR Rampal, Adv. Counsel for the respondent no.3. Respondents no.1 and 2 exparte. A W AR D The claimants Sunita Makol and others, have filed the present claim petition under section 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act, for grant of compensation, on account of death of Satpal Makol, in a motor vehicle Act. 2. The facts in brief, necessary for the disposal of the present claim petition, are that on 12.6.2015, the respondent no.1 was on the wheels of Tanker No.GJ-12AT-5251. The tanker was loaded with Amonia gas. The respondent no.1 was coming towards Ludhiana side and he was driving the said tanker in a very rash and negligent manner. When he was passing under the Doraha Canal bridge, he did not care for the height of the bridge and he continued driving recklessly and in a rash and negligent manner and in the process, he tried to pass under the bridge without caring for the fact that it was not possible to cross under path of such bridge on account of which, the upper portion of the tanker struck against the bridge on account of which the lid of the tanker was broken and there was severe leakage of Amonia gas from the tanker, which resulted in adverse effect on all the persons who were passing near the bridge and due to impact of the Amonia Gas, Sh. Satpal Makol since deceased who had opened the shutter of his shop to save the employees in the shop, on account of which he had also adverse impact of Amonia Gas and he got engulfed with Amonia gas, as a result of which he fell unconscious, he was taken to the hospital where he 12 succumbed on account of adverse effect of Amonia gas. Sh. Satpal Makol died on account of rash and negligent driving of the Tanker No.GJ-AT-5251 by respondent no.1. As there was direct nexus between the accident caused by respondent no.1 while driving the said tanker rashly and negligently and consequently struck against the bridge, which resulted in breaking of lid of the tanker, which further resulted in the leakage of Amonia case,the deceased Satpal Makol died on account of rash and negligent driving of the vehicle by the respondent no.1, which caused accidental death of Satpal Makot. The claimant no.1 is widow of deceased Satpal Makol and claimant no.2 is the son of deceased. The deceased was 60 years old at the time of his death. He was doing the Sweets business under the name and style of M/s Lovely Sweets, Railway Road, Doraha and was earning Rs.80,000/- per month. His business was flourishing day by day and his income was to increase manifold within a span of 2/3 years and he would have started earning Rs.1,00,000/- per month in the coming three years On account of said accident, the claimant no.1 has lost her life companion and the claimant no.2 has lost his father at such a young age and prayed for grant of compensation to the extent of Rs.80,00,000/-. Hence the petition. 3. Upon notice, the respondents no.1 and 2 did not appear and were proceeded against exparte. Respondent no.3 appeared through counsel and filed written statement that the claim petition is not drafted in accordance with the rules of Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court and Motor Vehicle Act and same is also not verified in 12 accordance with the provisions of Order 6 Rule 15 CPC and same is not maintainable in the present form. The claim petition is bad for non joinder and mis joinder of necessary parties and on this score alone, when all the necessary parties have not been impleaded, the claim petition is liable to be dismissed. The claimants have not suffered the loss of any kind. The claimant no.2 is major son of deceased and is earning handsome amount and was not dependent upon the deceased. The claimants are stopped by their act and conduct from filing claim petition. The respondent no.1 was not possessing valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident and was also not driving tanker no.GJ-12AT-5251, in the course of his employment with the owner and insured of the vehicle and has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and also breached the provisions of MV Act. The insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation. The tanker no.GJ-12AT-5251 was not having valid registration certificate, permit and fitness certificate at the time of alleged accident and was being driven against the terms and conditions of insurance policy and in violation of Motor Vehicle Act. The owner and insured of the vehicle were fully aware that respondent no.1 did not possess valid and effective driving licence and they did not take due precaution and reasonable care and as such the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. No liability can be fastened on the answering respondent. The answering respondent takes all the defences available under sections 147,149,157,170 of the Motor Vehicle Act and reserves 12 its right to file an amended written statement and additional written statement on disclosure of new facts. The vehicle stated to be insured with the answering respondent should comply with the provisions of section 64 VB of Insurance Act, 1938. The answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation as demanded in the claim petition. If at all, the tribunal held that case of the claimants is fully established and proved and answering respondent is liable to pay compensation then sufficient time may kindly be granted to deposit the award amount without any interest. As per verdict of Hon'ble Supreme court, the interest awarded on compensation amount should be inconformity with the prevailing bank rate of interest as on long term fixed deposits. The bank rate of interest on long terms fix deposit is below 6%. On merits, it is submitted that no accident took place as alleged. The amount demanded is too much exaggerated and arbitrary one and no explanation was given for alleged demand. Deceased was not doing any job and was leading retired life. The claimants were not dependent upon the deceased and they have not suffered the loss of any kind. Even if any business which was being going on before the death of deceased, that business has been acquired by the claimants after the death and as such, the claimants have not suffered any alleged loss. Denying all the averments as made in the claim petition and reiterating the averments as made in the preliminary objections, prayed for dismissal of the claim petition. 4. From the pleading of the parties, following issues are 12 framed: A. Whether deceased Satpal has died, due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1 Jatinder Singh while driving the tanker no.GJ-12AT-5251, rashly and negligently?OPA B. Whether the claimants are entitled to compensation on account of death of Sukhjinder Singh? If so, as to what amount and from whom?OPA C. Relief In order to prove the case, the claimants examined CW-1 Sunita Makol, CW-2 Varinder Sharma, CW-3 Rohit and thereafter counsel for the claimants closed the evidence. Thereafter counsel for the respondent no.3 tendered into evidence the documents Ex.R.1 to Ex.R.9 and closed the evidence of the respondent no.3. 5. I have heard the ld. Counsel for the claimants and respondent no.3 and have gone through the file very carefully. My issue wise findings are as under: Issue No.A 6. The present claim petition has been filed by the claimants alleging that Satpal Makol, aged about 60 years died due to rash and negligent act of the respondent no.1, who was driving the Tanker bearing no. GJ-12AT-5251, on 12.6.2015, which was containing Amonia gas. The tanker was being driven rashly and negligently when it was passing through the Doraha Canal bridge, without taking the care 12 of height of the bridge, the driver entered the truck below the bridge due to which tanker struck with the roof of the bridge and amonia gas started leaking. Due to the leakage of the gas, the amonia gas engulfed the area and Satpal Makol, who was running sweet shop in the name of M/s Lovely Sweets, Doraha and Satpal Makol has died. In order to prove this, the claimants have examined CW-1 Sunita Makol and CW-2 Varinder Sharma and has proved on the file FIR Ex.P.X, registerd against the driver of the tanker bearing no.GJ-12AT-5251 and copy of the charge framed against the accused/respondent Jatinder Singh as Ex.P.2. No evidence to rebut the evidence of the claimants was produced by the respondents. It is well settled principal of law that registration of FIR is a strong circumstance that the accident has taken place due to rash and negligent driving of the driver. Reference in this regard can be made to the law laid down in Girdhari Lal vs Radhey Sham 1993(2) PLR, Page 109. In this case, even the charge sheet against the accused has been framed by the court. The driver of the truck has not come present to prove that the accident has not taken place due to his rash and negligent driving. He is the best witness to disclose the mode of accident. The non-appearance of the driver in the witness box goes against the respondents. Thus, it is established that the accident has taken place due to rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1 while driving the tanker bearing no. GJ-12AT-5251. Hence, this issue is decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. Issue No.B 12 7. The claimants are the wife and son of the deceased Satpal. Counsel for the respondent insurance company has argued that the claimant no.2 Vineet Makol is the major son, so he is not entitled to any compensation as he is not dependent upon the income of the deceased. But, I do not agree with this contention of the Ld. Counsel for the respondent. Being the legal representative, he is entitled to compensation. It is irrelevant whether the claimants are sons and duaghters, who are major and are dependent on the father and mother. Reference in this regard can be made to the law laid down in Mothu Singh and others, Appellants vs. Kewalpreet Singh and others, Respondents,2016(5) RCR(civil) 984 . So, even if Vaneet Makol claimant no.2 is major, even then he is entitled to compensation for the death of his father Satpal Makol. Sunita Makol is wife, who was dependent upon the deceased, so both the claimants are entitled to compensation. 8. Now comes the question, as to what amount of compensation, the claimants are entitled. There is no dispute that deceased was aged about 60 years. This fact is also apparent from the postmortem report Ex.P.Y. The claimant Sunita Makol who has appeared as CW-1 has stated that deceased Satpal Makol was running a sweet shop in the name of M/s Lovely Sweets, Doraha and earning more than Rs.80,000/- per month. The claimants have further examined CW-3 Rohit, Tax Assistant, Income Tax Department, who has proved income tax of Satpal Makol for the year 2013-14, 2014-15, 2015-16 12 Ex.C1 to Ex.C3 and perusal of this income tax return reveals that in the last return for the assessment year 2015-16, the total income of the deceased was mentioned as Rs.4,81,642/- i.e. Rs. 40,000/- per month. Even though oral evidence has been led by the claimants that earning of the deceased was 80,000/- per month, but keeping in view the income tax return Ex.C.1 to Ex.C.3, the monthly income of the deceased Satpal Makol is assessed as Rs.40,000/- per month. There are three persons in the family, so 1/3rd of this income, is to be deducted towards the personal expenses of Satpal Makol. The yearly dependency of the claimant per year comes out to be Rs.3,20,000/- by deducting Rs.1,60,000/- as personal expenses of the deceased Satpal Makol. The age of the deceased was 60 years. So, multiplier of 7 is to be applied. The total compensation comes out to be Rs. 22,40,000/-. Apart from this, Sunita Makol is entitled to Rs.1,00,000/- for the loss of consortium and Vineet Makol is entitled to Rs.1,00,000/-, due to loss of love and affection on account of death of his father and Rs.25,000/- is to be paid towards funeral expenses. The total compensation, which the claimants are entitled comes to Rs.24,65,000/-. 9. Now comes the question, who has to pay this amount. There is no dispute that the vehicle was insured with the respondent no.3 insurance company. The counsel for the respondent no.3 insurance company while relying upon the Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991 has submitted that vehicle was not insured for carrying the inflammable or dangerous material. So, the insurance company is not liable to re- 12 imburse the respondents no.1 and 2 on account of the accident, resulting into the death of the Satpal Makol. He has submitted that for the carrying of the hazardous substances separate policy is to be obtained. But, I do not agree with this contention of the Ld. Counsel for the respondent. Once the vehicle has been insured, the insurance company is liable to pay if any incident has taken place. In this regard, reference can be made to the law laid down in New India Assurance Co. Ltd., Appellant vs. Biman Prasad Barkakati and others,2009 ACJ 974, United India Insurance Co. Ltd., vs. Janki Devi and others, 2013 ACJ 1509. In both the above judgments, it has been categorically laid down by the Hon'ble High Court of Gauhati and Rajasthan High Court, if the offending vehicle was carrying an inflammable and hazardous substance at the time of accident and accident has taken place, the insurance company is liable to pay the compensation. So, in view of the above proposition of law, it is the respondent no.3, who has to pay the compensation. So, this issue is decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondent no.3. Relief 10. In view of my findings on the aforementioned issues, the claim petition succeeds and the same is allowed with costs and award of Rs.24,65,000/-(Rs. Twenty Four Lacs and Sixty Five Thousand only) is passed in favour of the claimants against the respondents alongwith pendentelite and future interest at the rate of 7.50% per annum on the award amount from the date of institution of claim petition till 12 realization. The compensation amount is to be shared to extent of 60% by claimant no.1 and 40% by claimant no.2. As per latest decision in Civil Revision No. 7407 of 2010 dated 3-6-2011 of the Hon'ble High Court in the case of_ Jyoti Boormi versus Anu Sandeep Boormi, now it is desirable that if the claimants have any account in bank then they will intimate to this court within one month from the date of receipt of certified copy of the judgment and then by way of notice to the respondents after the receipt of certified copy of judgment. The claimants are also ordered to furnish indemnity bonds within period of 3 months in the court to indemnify the better claimant or in case of appeal is decided against them. After the compliance, respondents are ordered to pay the award amount directly in the account of the claimant by RTGS or by way of draft or cross cheque in the name of the claimants, so that cumbersome procedure of deposit and withdrawal from the court could be avoided by both the parties to save their time as well as time of the court. Counsel fee is assessed Rs.2500/-.Memo of costs be prepared. File be consigned to the record room after due compliance.

Claim Petition under Section 166 of The Motor Vehicles Act,1988. -00- Present:Shri Sumit Jain, Advocate, for claimant. Respondents No.1 and 2 exparte. Shri Vyom Bansal, Advocate, for respondent no.3. AWARD This petition, under Section 166 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 has been filed by claimant seeking compensation from respondents no.1 2 to 3 on account of suffering of injuries by him in a motor vehicular accident on 13.9.2014 caused by respondent No.2 by driving Canter bearing No. HR-55-Q-8307 in a rash and negligent manner near the bridge opposite to Village Mandyala Kalan, Distt.Ludhiana. He averred in the petition that he is just 31 years old and is Auction Recorder with Market Committee, Machhiwara, Distt. Ludhiana. His monthly income is Rs. 29,680/-. On 13.9.2014 he and his wife Ramandeep Kaur were on their Honda Activa scooter bearing No. PB-26-E-1056 and were coming from Khanna, Distt. Ludhiana side to Manji Sahib Kota Gurudwara to pay obeisance. Maternal uncle of his wife namely Gurcharan Singh resident of Kotla Ajner, Tehsil Khamano, Distt. Fatehgarh Sahib had come to visit them at Khanna. He also was going with them to the said Gurdawara Sahib on motorcycle No. PB-23-N-7936. Claimant was driving the abovesaid Activa Scooter whereas his wife was sitting pillion on it. He was driving the same at a slow speed and by following all the traffic rules. At about 1.30 PM they reached near bridge of Village Mandyala Kalan, Distt. Ludhiana. By then a Canter bearing registration No. HR-55-Q-8307 came from behind which was being driven by respondent No.2 recklessly, without blowing horn and in a negligent manner. It collided into the Honda Activa Scooter of claimant party. The claimant and his wife fell on the road and suffered multiple grievous injuries. Said scooter also was damaged. The Canter driver fled away in that vehicle. Both the injured were removed by Gurcharan Singh to Kular Hospital, Bija and since their condition was critical, they were referred to Satguru Partap Singh Apollo 3 Hospital, Ludhiana. Due to this occurrence the eyewitness Gurcharan Singh had got lodged FIR No.163 dated 15.9.2014 under sections 279,337,338,427 IPC with P.S.Sadar, Khanna. Claimant had suffered multiple grievous injuries on his body. He was found to have massive haemoperitoneum along with Splemic Hepatic, IVC and small BOWEL mesenteric injuries. He underwent Splenectomy, Jejunal Segmental resection, IVC repair and colonic serosal tear repair. He was discharged on 5.10.2014. On such treatment he spent Rs.8,96,147/-. He was again admitted on 11.10.2014 on account of Acute Febrile/illness for 2-3 days post laprotomy and Splenectomy and was discharged on 13.10.2014. He spent Rs.14,519/- on this treatment. Again he was admitted on 25.11.2014 and Urethral dilatation was done on 25.11.2014. He was discharged on 26.11.2014. He spent Rs. 43,024/-. Due to urinary problem, claimant has to place Folly Catheter (long tube) in urethra from time to time which is a painful procedure. Due to such injuries and treatment the life of the claimant has become miserable. He cannot lead normal life. His working capacity has been affected and he has suffered huge and agony. The involved canter is owned by respondent No.1 and was insured with respondent No.3.. Hence, the petition whereby claimant has prayed for compensation of Rs. 50 lakhs with interest. 3.Due notice of petition was given to the respondents. However, the owner and driver of above referred Canter i.e respondents No.1 and 2 preferred not to appear. They were treated exparte. Respondent No.3 filed its written statement wherein the entire version of 4 claim petition was controverted. It was denied if this respondent was liable to pay compensation to claimant. As per this respondent the driver and owner of offending vehicle had not complied with the terms and conditions of insurance policy and that t he current petition is not maintainable and also is bad for non-joinder of necessary parties. With such averments, respondent No.3 prayed for dismissal of claim petition. 4.On such pleadings, following issues were framed on 18.11.2015: 1.Whether the claimant suffered injuries on account of the accident took place on 13.9.2014 on account of the motor vehicle accident caused by respondent No.1(2) while driving an offending vehicle Canter Truck bearing N. HR-55-Q-8307 in a rash and negligent manner?OPP. 2.If issue No.1 is proved in affirmative, whether the claimant is entitled to recover the compensation, if so, from which of the respondents and to what amount?OPP. 3.Whether there is no cause for filing the present claim petition?OPR 4.Whether the present petition is bad for non-joinder of necessary parties?OPR 5.Relief. 5.To prove his version claimant firstly himself deposed as CW1 and also examined eyewitness Gurcharan Singh as CW2; Gurmail Singh, Accountant from Market Committee, Machhiwara, Distt. Ludhiana as CW3; HC Mohinder Singh as CW4; Dr. Vikas Kumar from SPS Apollo Hospital, Ludhiana as CW5; Dr. Harpreet Singh from same Hospital as 5 CW6, tendered documents Ex C91 to EX C177 and thereafter closed his evidence. 6.Respondent No.3 tendered copy of insurance policy of offending vehicle as Ex R1, reports of licencing authority Kolkata as Ex R2 as Ex R3 and closed its evidence. 7.I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record . My issue-wise findings are as under:- ISSUES NO.1 AND 2. 8.Both these issues are interconnected, and, therefore, are being taken up together for disposal to avoid repetition of discussion. 9.To prove these issues, claimant has examined above noted 6 C.Ws. He himself has deposed as CW1 while the eyewitness and author of FIR of involved incident i.e Gurcharan Singh has deposed as CW2. Their examinations-in-chief are verbatim repetition of version in the petition about as to how the alleged incident took place whereby the above referred Honda Activa Scooter of this CW1 was hit by the above referred Canter in the area of Village Mandlyala Kalan on 13.9.2014 at about 1.30 PM. These witnesses detailed out that at the time of such ill- fated occurrence this scooter was being driven by CW1 and his wife was sitting pillion with him on that vehicle and when they reached abovesaid place, the Canter, being driven by respondent No.2 and bearing No. HR- 55-Q-8307, came from behind which as per them was being driven rashly and negligently by respondent No.2 which caused the collision of both these vehicles throwing both scooter occupants CW1 and his wife 6 Ramandeep Kaur on the road resulting in multiple grievous injuries on their bodies. These CW1 and CW2 also stated that it was CW2 who had removed them to the Hospital and also had got lodged FIR about this occurrence, copy of which is Ex C1. Cross-examination conducted on these two C.Ws by appearing respondent No.3 Insurance Company more or less is suggestive only where nothing shattering depositions of these C.Ws came. As per these witnesses the offending Canter is owned by respondent No.1 and was insured with respondent No.3. This aspect also has gone uncontroverted in their cross-examinations. Incidentally, and importantly, the said owner and offending driver respondents No.1 and 2 have preferred not to appear and to contest the petition thereby impliedly admitting the version of these C.Ws about the occurrence having been caused by rash and negligent driving of abovesaid Canter by respondent No.2 at the given time and place. By virtue of such un-shattered depositions of CW1 and CW2, the eyewitnesses, I conclude that the claimant has established on file that it was respondent No.2, by whose rash and negligent driving of said Canter the involved occurrence had taken place causing injuries to claimant. 10.CW1 claimant also has proved on file during his deposition a copy of registration certificate (RC) of offending Canter in the name of respondent No.1 as Ex C80, copy of its insurance policy and its attending document as Ex C80 (inadvertently re-numbered) and Ex C81, copy of driving licence (DL) of respondent No.2 as Ex C82, copy of RC of ill- fated Honda Activa scooter of CW1 as Ex C83 and copy of his driving 7 licence as Ex C84. Except for document Ex C82 (DL) no other document has been disputed by contesting respondent No.3 insurance company during its evidence. It had called for the report of concerned Licencing Authority, Kolkata. Same is Ex R2 and shows that the said driving licence (Ex C82) was never issued by said Licencing Authority which brings out that the respondent No.2 did not have a valid driving licence in his name on the day of involved occurrence. On the strength of such outcome the Ld. Counsel for respondent No.3 has asserted that latter be exonerated of the liability but he failed to controvert the contention of claimant that the violation of insurance policy condition by owner/driver like respondents No.1 and 2 cannot exonerate the insurance company from its liability towards a 3rd party like the current claimant with whom this company had no privity of contract. This insurance company may seek recovery rights against respondents No.1 and 2. 11.In view of the discussion made in the preceding lines above, I conclude that the owner of offending vehicle i.e respondent No.1, its driver i.e respondent No.2 as well as the insurer of this vehicle respondent No.3 are liable to compensate claimant for the injuries suffered by him due to rash and negligent driving of above said Canter by respondent No.2. 12.With regard to bringing on file the quantum about such claim the claimant, in his deposition as CW1, has reiterated the version of petition in detail reflecting suffering of massive haemoperitoneum along with Splemic Hepatic, IVC and small BOWEL mesenteric injuries. He 8 underwent Splenectomy, Jejunal Segmental resection, IVC repair and colonic serosal tear repair. He was discharged on 5.10.2014. He also stated that he was again admitted on 11.10.2014 on account of Acute Febrile/illness for 2-3 days post laprotomy and Splenectomy. Again he admitted on 25.11.2014 and Urethral dilatation was done on 25.11.2014. He was discharged on 26.11.2014. He spent Rs. 9,53,690/- on his treatment. He had suffered segmental mandible and maxilla fracture, fracture of left transverse processes L1-L4 vertebrae (spine) and Post Traumatic Pancreatitis and, due to urinary problem, he has to place Folly Catheter (long tube) in urethra from time to time which is a painful procedure. He proved on file his medical bills and discharge summary as Ex C2 to C64 and then tendered medical bills Ex C91 to Ex C169. These bills are worth Rs.10,99,151/- However, these also include bills Ex C151 to Ex C153 (of Moga) each for Rs.16,000/- but claimant has failed to prove on record that he ever had obtained treatment from Moga. Therefore, the amount of these bills is not being added in total amount when these have remained unrelated with the invovled occurrence/injuries. The amount of remaining bills comes to Rs. 10,51,151/-.Claimant also has examined CW3 Gurmail Singh, Accountant from Market Committee, Machhiwara. This witness stated that claimant i.e CW1 is working as Mandi Supervisor with said Market Committee who had submitted his medical bills with the department for reimbursement. The bills are Ex C5 and Ex C6 respectively valued Rs. 8,96,147/- and Rs.14,519/-. This CW3 then stated that from this claimed 9 amount the department had reimbursed only Rs. 4,24,463/- to claimant and letter regarding the same is Ex C88. It means that from the claimed amount Rs. 10,51,151/-(including latest bills), the claim of reimbursement of Rs. 4,24,463/- by the Employer of claimant has already been passed in his favour. The remaining amount Rs. 6,26,688/-, therefore,is liable to be paid by respondents to claimant towards such medical expenses. 13.Claimant also has examined CW5 Dr. Vikas Kumar and CW6 Dr. Harpreet Singh. In examinations-in-chief they reiterated the entire pleadings of petition that claimant was admitted in SPS Apollo Hospital, Ludhiana on 13.9.2014 due to suffering of multiple grievous injuries in road accident. He was admitted six times because of complications. He had to undergo open urethoplasty due to urethral stricture. Due to urethral reconstruction, claimant is now unable to father a child in natural course and the couple can conceive only by artificial procedure. However, during cross-examination CW5 conceded that the claimant is leading normal life after recovering from last operation. Fact of the matter is that there is no evidence of claimant on file to reflect that he has suffered any permanent functional disability or has suffered loss of any income during treatment period or afterwards. He is in Govt. Service. Above detailed circumstances,however, show that claimant has suffered multiple physical complications and now medically cannot father a child except by way of artificial insemination. He is just 31 years old. He will be facing life long urethral problem. As per Doctor CW5 the claimant will not be able to urinate normally throughout the rent of his life and will 10 have to place foley Catheter in the urethra from time to time which is an uncomfortable and painful procedure. For these reasons he is granted Rs.50,000/- for loss of enjoyment and persistent pain and agony and Rs.10,000/- on account of special diet. He also is granted Rs.10,000/- for expenses on account of future medicines. 14. Claimant CW1 also has proved on file documents Ex C65 to Ex C79 with respect to his alleged expenditure on transportation to obtain above said medical treatment. Incidentally and astonishingly all these bills from same bill book having consecutive serial numbers from 121 to 132 and then from 134 to 137 though these are of different dates falling in the year 2014 and 2015. The period spans from 5.10.2014 till 18.8.2015. It is unbelievable that the bill book of the alleged transporter remained unused except for the purpose alleged by claimant. Then the alleged transporter has not been examined as a CW to prove these bills as authentic ones. These are discarded for being procured ones. However, as claimant is resident of Khanna and had obtained medical treatment from SPS Apollo Hospital at Ludhiana, he is given transportation charges as Rs. 10,000/-. 15.Both these issues accordingly are deciding in favour of claimant holding that respondents are jointly and severely liable to pay him total compensation of Rs.7,06,688 /-. ISSUES NO.3 AND 4: 16.In view of my findings on issues No.1 and 2 and when claimant had suffered injuries in a Motor Vehicular Accident, he had the cause of action to file this petition which petition is not shown by 11 respondent No.3 to be bad for non-joinder of any necessary party. These issues are decided against the respondent No.3 and in favour of claimant. ISSUE NO.5 (RELIEF) 17.In the sequel to my findings under aforesaid issues, this claim petition succeeds and the same is hereby allowed with costs. The total compensation amount of Rs.7,06,688/-is held liable to be paid by respondents no.1 to 3, jointly and severally, to claimant. The claimant also will be entitled to pendente lite and future interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum on the awarded amount, as per Judgment 'Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation Limited V. S.Raja Priya 2005(3) A.C.J.1441' , from the date of filing of this petition till the date of actual realization of the amount. Since respondent no.3 being insurance company vide Ex C80 (Ex R1) had agreed to indemnify respondent no.1 against all claims, as such,the respondent no.3 National Insurance Co. shall meet the liability by payment of the abovesaid amount to claimant. However, when driver respondent No.2 has been found to be without any valid driving licence on the date of occurrence, the insurance company respondent No.3 can recover the abovesaid amount from the insured respondent No.1 as per rules. 18.Counsel fee is assessed at Rs.1100/-. Memo of costs be prepared. File be consigned to the Record Room. Pronounced in open Court. (Rajeev.K.Beri) Dated: 9.1.2018 Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ludhiana (UID No.PB-0149).

Sh.Sukhchain Singh, Government Pleader for respondents no.3 and 4. ORDER 1.The above titled claim petition No.37 dated 28.05.1993 was earlier filed by the claimants on account of death of Ramesh Lal caused in the motor vehicular accident on 07.02.1993 at about 06:00 AM in the ara of Village Bhutta, due to rash and negligent driving of driver, while driving Truck No.PAT-1564 and thereafter, the State of Punjab-cum- Secretary, Home Affairs, Punjab Chandigarh and S.S.P.Police District Jagraon were made party instead of two drivers. The said claim petition Pushpa Rani vs. Sarwan Singh 10CIS.No.MACP/122/2015. was dismissed by the then Presiding Officer, Motor Accident claims Tribunal vide Award dated 21.03.1997 while deciding issue no.7 against the claimants holding that the gratuitous passenger travels in goods carrier at own risk and Ramesh Lal being not a passenger in the said truck, the claimants are not entitled to any compensation from the respondents. 2. Against the above said Award, the claimants filed FAO No.1336 of 1997 before the Hon'ble High Court , where, Hon'ble High Court observed as under:- “Ultimately, it was held that in such a case, the State would be liable to pay the compensation. In the present case, the judgment cited above is applicable on all fours. Consequently, the finding that the heirs of the deceased are not entitled to any compensation is set aside. I find that the Tribunal has not quantified the compensation payable. In the circumstances, the matter is remanded back to the Tribunal to re-decide the issue no.7:- “7. To what amount of compensation, the claimants are entitled to and from whom? For this purpose, the Tribunal will give two effective opportunities to the appellant to prove the income and the respondents will also be granted two opportunities” 3. Accordingly, in view of observations of Hon'ble High Court , process was issued to the parties and evidence of both the parties on issue no.7 was called. 4. I have heard the Ld.counsel for the parties and have gone though the record on the file carefully. My findings on issue no.7 are as under:- ISSUE NO.7 5. The onus to prove this issue was on the claimants and in order to prove this issue, claimant examined Sukhchain Singh, who Pushpa Rani vs. Sarwan Singh 10CIS.No.MACP/122/2015. tendered into evidence his affidavit Ex.CA deposing that deceased Ramesh Lal unfortunately died in a motor vehicle accident, which took place on 07.02.1993 at 06:00 AM in the area of village Bhutta, due to rash and negligent driving of Kultar Singh, who also died in the same accident. He further deposed that the deceased was working as Sub Inspector in C.R.P.F.and was drawing Rs.4500/- per month as salary. The deceased was hale and hearty and was 42 years of age at the time of his death. With the passage of time, he was likely to be promoted to the post of Commandant of CRPF and his income would have also definitely increased to the tune of more than Rs.10,000/- at that time. He further deposed that all the claimants were dependents upon the income of deceased. But due to death of deceased, the claimant no.1 Pushpa Rani had lost the companionship of life partner. The future of children of deceased had also become dark. The claimants were having great love and affection with the deceased, but due to death of deceased, the claimants have been deprived from love and affection of the deceased. The deceased was also shelter of his old aged mother i.e. claimant Gurdev Kaur, but said accident snatched the shelter of old aged mother due to death of deceased. He further deposed that now claimant no.3 Baljit Singh son of deceased Ramesh Lal has died. He proved salary certificate of deceased Ex.A1. Claimant Manjit Singh stepped into the witness box and tendered into evidence his affidavit Ex.CB corroborating the testimony of CW1 Sukhchain Singh. Since the Hon'ble High Court had granted only two opportunities to lead their respective evidence, therefore, the evidence of claimants was closed by order vide order dated 16.08.2017. 6. On the other hand, Ld.counsel for respondent no.2 suffered statement that evidence already given in the main petition be read as part of evidence after its remand by the Hon'ble High Court . In the main claim petition, the respondent no.2 had tendered into evidence copy of Insurance Policy Ex.R2, copy of judgment Ex.R3. Ld.counsel for respondent no.1 had also tendered into evidence driving licence of Surjit Singh Ex.R1. Thereafter, the evidence of respondents was closed by order vide order dated 08.09.2017. Pushpa Rani vs. Sarwan Singh 10CIS.No.MACP/122/2015. 7. Ld.counsel for respondent insurance company argued that the affidavit of claimant tendered in this claim petition cannot be considered and insurance company is not liable to pay compensation. Government pleader on behalf of respondents no.3 and 4 vehemently argued that no compensation is to be awarded as the claim petition against respondents no.3 and 4. 8. Ld.counsel for claimants has relied upon the order dated 20.02.2014 passed by the Hon'ble High Court in FAO No.1336 of 1997, where, it is specifically recorded that respondents no.3 and 4 are necessary parties for disposal of appeal. Hon'ble High Court while deciding the above said FAO held as under:- “Parliament either under the 1939 Act or the 1988 Act did not take into consideration a situation of this nature. No doubt, respondents no.3 and 4 continued to be the registered owner of the vehicle despite the fact that the same was requisitioned by the District Magistrate in exercise of its power conferred upon it under the Representation of People Act. A vehicle is requisitioned by a statutory authority, pursuant to the provisions contained in a statute. The owner of the vehicle cannot refuse to abide by the order of requisition of the vehicle by the Deputy Commissioner. While the vehicle remains under requisition, the owner does not exercise any control thereover. The driver may still be the employee of the owner of the vehicle but he has to drive it as per the direction of the officer of the State, who is put in-charge thereof. Save and except for legal ownership, for all intent and purport, the registered owner of the vehicle loses entire control there-over. He has no say as to whether the vehicle should be driven at a given point of time or not. He cannot ask the driver not to drive a vehicle on a bad road. He or the driver could not possibly say that the vehicle would not be driven in the night. The purpose of requisition is to use the vehicle. For the period the vehicle remains under the control of Pushpa Rani vs. Sarwan Singh 10CIS.No.MACP/122/2015. the State and/or its officers, the owner is only entitled to payment of compensation therefor in terms of the Act but he cannot exercise any control thereupon. In a situation of this nature, this Court must proceed on the presumption that the Parliament while enacting the 1988 Act did not envisage such a situation. If in a given situation, the statutory definitions contained in the 1988 Act cannot be given effect to in letter and spirit, the same should be understood from the common sense point of view. Ultimately, it was held that in such a case, the State would be liable to pay the compensation. In the present case, the judgment cited above is applicable on all fours. Consequently, the finding that the heirs of the deceased are not entitled to any compensation is set aside. I find that the Tribunal has not quantified the compensation payable. In the circumstances, the matter is remanded back to the Tribunal to re-decide the issue no.7:- “7. To what amount of compensation, the claimants are entitled to and from whom? For this purpose, the Tribunal will give two effective opportunities to the appellant to prove the income and the respondents will also be granted two opportunities” So, in view of said order of Hon'ble High Court , the State would be liable to pay the compensation and respondents no.3 and 4 have been arrayed on behalf of State and they are necessary parties for the disposal of present claim petition, as per directions of Hon'ble High Court . 9. Further in ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co.Ltd. vs. Bahpati Saikia and others 2015 ACJ 2862 (Gauhati), it was held as under:- “This judgment was followed by this court in the case of Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. vs. Dalin Mawlieh, 2008 ACJ Pushpa Rani vs. Sarwan Singh 10CIS.No.MACP/122/2015. 2390 (Gauhati). That being the position, there is no escape from holding that the insurance company cannot be made liable to make payment of compensation in this case. It is admitted position of fact that the vehicle was under police duty on being requisitioned by the State of Assam. That being the position in this case, also the owner did not have any control over the vehicle. The liability of the insurance company arises because the insurance contract with owner. There was no contract with the State. Having so found, it is to be held that the appeal has merit. It is accordingly allowed.” 10. In Purnya Kala Devi vs. State of Assam and another 2014(2) RCR (Civil) 591 (S.C.), where, it was held as under:- “Therefore, respondent no.1 was squarely covered under the definition of “owner” as contained in Section 2(30) of the 1988 Act. The High Court failed to appreciate the underlying legislative intention in including in the definition of “owner” a person in possession of a vehicle either under an agreement of lease or agreement of hypothecation or under a hire-purchase agreement to the effect that a person in control and possession of the vehicle should be construed as the “owner” and not alone the registered owner. The High Court further failed to appreciate the legislative intention that the registered owner of the vehicle should not be held liable if the vehicle was not in his possession and control. The High Court also failed to appreciate that Section 146 of the 1988 Act requires that no person should use or cause or allow any other person to use a motor vehicle in a public place without an insurance policy meeting the requirements of Chapter XI of the 1988 Act and the State Government has violated the statutory provisions of the 1988 Act.” So, in view of above said case law, it is clear that a person in possession of a vehicle either under an agreement of lease or agreement of Pushpa Rani vs. Sarwan Singh 10CIS.No.MACP/122/2015. hypothecation or under a hire-purchase agreement to the effect that a person in control and possession of the vehicle should be construed as the “owner” and not alone the registered owner and that the registered owner of the vehicle should not be held liable if the vehicle was not in his possession and control. 11. Now coming to the evidence of parties. RW2 PHG Jarnail Singh of Police Station Dehlon had admitted that the truck was on official duty. Even, the name and address of the owner of motor vehicle was stated in the claim petition in para no.17 as Respondent no.1 being owner of the truck and respondents no.3 and 4 as the truck has been requisitioned by SSP Police District Jagraon which is under the Ministry of Home Affairs, State of Punjab. There is further admission on the part of RW2 PHG Jarnail Singh that the truck was on official duty. As such, the compensation is to be paid by the State i.e. respondents no.3 and 4 and not by the Insurance Company i.e. respondent no.2. 12. Now let us consider the quantum of compensation. The appropriate method of calculating compensation in the fatal case is multiplier method. Starting point for calculating amount of compensation to be paid to the dependents of deceased, in a Motor Vehicle Accidental Claim is an amount of monthly, which the deceased was earning, then there is an estimate that what was required for his personal and living expenses. The balance will generally be termed in lump sum by taking certain number of events of purchase. 13.Now first of all, this Tribunal is going to assess the income of the deceased Ramesh Lal. The claimants have claimed compensation to the tune of Rs.10,00,000/- on account of death of deceased Ramesh Lal. The deceased was having the age of 43 years at the time of his death. From the salary certificate of deceased Ramesh Lal Ex.A1, proved by CW1 Sukhchain Singh, it reveals that his date of birth is recorded as 14.01.1950, which means that he was 43 years of age at the time of accident. Further as per salary certificate, the deceased was drawing Rs.1440/- + DA as admissible to Central Government Employees. Further Pushpa Rani vs. Sarwan Singh 10CIS.No.MACP/122/2015. as per para no.6 of the claim petition, the deceased was getting Rs.2655/- p.m. as salary, besides Rs.53/- per day while posted in Punjab coming out to be Rs.4400/- per month. Thus, the monthly income of the deceased is held to be Rs.2655/- rounded off Rs.2700/- per month. However, the amount of Rs.53/- per day is not considered as the income of the deceased as the deceased was on official duty for few days and Rs.53/- per day was to be paid as special pay. Further, during the proceedings of the case, it has come on record that claimant no.3 Baljit Singh has expired. As such, Claimant no.1 Pushpa Rani being widow, Manjit Singh being son and Gurdev Kaur being mother of deceased Ramesh Lal are entitled to compensation, being heirs and dependents upon the income of the deceased. 14. As per law laid in cases Rajesh and Others Vs. Rajbir Singh and Others -2013 ACJ 1403 (SC) , while calculating the compensation, loss of future prospectus at the rate of 50% are to be added in the annual income of the victim, who was of age 42 years. So, by adding 50% amount i.e. Rs.1350/-, total annual income of the deceased comes to Rs.4050/-. As per law laid in case Smt.Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and others -2009(3) Punjab Law Reporter 22 , multiplier of '14' is to be applied as age of the victim is between 41 to 45 years. Further amount to the extent of 1/3 (one-third) is to be reduced from the compensation amount on account of personal and living expenses of the deceased, as deceased Ramesh Lal was married. In the present case, the deceased was 43 years old at the time of accident. Keeping in view the concept of consortium referred to above, the widow of the deceased is entitled to Rs.1,00,000/- towards `loss of consortium'. The amount of Rs.25000/- under the head of `funeral expenses and transportation' would be just and reasonable. Keeping in view all these facts and circumstances of the case, claimants are held entitled to get compensation, as under:- Date of accident 07.02.1993 Age of the deceased: 43 years Claimants: 1.Pushpa Devi, widow. 2.Manjit Singh, minor son at the time of accident. 3.Gurdev Kaur, Pushpa Rani vs. Sarwan Singh 10CIS.No.MACP/122/2015. mother Heads of claim Tribunal Sr. No. Amount (Rs.) 1. Income (annual) 32,400/- 2. Deduction 1/3 (one- third)10,800 out of Rs.32,400 = 21,600/- per annum. 3. Multiplicand (annualized)42 years 4. Multiplier 14 5. Loss of dependence 3,02,400/- 6. Add 50% as Future prospectus1,51,200/- 7. Loss of Consortium 1,00,000/- 8. Funeral expenses 25,000/- 9. Total 5,78,600/- In view of the aforesaid discussion, it is hereby held that the claimants are entitled to a sum of Rs.5,78,600/- along with interest @ 6% per annum from the date of filing of petition till its realization from the respondents. 15.Now the next question has arisen as to who will pay the compensation to the claimants. As already observed herein above, the State of Punjab i.e. respondents no.3 and 4 are held liable to pay the amount of compensation to the claimants. Thus, in the light of the facts so disclosed, I hold that respondents no.3 and 4 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the claimants. 16.In view of my above detailed discussion, issue no.7 is decided in favour of claimants and against respondent no.3 and 4. Hence, issue no.7 is re-decided as per direction of Hon'ble High Court vide order dated 20.02.2014 passed in FAO No.1336 of 1997. Ahlmad is directed to send the record alongwith this order, complete in all respects, immediately to the Hon'ble High Court . Hence the report is submitted. Pronounced Dated: 08.09.2017.

At about 6.30 a.m., when they reached G.T. Road towards Bridge of Village Rajgarh, some smog was there and a Canter bearing No. PB-07-L-8566 was standing in the centre of the road and no indication of light and other option was there, due to which the motorcycle which was being driven by Hardeep Singh, struck against the above said Canter and the bike went under the said Canter. As a result of which, both of them suffered severe injuries. With the help of people and passersby they took out underneath the Canter, but, both Jagtar Singh and Hardeep Singh died at the spot. Further claimants have averred that this accident took place due to negligence driving of Respondent No. 1 and a FIR No. 205 dated 27- 12-2014 was also registered on the statement of Kuldeep Singh son of Ram Singh under Sections 283, 304-A & 427 of IPC against respondent No. 1 with P. S. Doraha. Therefore, respondent No. 1 Jagroop Singh being driver, respondents No. 2 to 4 being owners of the offending Vehicle in concurrence with respondent No. 5 insurer of the same are jointly & severally liable to pay compensation to the claimants as per provisions of Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act.

It was, however, submitted that claimants are not entitled for any amount of compensation. 4. Respondent No. 5 insurance company has contested the claim petition on the ground that that petition is not maintainable. It is further submitted that at the time of accident respondent No. 1 did not possess any valid driving license to drive the offending vehicle in question and further it was averred that owner of the offending vehicle was not holding valid registration & fitness certificate qua the same at the relevant time and thus there was clear violation of terms & conditions of the insurance policy. At the end it was also denied that any such accident took place with the offending vehicle on the given time and place as alleged by the claimants. It was also averred that a false FIR has been registered by the local police and other documents alleged to have been prepared by the hospital authorities are also false & fabricated.

I have heard Sh. B.S.Virk, Advocate, learned counsel for claimants, Sh. J.S. Bhogal, Advocate, learned counsel for respondents No.1, 3, 4, Sh. H.S. Narang, Advocate, learned counsel for respondent No. 2, Sh. Rajiv Abhi, Advocate, learned counsel for respondent No. 5 and have perused the entire record carefully with their valuable assistance. My issue-wise findings are as under: ISSUES No. 1 & 2 9. Both these issues are interconnected and in order to avoid repetition of discussion of evidence, these issues are taken up together. 10. Onus to prove these issues was on Claimants and Sh. B.S. Virk, Advocate, learned counsel for claimants relying upon statement made by Kulwant Kaur claimant as PW1, who proved on record documents i.e. certified copy of FIR Ex.C1, copy of postmortem report Ex.C2, Salary certificate Ex.C3, Insurance Covernote Ex.C4, Copy of RC of offending Vehicle Ex.C5, Copy of Driving Licence of Respondent No.1 Kulwant Kaur & Ors.

As a result of which, both Jagtar Singh and Hardeep Singh died at the spot. Further claimants have averred that this accident took place due to negligent driving of Respondent No. 1 and a FIR No. 205 dated 27-12- 2014 was also registered on the statement of Kuldeep Singh son of Ram Singh under Sections 283, 304-A & 427 of IPC against respondent No. 1 with P. S. Doraha. Claimants being widow, daughters and parents of deceased Sh. Jagtar Singh respectively are entitled to a sum of Rupees Twenty Lacs on account of compensation in this regard from respondents, who are jointly and severally liable for paying the said amount. He has thus urged that these issues be decided in favour of petitioners and against respondents. 11. All these arguments have been vigorously refuted by Sh. J.S. Bhogal, Advocate, learned counsel for respondents No. 1, 3, 4, Sh. H.S.Narang, Advocate, learned counsel for respondent No. 2, Sh. Rajiv Abhi, Advocate, learned counsel for respondent No. 5, who have contended that evidence led on record by claimants does not prove that Kulwant Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jagroop Singh etc. , Case No. MACP / 270 / 2015 , MACT No. 06 of 24-09-2015 CNR No. PBLD01-016358-2015 , Date of decision : 2-2-2018 8 Jagtar Singh had died due to rash & negligent driving of respondent No.1. Claimants have failed to prove that accident has taken place due to rash and negligent act of driver of Canter. They have thus, urged that no responsibility can be fastened on respondents in this regard. They have thus urged that these issues be decided against petitioners and in favour of respondents. 12. I have given thoughtful consideration to these submissions and in order to appreciate the same, have gone through record of this case minutely. 13. Onus to prove this issue was on the claimants. Since the present petition is under Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act, it is the bounden duty of the claimants to prove that respondent No. 1 was rash & negligent in driving the vehicle at the time of accident. In order to prove this issue, learned counsel for the claimants has relied upon statement of PW2 Kuldeep Singh eye-witness of the accident, wherein he has deposed that on 27-12-2014, his brother Jagtar Singh alongwith his friend Hardeep Singh were going to his duty on motorcycle of Hardeep Singh. Hardeep Singh was driving his Motorcycle whereas Jagtar Singh was sitting on pillion seat. He was following them on his separate motorcycle as he was going to Sahnewal for some domestic work. At about 6.30 a.m., when they reached G.T. Road towards Bridge of Village Rajgarh, some smog was there and a Canter bearing No. PB-07-L-8566 was standing in the centre of the road and no indication of light and other Kulwant Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jagroop Singh etc. , Case No. MACP / 270 / 2015 , MACT No. 06 of 24-09-2015 CNR No. PBLD01-016358-2015 , Date of decision : 2-2-2018 9 option was there, due to which the motorcycle which was being driven by Hardeep Singh, struck against the above said Canter and the bike went under the said Canter. As a result of which, both of them suffered severe injuries. With the help of people and passersby they took out underneath the Canter, but, both Jagtar Singh and Hardeep Singh died at the spot. He further stated that this accident took place due to negligent driving of Respondent No. 1. This witness has further deposed that a criminal case bearing FIR No. 205 dated 27-12-2014 was also registered on his statement under Sections 283, 304-A & 427 of IPC against respondent No. 1 with P. S. Doraha. This witness was thoroughly cross-examined by learned counsel for the respondents. The statement of this witness also stands corroborated from the copy of FIR Ex.C1. 14. It has to be borne in mind that the Motor Vehicles Act does not envisage holding a trial for a Petition preferred under Section 166 of the Act. Under Section 168 of the Act, a Claims Tribunal is enjoined to hold an inquiry to determine compensation which must appear to it to be just. Strict rules of evidence are not applicable in an inquiry conducted by the Claims Tribunal. In State of Mysore v. S.S. Makapur, 1993 (2) SCR 943 , the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the Tribunals exercising quasi-judicial functions are not courts and are not bound by strict rules of evidence. The relevant portion of the report in State of Mysore (supra) is extracted hereunder: Kulwant Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jagroop Singh etc. , Case No. MACP / 270 / 2015 , MACT No. 06 of 24-09-2015 CNR No. PBLD01-016358-2015 , Date of decision : 2-2-2018 10 ""......that tribunals exercising quasi-judicial functions are not courts and that therefore they are not bound to follow the procedure prescribed for trial of actions in courts nor are they bound by strict rules of evidence. They can unlike courts, obtain all information for the points under the enquiry from all sources, and through all channels, without being fettered by rules and procedure, which govern proceedings in court. The only obligation which the law casts on them is that they should not act on any information which they may receive unless they put it to the party against whom it is to be used and give him a fair opportunity to explain it. What is a fair opportunity depend on the facts and circumstances of each case but where such an opportunity has been given, the proceedings are not open to attack on the ground that the enquiry was not conducted in accordance with the procedure followed in courts."" 15. In Bimla Devi and Ors. v. Himachal Road Transport Corporation and Ors., (2009) 13 SC 530 , the Hon'ble Apex Court held that in a Petition under Section 166 of the Act, the Claimants were merely to establish their case on the touchstone of preponderance of probability and holistic view is to be taken while dealing with the Claim Petition under the Motor Vehicles Act. Para 15 is extracted hereunder: ""15. In a situation of this nature, the Tribunal has rightly Kulwant Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jagroop Singh etc. , Case No. MACP / 270 / 2015 , MACT No. 06 of 24-09-2015 CNR No. PBLD01-016358-2015 , Date of decision : 2-2-2018 11 taken a holistic view of the matter. It was necessary to be borne in mind that strict proof of an accident caused by a particular bus in a particular manner may not be possible to be done by the claimants. The claimants were merely to establish their case on the touchstone of preponderance of probability. The standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt could not have been applied."" 16. To determine the negligence of the driver of the offending vehicle, this court is guided by the judgment of Hon'ble High Court in case titled as “National Insurance Company Limited Versus Pushpa Rani” 2009 ACJ 287, wherein Hon'ble High Court has held that in case the petitioner files the certified copies of the criminal record or the criminal record showing the completion of the investigation by the police or issuance of charge sheet under Sections 279 / 304-A IPC or the certified copy of FIR or the recovery memo of the mechanical inspection report of the offending vehicle, then these documents are sufficient proof to reach to a conclusion that the driver was negligent. It was further held that the proceedings under the Motor Vehicle Act are not akin to the proceedings in a civil suit and hence strict rules of evidence are not required to be followed in this regard. Further in case titled as “Kaushnumma Begam & Others Versus New India Assurance Company Limited” 2001 ACJ 421 SC, the issue of wrongful act or omission on the part of driver of the motor vehicle involved in an accident Kulwant Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jagroop Singh etc. , Case No. MACP / 270 / 2015 , MACT No. 06 of 24-09-2015 CNR No. PBLD01-016358-2015 , Date of decision : 2-2-2018 12 has been left to a secondary importance and mere use or involvement of motor vehicle in causing bodily injuries or death to a human being or damage to property would make the petition maintainable U/s 166 of Motor Vehicle Act. It is also settled law that the term rashness and negligence has to be construed lightly while making a decision on a petition for claim for the same as compared to the word rashness and negligence as finds mention in the Indian Penal Code. This is because of the fact that the chapter in the Motor Vehicle Act dealing with compensation is a benevolent legislation and not a penal one. 17. During arguments, learned counsel for respondent No. 5 insurance company has contended on the point that since the respondent No. 1 was not authorized to drive the vehicle in question, as such the respondent no. 5 i.e. Insurance Company is not liable to pay the amount. It has also been contended that the Driver was holding the Licence to drive LMV and not MTV . The driving Licence of Respondent no. 1 Jagroop Singh has been produced as Ex.R12 and has proved the verification report of the driving licence of respondent no. 1 as Ex.R8. From the above documents, it is clear that the respondent no. 1 was having a valid driving licence at the time of accident. The only question to be determined is whether the liability of respondent no. 5 can be absolved on the ground that the driver was not authorized to drive the vehicle in question. In Kulwant Singh v. Oriental Insurance Company Kulwant Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jagroop Singh etc. , Case No. MACP / 270 / 2015 , MACT No. 06 of 24-09-2015 CNR No. PBLD01-016358-2015 , Date of decision : 2-2-2018 13 Ltd. (SC) 2014(4) R.C.R.(Civil) 977 : 2014(6) Recent Apex Judgments (R.A.J.) 245 , Driver possessed driving licence for driving ""light motor vehicle"", but was driving ""light goods vehicle"" when accident occurred. It has been held by Hon'ble Supreme Court that there is no breach of Insurance Policy. In the case of National Insurance Company Ltd. v. Annappa Irappa Nesaria alias Nesaragi and Others, 2008 (3) SCC 464, the vehicle involved in the accident was a matador having a goods carriage permit and was insured with the insurance company. An issue was raised that the driver of the vehicle did not possess an effective driving licence to drive a transport vehicle. The Tribunal held that the driver was having a valid driving licence and allowed the claim. In appeal filed by the insurance company, the High Court dismissed the appeal holding that the claimants are third parties and even on the ground that there is violation of terms and conditions of the policy the insurance company cannot be permitted to contend that it has no liability. This Court after considering the relevant provisions of the Act and definition and meaning of light goods carriage, light motor vehicles, heavy goods vehicles, finally came to conclusion that the driver, who was holding the licence duly granted to drive light motor vehicle, was entitled to drive the light passenger carriage vehicle, namely, the matador. Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under : ""20. From what has been noticed hereinbefore, it is Kulwant Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jagroop Singh etc. , Case No. MACP / 270 / 2015 , MACT No. 06 of 24-09-2015 CNR No. PBLD01-016358-2015 , Date of decision : 2-2-2018 14 evident that ""transport vehicle"" has now been substituted for ""medium goods vehicle"" and ""heavy goods vehicle"". The light motor vehicle continued, at the relevant point of time to cover both ""light passenger carriage vehicle"" and ""light goods carriage vehicle"". A driver who had a valid licence to drive a light motor vehicle, therefore was authorised to drive a light goods vehicle as well."" In S. Iyyapan v. M/s. United India Insurance Company Ltd. (SC) 2013(3) SCC(Cri) 11 : 2013(4) Recent Apex Judgments (R.A.J.) 303 : 2013(3) R.C.R.(Civil) 654, Driver was holding licence to drive light vehicle but driving commercial vehicle in violation of Insurance Policy and causing death of a person. The question arisen was, whether an Insurance Company disown its liability on the ground that the driver of the vehicle although duly licensed to drive light motor vehicle but there was no endorsement in the licence to drive light motor vehicle used as commercial vehicle - (No) – It has been held by Hon'ble Supreme Court that the Insurance company cannot disown its liability on the ground that although the driver was holding a licence to driver a light motor vehicle but was driving commercial vehicle. In view of the facts and circumstances of the case & above referred case law, I am of the considered view that the liability of Insurance Company cannot be absolved. So far as contention of learned Kulwant Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jagroop Singh etc. , Case No. MACP / 270 / 2015 , MACT No. 06 of 24-09-2015 CNR No. PBLD01-016358-2015 , Date of decision : 2-2-2018 15 counsel for respondent No. 5 is concerned, as per statement of PW2 Kuldeep Singh, it is clear that respondent no. 1 has parked the Canter bearing no. PB-07-L-8566 on the road without parking lights on, or indicators, or without any other indication to the persons regarding the standing of the vehicle. Therefore, from the evidence of PW2 Kuldeep Singh in corroboration with copy of FIR Ex.C1, it is clear that the act of respondent No. 1 while parking the Canter in centre of the road was negligent, which resulted in the death of Jagtar Singh. 18. So far as, the entitlement of the claimants are concerned, claimant no. 1 is widow, claimant no. 2 & 3 are the Daughters and claimants No.4 & 5 are parents of the deceased. So far as the loss of dependency is concerned, it is clear from the evidence of PW1 Kulwant Kaur that deceased Jagtar Singh was the sole earning member in his family and the claimants were totally dependents upon the deceased. Wife and minor daughters are to be treated as dependents upon deceased Jagtar Singh. Under these circumstances, claimants are entitled for compensation on account to loss of dependency and loss of consortium. Dependency of the claimants is also to be considered. All these facts are to be taken while awarding amount of compensation to petitioners in this case. 19. Question arises as to how much compensation in this case can be granted to claimants. It is claim of claimants that Jagtar Kulwant Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jagroop Singh etc. , Case No. MACP / 270 / 2015 , MACT No. 06 of 24-09-2015 CNR No. PBLD01-016358-2015 , Date of decision : 2-2-2018 16 Singh was 32 years of age and was earning Rs. 20,000/- per month by working in M/s. G. S. Auto International as Machine Operator. His death has caused monetary loss to claimants and as such, they have suffered agony and unbearable pain as deceased was husband of claimant no. 1 , father of claimants no. 2 & 3 and son of claimants no. 4 & 5 and they are also entitled to compensation on account of mental agony, love and affection (sic) and as such, they are entitled to compensation to the tune of Rs. 20 lacs alongwith interest from the date of filing the petition till date of realization. 20. So far as, the evidence of the income of Jagtar Singh is concerned, claimants have proved on record salary certificate Ex.C3 issued by Asstt. Manager of M/s. G.S.Auto International Ltd., showing the salary being paid to deceased Jagtar Singh as Rs.6795/- per month. No employee or witness from the concerned factory has been examined to prove the employment and the income of deceased Jagtar Singh. There is no document to show that deceased was earning Rs. 20,000/- from the work or that he was skilled worker or by doing the work of dairy farming. Dependency of the claimants is also to be considered. All these facts are to be taken while awarding amount of compensation to petitioners in this case. Fact remains that deceased Jagtar Singh was a man of 32 years. So far as the income of the deceased Jagtar Singh is concerned, when there is no corroboration of document Ex.C3 to prove the exact Kulwant Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jagroop Singh etc. , Case No. MACP / 270 / 2015 , MACT No. 06 of 24-09-2015 CNR No. PBLD01-016358-2015 , Date of decision : 2-2-2018 17 income, the notional income of a person is to be considered and as such, his income is assessed at Rs. 8000/- per month. Since the deceased was treated as self employed, in view of the National Insurance Company Limited v. Pranay Sethi (SC)(Constitution Bench) Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 25590 of 2014. D/d. 31.10.2017, an addition of 40% of the established income is allowed. As such, the amount of income comes to Rs. 11200/-. He might be spending some amount upon himself and I deduct a sum of Rs. 3200/- as his personal expenses per month. That way, he had been contributing a sum of Rs. 96,000/- per year to claimants and keeping in view age of deceased, it is a fit case where multiplier of 16 can be applied. So, claimants can be awarded a sum of Rs. 15,36,000/- on account of loss of income. They are also entitled to Rs.10,000/- as cremation expenses, a sum of Rs. 15,000/- as consortium and Rs. 15,000/- on account of loss of love and affection. Accordingly, claimants are awarded compensation to the tune of Rs. 15,76,000/-. 21. So far as the liability to pay the amount is concerned, RW1 Neelam, Clerk of the Office of Secretary, Regional Transport Authority has specifically stated in her cross-examination that as per record Oswal Sugar Limited, G.T. Road, Mukerian, District Hoshiarpur, respondent No.1, was not owner in question on 27-12-2014 and Gurdeep Singh, respondent No.3 was registered owner of the vehicle in question from 1-6-2010. As per testimony of this witness, Driving Licence of respondent No.1, Jagroop Singh, driver of offending vehicle, was valid on Kulwant Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jagroop Singh etc. , Case No. MACP / 270 / 2015 , MACT No. 06 of 24-09-2015 CNR No. PBLD01-016358-2015 , Date of decision : 2-2-2018 18 the day of accident. Under such circumstances, when the Respondent no. 1 was driver, Respondent No. 3 was owner and Respondent no. 5 is the insurer of the Canter No. PB-07-L-8566 at the time of occurrence. As such, the Respondents No. 1, 3 and 5 are responsible for making the payment. Since on the date of accident, respondent no. 2 & 4 were not connected with the vehicle in any manner, as such they cannot be held responsible for payment of above amount. These issues are decided accordingly. ISSUE No. 3, 4, 5 & 6 22. Onus to prove these issues were on respondents, but no evidence has been led by these respondents to discharge their onus and consequently, these issues are decided against respondents and in favour of claimants. ISSUE No. 6 (Relief) 23. In view of my findings on various issues, this claim petition partly succeeds and same is hereby partly accepted and claimants are held entitled to Rs. 15,76 ,000/- from respondents No. 1 , 3 & 5 as compensation on account of death of Jagtar Singh. Petition against respondents No. 2 & 4 is dismissed. The amount of compensation will be apportioned as under : Claimant No. 1 Rs. 5,26,000/- Claimants No. 2 & 3 (children) Rs. 2,50,000/- each Claimants No. 4 & 5 Rs. 2,75,000/- each Kulwant Kaur & Ors.

Upon notice, the respondent no.1 did not appear in the court despite service and he was proceeded against exparte vide order dated 28.03.2016. 4.Respondent No.2 appeared and filed the written reply by raising preliminary objections that claim petition is not maintainable since no accident has ever taken place as alleged in the claim petition; and there is no company constituted under the name and style of ICICI Lombard Motor Insureance Co.

On the other hand, Ms. Shohima clerk/Ahlmad was produced as RW1 and learned counsel for the respondent no.2 has tendered into evidence copy of policy Ex.R1 and closed his evidence vide his separate statement. 6.I have heard the Ld. Counsel for the parties and also considered the written submissions filed by the learned counsel on behalf of the respondents. My issue wise findings are as under:- Issue no.1 7.Onus to prove this issue was upon the claimant and to prove the factum of accident, the claimant herself appeared as CW1, who testified on 14 her affidavit Ex.CA that on 31.03.2015, she alongwith her father Gurmeet Singh was returning from her college at Sudhar after attending the parents meeting on their motor-cycle bearing No.PB-10CM-8124 which was being driven by her father. When they crossed Bus Stand of Dakha at about 3-15 PM, a Sardar person came on motor cycle bearing No.PB-08CW-0494 (Offending motor-cycle) driving very rashly and negligently without blowing any horn at a very high speed and hit the motor-cycle of the father of the claimant very badly. Due to which she and her father Gurmeet Singh fell down on the road, on account of this accident, she alongwith her father received grievous injuries and damaged the motor-cycle of the father of the claimant. Some passersby called the Ambulance No.108 and thereafter she alongwith her father were removed to Guru Tegh Bahadur Sahib Hospital, Ludhiana where the medical examination of the claimant was conducted. On the statement of the father of the claimant, FIR No.100 dated 10.04.2015, u/ss 279/337/338/427 IPC was registered at P.S. Dakha Ludhiana against respondent No.1. Due to accident claimant received grevious injuries and plastic surgery of the fact of claimant was got done and claimant also lost her one upper third molar teeth. She remained admitted in the hospital from 31.03.2015 to 13.04.2015 and spent Rs. 1,31,041/- on her treatment. He further pleaded that due to accident she has become dependent upon others for her routine work and she also suffered her studies and on account of facial injury and surgery the mariage prospects of claimant are also badly affected. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1 while driving the motor cycle bearing No.PB-08CW-0494. 8.Claimant also examined Dr. Jagdeep Maddan who proved the injuries on the person of the claimant. He further deposed that the claimant remained admitted in the hospital on 31.03.2015 and was discharged on 14 13.04.2015. She was medico-legally examined by him. The patient was got admitted with following injureis:- (I) fracture on left patela., (II) Fracture maxilla. Patela fracture was operated by him and maxilla fracture was treated by Dr. Ish Garg. Wriring was done regarding the patela suregery. He proved the discharge card Ex.C3 and Ex.C4 and C5 treatment documents after surgery for physiotherapy. He also proved Ex.C6, C10 and C11. 9.Claimant also examined Dr. Ish Garg, who proved the injuries on the person of the claimant. He further deposed that the claimant remained admitted in the hospital on 31.03.2015 and was discharged on 13.04.2015. She was medico-legally examined by him. The patient was got admitted with following injureis:- (I) fracture on left patela., (II) Fracture maxilla and (III) Head injury i.e. Hemmorrhage in brain and fracture of skull bonde. Maxilla fracture was treated by him and arch bar wiring of fracture maxilla was also done. Treatment of head injury was treated by Dr. Ajay Dhawan (Neuro Surgeon). He proved the discharge card Ex.C3, summary of bills Ex.PC6, duplicate receipts Ex.C7 and C8, bill of implants applied on patient Ex.C9, Bill of implant applied on knee Ex.C12. Summary of bill Ex.C13, Ex.C14 to C72 bills regarding treatment and medicine. 10.On record, there is nothing in evidence to discard or disbelieve the version of PW1 either in toto or in particular. The version of PW1 is lend credence by the version emanating in the First Information Report Ex.C85 bearing number 100 d ated 10.04.2015, under section 279/337/338/427 IPC was registered at P.S. Dakha, Ludhiana. 11.Conversely, the respondent no.1 did not step into witness box to testify in contrary to the version of PW1 . 12.In the instant case, to prove the negligence, the claimant himself 14 appeared as CW1 and proved on record the copy of the FIR EX.C85 and nothing useful could be brought out of the lengthy cross examination conducted upon CW1. Otherwise also, there are no reasons for PW1 to depose falsely or implicate the respondent driver and to allow the actual culprit to go scot free. Apart from it, the respondent driver was proceed exparte. In these circumstances, the driver i.e. the respondent no.1 of the offending vehicle was the most material witness to depose about this fact but he did not appear before the Tribunal for the reasons best known to him. As such, it is clear that on this ground alone, an adverse inference can be drawn against him. 13.The Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 being a welfare legislation, the appreciation of evidence and assessment is not regulated by technicalities. Even otherwise, it is pertinent to observe that the degree of proof required for proving the negligence on the part of the driver in the present proceedings, is not as vigorous as is required in proving the guilt of the accused in criminal trial. The intent of the present legislation is benevolent and the entire purpose of the legislation is likely to be defeated if in each case the claimant is asked to prove beyond reasonable doubt the involvement and negligence on the part of the driver. It is now settled that registration of criminal case against the driver of the offending vehicle for causing accident, by rash and negligent driving, is the prima facie proof that the accident was the result of rashness and negligence on his part as settled in Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Shyam and others 1993 (2) P .L.R. 109. Resultantly, the factum of registration of criminal case against respondent no.1 further proves that the accident was caused by his rash and negligent driving. 14.The aforesaid discussion leads to the conclusion that the claimant has been able to prove that he suffered injuries to the rash and negligent 14 driving of respondent no.1 while driving the offending motor cycle bearing No.PB-08CW-0494. Hence, this issue is decided accordingly in favour of the claimant and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.2 14. Since the findings of issue no.1 has been returned in favour of claimant to the effect that the claimant had suffered injuries in the accident with the offending vehicle, the claimant is entitled to compensation under the Motor Vehicle Act 1988 as amended till date under the following heads:- MEDICAL BILLS 15.The claimant suffered grievous injuries and remained admitted in the hospital for 11 days. In order to claim the medical expenditure, the claimant has placed on record medical bills Ex.C7 to C72, Ex.C6 is summary of medicine bills. The claimant also produced on record the details of medical bills and as per the details of medical bills furnished by the claimant, the total amount as shown by the claimant spent on getting medical treatment as well as for purchase of medicines is Rs.1,22,812. It is pertinent to note here that Ex.C73 to Ex.C84 are the receipts of the advance payment made by the claimants towards taxi charges. However, learned counsel on behalf of the respondents has submitted the medical bills produced on record by the claimants are not proved as per the Evidence Act, as such, those may not be considered for awarding compensation under this act. I have considered the submission of the learned counsel for the respondents. However, the Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in case S mt.Parsanni Vs. Sh.Sube Singh and another, 2012(2), PLR, 309 has held that productions of the bill relating to the purchase of medicines during the period of hospitalization and oral evidence given by the parties about purchasing of medicines ought to be taken as sufficient proof of authentication and admissibility of these 14 documents. The Hon'ble court further held that even as regards the examination of the doctor, it should be confined only to securing appropriate proof of disability and in special circumstances where there is prolong treatment or a requirement for continuous treatment, even beyond the period of trial, the attempt of the tribunal must be to elicit from the doctors, the prognosis for cure and the likely expenses that may have to be incurred in future. In the light of the ratio of law, this is not a case where the bills pertains to long treatment were not required to prove the medical bills. Keeping in view the nature of the injuries, the alleged amount might have spent by the claimant in getting the treatment. Accordingly, an award of Rs.1,22,812/- is, hereby, passed in favour of the claimant. PAIN AND SUFFERING 16.The claimant sustained grievous injuries i.e. fracture on left patela, fracture maxilla and head injury. She remained hospitalized for 14 days. The claimant was 18 years old at the time she sustained injuries due to the accident. Keeping in view the nature of injuries, she must have suffered inconvenience and discomfort in her daily life apart from mental stress in his young age. In view of these facts and circumstances, I grant a sum of Rs.30,000/- under this head. DIET AND CONVEYANCE . 17.The claimant was aged about 18 years at the time of her meeting with the accident. Though, she has not filed on record any material to show that actual amount spent on diet but she produced on the record the receipts issued by Darshan Tour & Travels and Shivam Taxi Service Ex.C73 to Ex.C84 towards conveyance charges, yet she is awarded a sum of Rs.20,000/- conveyance charges as she would have admitted continuously for the treatment of injuries undergone and to her age to recover the injury. Having 14 regard to the fact that the claimant suffered grievous injuries, it can be presumed that she would have rendered immobile and would have needed special arrangement for her regular follow on from concerned Doctor and special diet for her injuries. As such, she is awarded a sum of Rs 10,000/- towards special diet. Having regard to the above, I award an amount of Rs.30,000/- to the claimant under this head. ATTENDANT CHARGES . 19.As has been observed in the foregoing paragraph, the claimant has not been able to manage the regular movement due to the nature of the injuries undergone by her. In view of the grievousness of the injuries, her routine work must have been effected for which, she would have needed attendant. In my view, attendant charges in lump sum amounting to Rs.5,000/- is awarded to the claimant, under the above head. LOSS OF INCOME 20.The claimant has alleged that at the time of accident, she was 18 years of age and was enjoying very good health. She further alleged that she was studying in D Pharmacy at Sudhar, Raikot, but due to the accident, she is confined to bed and has become dependent on other for her daily routine on account of injuries suffered in the accident. In support of her assertion, the claimant has relied upon Ex.C1 the identity card issued by the college and Ex.C2 character cum college leaving certificate. Having regard to the nature of injuries suffered by the claimant, it is in evidence that the claimant remained confined to bed for 14 days. Accordingly, the claimant cannot be awarded any compensation under this head as she was student and not earning any income. Disability 14 21.Herein the claimant has not examined any doctor nor there is any medical opinion or any other assessment as to the injuries sustained by claimant in accident had reduced the earning capacity of the claimant. The bare perusal of the medical papers does not reveal any disability qua impairment of the body as a whole. Also on record, the claimant in her affidavit Ex. CA has no where specified as to what had been the impact of the injuries on his vocation or profession or employment, nor it is specified that how it resulted in reduction in earning capacity of the claimant nor in copies of medical documents filed nor in disability certificate. In absence of mention of these facts, this tribunal is unable to assess the extent of reduction of any earning capacity of the claimant, if it is so and in such a situation, the contention of learned counsel for the claimant that the claimant must be held to have suffered permanent disability of earning capacity, cannot be accepted as the claimant has failed to prove on record the fact that the claimant become permanent disable, due to the injuries sustained by him, as a result of that accident. Accordingly, the claimant cannot be awarded any compensation under this head. 22. In view of my findings above, claimant is awarded the following compensation: MEDICAL TREATMENT :1,22,812/- ATTENDANT CHARGES : 5,000/- CONVEYANCE & SPECIAL DIET : 30000/- PAIN & SUFFERING : 30000/- LOSS OF INCOME :Nil DISABILTY :Nil Total : 1,87,812/- Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the claimant and against 14 the respondent No.1. ISSUE NO.3:- 20.Now the next question has arisen on the issue of liability to pay the compensation amount to the claimants. Learned counsel on behalf of Insurance Company has examined Ms. Shohima, Ahlmad in the court of Sh. Ankit Airi, JMIC Ludhiana. She brought the criminal case file titled as State Vs. Gurjit Singh and the file do not contain any registration certificate of motor-cycle bearing No. PB-08CW-0494 and the driving license of respondent No.1 Gurjit Singh. Even as per the recovery memo, the police has not taken into possession the registration certificate of the offending vehicle and the driving license of Gurjit Singh during the investigation of the case. Ld. Counsel for the respondent insurance company has placed reliance upon United India Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Sujata Arora and Others, 2013 ACJ 2129, wherein it was held by the Apex Court that the offending van was being driven by a person who was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident and exonerated insurance company from liability. Reliance was also placed upon Balbir Singh Vs. Nikka Ram and others, 2002 ACJ 309, wherein it was held by the Hon'ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana that driver was exparte and no licence was produced on the criminal case against the driver as such, it cannot be presumed that driver had a valid licence and the insurance company was exempted from liablity. 21.I have considered the rival submissions of learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent No.2. Admittedly, at the time of accident, the motor cycle was not having any registration certificate and respondent No.1 was not having any valid driving licence. As such, the case law referred above is applicable to the case in hand and keeping in view the 14 legal position, the respondent No.1 is liable to pay the compensation and the insurance company is exonerated from the liability to pay the compensation. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of respondent No.2. Issue No.4:- Onus to prove this issue was upon the respondents.

Respondents No.1 and 2 exparte. Sh.Vyom Bansal, Advocate, for respondent No.3 AWARD This petition under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act,1988 has been filed by Maina Devi, mother of deceased, seeking compensation from respondents on account of causing of death of her son Dinesh Kumar in a Motor Vehicular Accident on 26.5.2014. It is averred in the petition by claimant that Dinesh Kumar was aged just about 30 years and was working as a driver with M/s Ludhiana Bottling Company, C-54, Focal Point, Ludhiana, on monthly salary of Rs.9157/-. On 1 26.5.2014 it was about 6.20 AM. After completing his night duty he started from Coca Cola Depot, Shivpuri, Ludhiana on his Moped bearing No. PB-10-DU-4292 to return home. His brother Prabhu Dayal met him at Shivpuri Chowk, Ludhiana who started following Dinesh Kumar on his motorcycle. They crossed Samrala Chowk and reached just ahead of Punjab and Sind Bank, Mohalla Hira Nagar, Ludhiana. A sand loaded Truck bearing No. HR-64-3413 came from backside which was being driven by respondent No.1 at a high speed, without blowing horn, rashly and negligently. Consequently it hit into the Moped of Dinesh Kumar from rear. Moped fell on one side while Dinesh Kumar fell on the road and was run over by the said offending Truck crushing his leg and giving him other injuries. His bowls came out. Respondent No.1 came down the Truck and on asking disclosed his name Diljinder Singh @ Babbu. Many people gathered there. Respondent No.1 escaped from the spot. Dinesh Kumar was removed to CMC & H, Ludhiana where he succumbed to the injuries. On statement of his brother Prabhu Dayal the police lodged FIR No.125 dated 26.5.2014 under sections 279/304-A IPC against respondent NO.1 with P.S.Focal Point, Ludhiana. This Truck was owned by respondent No.2 and was insured with respondent No.3. Claimant is mother of deceased and was dependent upon him. She spent about Rs. 50,000/- for last rites of the deceased. It is also averred in the petition that deceased Dinesh Kumar was married with Amita Devi and from this wedlock has a son Tejpal Sharma who is minor. It is also alleged that they were totally dependent upon deceased and due to his untimely death the claimant has suffered great mental agony and loss of source of income. 2 She as well as widow Amita Devi and minor son Tejpal Sharma are the only legal heirs left behind by him. Hence the prayer for granting compensation of Rs. 25 lakhs from respondents. 2.Due notice of petition was given to respondents. Respondent No.1 preferred not to appear and was proceeded against exparte. Respondent No.2 appeared through his counsel and thereafter neither filed written statement nor led any evidence and in last stages of petition he also went unrepresented and was proceeded against exparte. 3.Respondent No.3 Insurance Company appeared and filed written statement raising preliminary objections regarding non-joining of widow and son of deceased in the petition and regarding its maintainability. It also denied remaining version of petition and sought dismissal thereof. 4.No rejoinder was filed by the claimant. 5.From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed:- 1.Whether deceased Dinesh Kumar died due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 while driving Truck bearing No. HR-64-3413?OPP 2.If issue No.1 is proved in affirmative, whether the claimant is entitled to recover the compensation, if so, from which of the respondents and to what amount?OPP. 3.Whether the claim petition is not maintainable in its present form as the same is bad for non-joinder of necessary party? OPR 4.Whether the respondent No.1 was not possessing valid permit and effective driving license?OPR3 5.Relief 6.To prove her version claimant herself deposed as CW1 and also examined eyewitness Prabhu Dayal as CW2 and thereafter remaining 3 evidence of claimant was closed by order of the Tribunal. Ld. Counsel for respondent No.3 tendered copy of insurance policy as Ex RA and then in additional evidence tendered copy of endorsement policy No.84693428 Ex RB and closed its evidence. 7.I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the claimant, learned counsel for appearing respondent and have perused the record. My issue-wise findings are as under: ISSUES NO.1 AND 2. 8.Both these issues are interconnected, and, therefore, are being taken up together for disposal to avoid repetition of discussion. 9.To prove these issues, the claimant Maina Devi deposed as CW1 and in examination-in-chief reiterated the entire version of petition during which course she brought on file a copy of FIR of involved occurrence as EX P1, copy of driving licence of deceased Dinesh Kumar as Ex P2, his death summary Ex P3 issued by the Medical Authority, his employment certificate Ex P4 and copy of RC of referred Moped bearing No. PB-10-DU-4292 as Ex P5. In cross-examination she admitted that she had not seen the alleged occurrence taking place wherein her son Dinesh Kumar suffered fatal injuries. She also could not prove on file any document reflecting employment and quantum of income of deceased except for the document Ex P4. This document purportedly is issued by M/s Ludhiana Bottling Company, Ludhiana but none from said company has been examined to prove authenticity of this document nor any record has been proved on file reflecting that the deceased was ever employed 4 with said company and was earning Rs. 9157/- per month. This CW1 also admitted that she has not brought on file any document which could show that the deceased was a married person and that name of his wife is Amita Devi and they have a minor son Tejpal Sharma. Remaining suggestions were denied by this witness. Other witness examined by claimant is CW2 Prabhu Dayal, the referred eyewitness to the occurrence under reference dated 26.5.2014. In examination-in-chief the entire version of claim petition was reiterated by him verbatim. He categorically stated that due to rash and negligent driving of offending Truck No.HR- 64-3413 by respondent No.1 the collision of this vehicle with Moped No. PB-10-DU-4292 of Dinesh Kumar took place near Punjab and Sind Bank, Mohalla Hira Nagar, Ludhiana resulting in his over running by the offending Truck. The injuries suffered by deceased ultimately proved fatal for him. This witness also stated that he had got lodged FIR Ex P1 in this regard. Copy of postmortem of deceased is mark P on file. In cross- examination also he stood by such version but he too failed to prove on file any document showing that deceased was working as a driver with Ludhiana Bottling Company and was earning Rs. 9157/- per month and that he was married with Amita Devi and had a son Tejpal Sharma as well. He further stated that he had caught the offending driver respondent No.1 at the spot who disclosed his name as Diljinder Singh. Remaining suggestions were denied by this witness as well. This witness categorically stated in such deposition that he had seen the offending driver respondent No.1 at the spot who though mentioned his name as Diljinder Singh but subsequently the petition was got amended by the 5 claimant correcting this name as Baljinder Singh. Mere such difference in name, with almost same phonetic sound, is inconsequential for respondent No.1 whose identity as Baljinder Singh has not been shattered during deposition of this CW2 eyewitness. 10.The depositions of CW1 and CW2 have gone entirely unopposed and uncontested when neither the offending driver respondent No.1 nor the owner of referred offending Truck i.e respondent No.2 dared to contest the proceedings, file the written statement and to depose in court on oath controverting what is stated in petition and is deposed about by these C.Ws. Respondent No.3 insurance company also did not lead any oral evidence and the only piece of evidence brought by it on file is in the shape of a copy of insurance policy as Ex RA and copy of endorsement policy No.84693428 as Ex RB which show that the referred Truck HR- 64-3413 was owned by respondent No.2. 11.In the light of above detailed circumstances, I find that the claimant has been able to prove that due to rash and negligent driving of abovesaid offending Truck, the respondent No.1,who did not dare to contest this petition, had caused the involved collision of this vehicle with above noted Moped of Dinesh Kumar resulting in his death. Copy of his death summary and postmortem report Ex P3 and Mark B are on file. Therefore, respondents No.1 to 3 are liable to compensate the claimant party for death of Dinesh Kumar. 12.Both CW1 and CW2 reiterated on oath before the court that this CW1 is mother of deceased Dinesh Kumar. They also conceded that deceased was married with Amita Devi and from their wedlock one son 6 Tejpal Sharma is born but claimant failed to array them as party in this claim petition. In these circumstances, it appears from the evidence on file that claimant, said Amita Devi and minor son Tejpal Sharma were dependent upon the deceased and are entitled to be compensated by respondents for causing of his death. 13.To prove the quantum of earnings of deceased Dinesh Kumar, the claimant, in addition to oral depositions of CW1 and CW2, also placed on record salary certificate purportedly issued by Ludhiana Bottling Company reflecting his income as Rs.9157/- per month. However, she has failed to prove it as per law as nobody from the said Company was examined to prove it. During cross-examination CW2 also stated that he has not attached any document to show that the deceased was working as driver with Ludhiana Bottling Company. He and CW1 conceded that they have no other document except Ex P4 to show that deceased was earning Rs.9157/- per month. By virtue of such admissions of CW1 and CW2 that they have no proof of payment of any such salary to deceased, and regarding his employment with abovesaid Company, no reliance can be placed on salary certificate Ex P4. In any case, it appears from these circumstances that deceased was fit to earn. His monthly income, therefore, has to be assessed by way of approximation. Same is assessed as Rs. 6,000/- per month. As per Ex P2, copy of driving licence of deceased, his date of birth was 8.5.1983. He was aged about 31 years when the unfortunate accident took place. By virtue of judgment 'Smt.Sarla Verma and others VS. Delhi Transport Corporation and Anr. 2009(3) RCR(Civil) 77 , when the dependents (i.e claimant 7 mother,Amita Devi wife and Tej Pal Sharma, minor son) are three in number, 1/3rd of this monthly income has to be deducted as personal expenses of the deceased. The dependency of claimant and abovesaid Amita Devi and minor son Tej Pal Sharma, therefore, comes to Rs. 4,000/- per month. It annually comes to Rs.48,000/-. By virtue of this Judgment, when deceased was just 31 years old, multiplier of 16 is to be applied. The dependency of claimant,Amita Devi and Tejpal Sharma, therefore, comes out to Rs. 7,68,000/-(Rs.48,000 X 16). In addition to this amount, they would be entitled to Rs. 1 lakh in equal shares as compensation for their suffering of pain and agony and loss of love and affection of deceased. Claimant also is held entitled to Rs. 25,000/- as funeral expenses of deceased. It is made clear that abovesaid Amita Devi and minor son Tej Pal Sharma will receive their shares on proving that they respectively are widow and son of deceased. 14.As a result of above detailed discussion, both these issues are decided in favour of claimant party and against respondents while holding that respondents No.1 to 3 jointly and severally are liable to pay Rs.8,93,000/- to claimant and abovesaid Amita Devi and Tejpal Sharma as detailed above. ISSUE NO.3: 15.By virtue of my findings under issues No. 1 and 2, this petition under Motor Vehicles Act is maintainable as although the petitioner has failed to array widow and minor son of deceased in the claim petition but she has duly mentioned about them in the body of petition. In the circumstances, and in view of my observations and 8 findings recorded under issues No.1 and 2, this issue is decided against respondent No.3 and in favourof claimant. ISSUE NO.4. 16.Onus to prove this issue was upon the respondent No.3. However, it failed to lead any evidence in this regard and also did not press this issue. Consequently, this issue is decided against it and in favour of claimant. ISSUE NO.5 (RELIEF) 17.In the sequel to my findings under aforesaid issues, this claim petition succeeds and the same is hereby allowed with costs. Award of total Rs.8,93,000/-is passed in favour of claimant, widow Amita Devi and minor son Tej Pal Sharma of deceased and against respondents who shall be jointly and severally liable to clear this amount. From this amount, claimant will receive Rs. 2,89,333/- plus Rs. 25,000/- i.e total Rs. 3,14,333/-, whereas abovesaid Amita Devi and Tej Pal Sharma, will receive Rs. 2,89,333/- each. The shares of abovesaid Amita Devi and Tej Pal Sharma are not to be released to them until they prove before court, through some evidence, that they are widow and son of deceased Dinesh Kumar. The claimant party will be entitled to pendente lite and future interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum on the awarded amount , from the date of filing of this petition till actual realization. S ince respondent no.3 being insurance company had agreed to indemnify respondents no.1 & 2 against all third party claims, it is the respondent no.3 who shall meet the abovesaid. liability by making the payment. 9 18.Counsel fee is assessed at Rs.1100/-.

Respondent no.2 tendered copy of verification 4 Dogar Singh etc. Vs. Johny Vaid etc. report of R.C. Ex.R2 and respondent no.3 tendered insurance policy Ex.R1. 11.I have heard the arguments and gone through the file carefully. My issue-wise findings are as under:- ISSUE NO.1 12.The onus to prove this issue was upon the claimants. In order to prove this issue, the claimants have examined Dogar Singh husband of the deceased as PW1 and he deposed that on 5.4.2014 the deceased alongwith the deponent had gone to their fields and after doing work, they were coming back to their house on foot. The deceased was ahead of the witness and when the deceased was about to cross the road from the side of Village Daheru towards the side of her house situated at Village Mohanpur at G.T. Road, the offending motorcycle bearing registration No.DL-9SAQ-1709 being driven by respondent no.1 in rash and negligent manner and at a very high speed came from Ludhiana side towards Khanna side and struck against the deceased due to which she fell down and sustained multiple and grievous injuries on her head. He further deposed that thereafter, she succumbed to her injuries at Apollo Hospital, Ludhiana and FIR no.45 dated 6.4.2014 was got registered at PS Sadar Khanna for offences u/Ss 279, 304-A IPC.

The claimants have also proved on record certified copy of FIR Ex.P2, certified copy of final report submitted by the police after investigation finding respondent no.1 guilty of causing the death by rash or negligent 5 Dogar Singh etc. Vs. Johny Vaid etc. driving as Ex.P1 and Ex.P3 is copy of the post mortem report showing that deceased Jarnail Kaur died due to motor vehicular accident. There is no rebuttal to evidence by respondent no.1, so adverse inference is to be drawn against him. So, it is proved that on 5.4.2014 Jarnail Kaur wife of Dogar Singh died in a road side accident in the area of Village Daheru caused by rash and negligent driving of motorcycle make Pulsar bearing registration No.DL-9SAQ-1709 by respondent no.1.

Respondent no.2 has produced on record Ex.P2 copy of verification report of Registering Authority showing that the vehicle was duly registered with the Registering Authority. Respondent no.3 has led no evidence to rebut the same. So, this issue is also decided in against the respondent no.3 and in favour of respondents no.1 & 2. ISSUE NO.2 6 Dogar Singh etc. Vs. Johny Vaid etc. 15.The onus to prove this issue was upon the claimants. Claimants claimed 30 lacs as compensation on the ground that the ₹ deceased was 65 years of age and used to keep buffaloes and was selling milk and was helping claimant no.1 in agriculture work and her monthly income was 10,000/-. ₹ 16.So far as the age of the deceased is concerned, as per the post mortem report Ex.P3, the age of the deceased is recorded to be 65 years and there is no evidence on record that the deceased was doing the dairy farming. So, she was a household lady. The counsel for the claimants has relied upon the law laid down by Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in Dal Chand and others Vs. Samsudin and others, FAO 764 of 2012 (O&M) decided on 25.10.2016 , where in it was held as under :- “The deceased was a young energetic woman and there was abrupt termination of her life. There is nothing on record suggestive of the fact that the deceased was suffering from any ailment rendering her unable to perform household duties besides giving love, care and protection to her children. Under these circumstances, notional income of the deceased is assessed at ₹7000/- per month. There would not be any deduction in the light of a Division Bench judgment of this court Paramjit Singh and another Vs. Dilbagh Singh alias Bagga and others, 2014(4) RCR (Civil) 895.” 17.Learned counsel for the claimants argued that monthly income of the deceased be taken as 7000/- as per the judgment of ₹ Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court, whereas the counsel for the respondents argued that in this case notional income of the deceased be taken as 3000/- per month. ₹ 7 Dogar Singh etc. Vs. Johny Vaid etc. 18.There is no reasonable nexus to assess the income of the deceased as 3000/- per month, but considering the fact that in the ₹ present case, the deceased was a lady of advanced age of 65 years, whereas in the case cited above, the lady was quite young and energetic and she was providing care and protection to her children, whereas in the present case the children are self sufficient, so, the income of the deceased is taken notionally at 5000/- per month and after applying the multiplier ₹ of 7, the dependency comes to ( 5000/- x 12 x 7) 4,20,000/-. Claimant ₹ ₹ no.1 Dogar Singh is also awarded an amount of 50,000/- on account of ₹ loss of consortium. A sum of 25,000/- is awarded to the claimants on ₹ account of funeral expenses and a sum of 25,000/- each is awarded to ₹ claimants no.2 to 4 on account of loss of love and affection. As such, the total amount of compensation comes to ₹5,70,000/-. 19.Since, respondent no.1 was the driver of the offending vehicle, which was owned by respondent no.2 and was insured with respondent no.3, therefore, all the respondents are liable to pay the amount of compensation to the claimants jointly as well as severally. So, this issue is decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. RELIEF 20. As a result of discussion and findings on issues, supra, the claim petition succeeds and is hereby allowed with costs and compensation to the tune of ₹5,70,000/- is awarded in favour of the claimants and against respondents no.1 to 3, who shall pay this amount of compensation jointly as well as severally to the claimants within a period of two months from today alongwith interest @ 7% per annum from the 8 Dogar Singh etc. Vs. Johny Vaid etc. date of accident till its realization, failing which the amount of compensation shall carry interest @ 9% per annum. Out of the amount of compensation of ₹5,70,000/-, ₹50,000/- is payable to claimant no.1 and ₹25,000/- each to claimants no.2 to 4 individually. The remaining amount of compensation of ₹4,45,000/- is apportioned amongst the claimants as under :- 1-Claimant no.1(Dogar Singh) - 40% 2-Claimants no.2 to 4 - 20% each (Kulwinder Singh, Rajinder Singh & Daljit Singh) 21.It is also ordered that the amount of compensation be deposited directly into the bank accounts of the respective claimants on their furnishing bank account details.

A W A R D This award of mine shall dispose of petition filed by claimant Jashanpreet Singh on account of injuries received by him in a road accident, 1 occurred on 03.04.2015. 2.In brief, the case of claimant, as set out in his claim petition, is that on 03.04.2015, claimant alongwith his uncle Rupinder Singh and cousin Akashpreet Singh was going from Mandi Ahmedgarh to Ludhiana in his Santro Car bearing registration No.PB-11-T-5647. At about 8.15 p.m, when they had reached near bridge of village Gopalpur, one bus bearing registration No.PB-10- CR-9928 (hereinafter called the offending vehicle for the sake of brevity) came from behind. It struck against car of claimant due to which all occupants of car received injuries. Claimant has spent huge amount on his treatment and as such, he is entitled to recovery of Rs.15 Lakh alongwith interest from the respondents. 3.Upon issuance of notice of the claim petition to the respondents, they put in appearance and contested claim of claimant. Respondents No.1 in his written statement, raised preliminary objections with respect to maintainability of petition, cause of action and falsehood of claimant. On merits, respondent No.1 submitted that he has been falsely implicated in this case just to put pressure upon him and to extract some money from him and as such, claimant is not entitled for any claim. Respondent No.1 further claimed that he can not be held liable for accident and as such, petition is liable to be dismissed. 4.Respondent No.2, in its separate written statement has raised preliminary objection that it has not been impleaded in its correct name and through its authorized officer. There is no transport corporation by the name of Punjab Roadways Transport Corporation. The present petition is not maintainable as Sh. Pawan Kumar son of Sh. Prem Chand Sharma, the registered owner of Bus No.PB-10-CR-9928 and its insurer, have not been impleaded who 1 are necessary parties for the just decision of the case. Respondent No.2 has claimed that registered owner of Bus No.PB-10CR-9928 i.e. Sh. Pawan Kumar son of Prem Chand Sharma has entered into a lease agreement with the it (respondent No.2) on 08.09.2009 for a period of five years for leasing out four buses including the offending vehicle. Accordingly, only the registered owner and insurer of this Bus are liable for all or any violation of provisions of Motor Vehicle Act and rules framed there under. As such, respondent No.2 has no connection or concern for any liability arising out of offending vehicle. It is comprehensively insured with the National Insurance Company Ltd., G.T. Road, Khanna. On merits, respondent No.2 denied most of contents of the claim petition for want of knowledge. It claimed that claimant is not entitled to any amount as compensation from it and his petition is liable to be dismissed. 5.Respondent No.3 (Insurance company) in its separate written statement, has raised preliminary objections with respect to maintainability of petition; non joinder and mis joinder of necessary parties; validity of driving licence of respondent No.1, negligence of respondent No.1, validity of registration certificate, violation of terms of insurance policy etc. On merits, respondent No.3 has denied almost all the allegations of the claim petition for want of knowledge. It is admitted that the Bus PRTC No.PB-10CR-9928 was insured at the time of alleged accident. However, it has claimed that no accident has taken place, as alleged by claimant. It submitted that respondent No.3 is not liable to be indemnify loss, if any, suffered by the claimant. Lastly, the respondent No.3 also prayed for dismissal of claim petition. 6.Respondents No.4 in his written statement, raised preliminary 1 objections with respect to maintainability of petition, locus standi of claimant to file petition, cause of action and falsehood of claimant. On merits, respondent No.4 submitted that the vehicle of the respondent No.4 has been falsely implicated in the present case and as such, he is not liable to pay any compensation amount. No such accident has ever taken place with the vehicle of the respondent No.4 and as such, petition is liable to be dismissed . 7.From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed: 1.Whether the claimant received injuries in the accident caused by respondent No.1 by rash and negligent driving of bus bearing No.PB-10CR-9928? OPP 2.If issue No.1 is proved in affirmative, whether the claimant is entitled for compensation, if so, to what amount and from whom? OPP 3.Whether the claim petition is not maintainable? OPR 4.Whether the claim petition is bad for non joinder and misjoinder of necessary parties? OPR 5.Whether the respondent No.1 was not having any valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident, if so its effect? OPR 6.Whether the bus bearing No.PB-10CR-9938 did not have the valid registration certificate, route permit and fitness certificate at the time of alleged accident,if so its effect? OPR 7.Relief. 8. In order to prove his case, the claimant himself appeared as CW-1 and examined Clerk-cum-Computer Operator, Dayanand Hospital, Ludhiana Prince (PW-2), Gaurav Singla (PW-3) and Dr. Saurav Singla (PW-4). 9.On the other hand, respondents No.1 and 2 examined Sub Inspector Davinder Kumar (RW-1) and proved documents i.e. Lease agreement Ex.RW-1/1 1 and Ex.RW-1/2 and Annexure-A(Terms and conditions) as Ex.RW-1/3, attested photocopy of insurance poly Ex.RW-1/4, attested copy of route permit Ex.RW- 1/5 and attested copy of driving licence of respondent No.1 Ex.RW-1/6, attested copy of fitness certificate Ex.RW-1/7 and copy of RC of Bus No.PB-10CR-9928 as Ex.RW1/8 on record. 10.Learned counsel for the respondent No.3 tendered into evidence original verification report alongwith bill and certified copy of Insurance policy Ex.R1 and Ex.R2, before closing evidence. 11.I have heard Learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the file, very carefully and minutely. My issue-wise findings on the above issues are as under : ISSUE NO.1 12.In order to establish on record that claimant has suffered injuries in accident in question, which was caused by rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1, the complainant has heavily relied upon his own deposition as CW-1. 13.From the perusal of deposition of Jashanpreet Singh (CW-1), it transpires that he has specifically deposed that accident has occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 while driving of offending vehicle. Learned counsel for respondents have cross-examined this witness at considerable length, but nothing material extracted from his deposition that could be of any help to respondents either to disprove the manner of accident or to shatter testimony of this witness. 14.It is evident on record that FIR with respect to accident in question was registered against respondent No.1 and he is facing criminal trial after 1 conclusion of investigation by police. Till date, respondent No.1 has not approached higher police authorities with respect to his alleged false implication in criminal case. Moreover, respondent No.1, who could have been the best witness to rebut the evidence of the claimant, has not come into witness box. This tribunal is bound to draw adverse inference against him to the extent that his defence raised in written statement is not correct. In the opinion of this tribunal, the silence on the part of respondent, for such a long time, in itself is sufficient to prove that he was negligent, in driving the offending vehicle, at the relevant time, as a result thereof, the accident took place, leading to causing of injuries to claimant. This opinion of the Tribunal is also fortified by judgment reported as 2008 (1) PLR 444 titled as Sudama Devi and others Vs. Kewal Ramand others. The relevant extract of this judgment is also reproduced hereunder : “11. It was next contended by the learned counsel for the appellant, in this appeal, that from the evidence of Sat Pal, RW-1, who was the conductor of the bus, at the relevant time, it was proved that the driver thereof was neither rash nor negligence. He stated, in his statement, that the bus was at a slow speed. During he cross-examination, it was submitted by him, that a criminal case under Section 304-A I.P .C was registered against the driver of the bus, and he was facing trial therein. Even Kewal Ram, RW-2, driver of the husband himself admitted that he was arrested at the spot. In case, Kewal Ram was not negligent in driving the bus, at the time of accident, resulting into the death of Chander Wali, he could make a statement before the police officials, in that regard. In case, the police officials of the concerned police station, were not ready to hear him, then he could certainly approach the higher police authorities, that he 1 had been falsely implicated, in a criminal case, and the accident did not take place, on account of his rash and negligent act. He could also move an application, before his higher officers, that he was not at fault, but the accident took place, on account of the negligent act of Chander Wali. He, however, did not do so, and kept mum. His mere silence for a long time, in itself is sufficient to prove that he was negligent, in driving the bus, at the relevant time, as a result thereof, the accident took place, leading to the death of Chander Wali. The statements of Sat Pal, RW-1 and Kewal Ram, RW-2, were rightly disbelieved by the Tribunal. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant, being without merit, must fail and the same stands rejected. The findings of the Tribunal on issue No.1 being correct are affirmed” . 15.On the basis of discussion held in preceding paragraph of this judgment, this tribunal has no other option except to hold that claimants has successfully proved on record that he has suffered injuries in motor vehicular accident dated 03.04.2015, which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. Hence, this issue is decided in favour of claimant and against respondents. ISSUES NO.2, 4 TO 6 16.All these issues are being taken up together for the purpose of discussion and decision to avoid unnecessary repetition of facts and evidence. Moreover, these issues are interlinked. 17.By way of present claim petition, the claimant has claimed that he has spent huge amount on his treatment. Claimant has examined Prince (PW-2), who is Clerk-cum-Computer Operator, Dayanand Medical Hospital, Ludhiana and Gaurav Singla (PW-3), who have produced on record with respect to medical 1 treatment of claimant. Dr.Saurav Singla (PW-4) has also deposed with respect to treatment of claimant and has further deposed that complainant had suffered disability to the extent of 20%. Learned counsel for the respondents have cross- examination all these witnesses at considerable length but nothing material extracted from their respective deposition that could be of any help to respondents either to disprove the manner of accident or to shatter testimony of these witnesses or that witnesses are deposing falsely. From the bills (Ex.P5 to Ex.P46 and Ex.PW3/2 to Ex.P3/14), it transpires that claimant has spent Rs.85027/- on his treatment. Resultantly, this court is of the opinion that claimant is entitled to repayment of said amount. No doubt, Dr. Saurav Singla (PW-4) has deposed that claimant has also suffered disability to the extent of 20%, but as the said disability is temporary one and the claimant himself has admitted in his cross-examination that he is O.Kay now after accident, thus, this court is of the opinion that further compensation on account of disability is not warranted in this case. However, keeping in view, the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case and discussion held in preceding paragraphs of this judgment, this Tribunal is of the considered opinion that apart from amount of expenditure incurred on treatment, the claimant is also entitled to lumpsum compensation on account of injuries, pain and sufferings and special diet, the details of which is as under : INJURY CASE Age in years 23 Sr. No. Head of Claim Amount 1. Medical expenses Rs.85,047/- 2. Pain suffering Rs.10,000/- 3. Special diet Rs.10,000/- 1 4. TOTAL Rs.1,05,047/- 18. In view of my above discussion, the claimant is held entitled to get compensation of Rs.1,05,047/- . Now the only question, which remains to be adjudicated is that whether all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay this amount or not, because respondent No.3 has claimed that it is not liable to indemnify loss suffered by the claimant, as respondent No.3 has claimed in this case that it is not liable to indemnify loss if any suffered by claimant because firstly, the petition is bad for non joinder and mis-joinder of the parties and secondly, the vehicle was being plied in contravention of insurance policy. On the other hand, respondent No.2 has claimed that no compensation can be allowed against it, because the offending vehicle was simply on lease with it and only registered owner and its insurance company can be liable in view of the lease agreements (Ex.RW1/1 and Ex. RW1/2). 19. So far as claim of respondent No.3 with respect to joinder of the parties is concerned, it is relevant to mention here that all necessary parties have been arrayed as respondents in this case. Not only registered owner, but insurance company of offending vehicle, has also been arrayed besides driver and Pepsu Road Transport Corporation (PRTC). Moreover, during course of arguments, Learned counsel for the respondents have failed to point out the party who has either been left out or has been necessarily arrayed in this case. Resultantly, this court does not find any contention to the effect that petition is bad for non-joinder and mis-joinder of necessary parties. 20. Respondent No.1 has placed and proved on record his driving licence as Ex.RW1/6, whereas on the other hand, insurance policy of the offending vehicle has been proved on record as Ex.RW1/4. These documents show that driving licence of respondent No.1 and insurance were valid on the date of accident. Respondent No.2 has 1 also placed and proved on record route permit (Ex.RW1/5) vide which the vehicle was being plied at the time of accident. The arguments of Learned counsel for the respondent No.3 that respondent No.2 was not competent to run the offending bus on permit (Ex.RW1/5) in view of the provision contained in Section 82 of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, has failed to attract this court, because in the present case, the permit of vehicle has not been transferred. Rather; vehicle of respondent No.4 has been taken on lease by respondent No.2 for plying on valid permit. Judgment passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case M.S. Middle High School Vs. HDFC Ergo General Insurance Co. Ltd. & Ors. is not applicable to the facts of the present case. Hence, it is not avail to respondent No.3. The arguments of Learned counsel for respondent No.2 that respondent No.2 cannot be burdened with any liability, is not attracted in this case, because there is no specific clause in lease agreements (Ex.RW1/1, Ex.RW1/2 and Ex.RW1/3) to the effect that only liability would be of registered owner or Insurance Company if vehicle if met with an accident. Clause No.7 of the lease agreement, upon which the reliance has been placed by counsel for the respondent No.2, is attracted in case of invalid driving licence of driver of the vehicle, which is not so in the present case. Accordingly, it can not be said that respondent No.2 or 3 are not liable to pay compensation amount alongwith respondents No.1 and 4, who are driver and owner, respectively, of offending vehicle. 21.On the basis of discussion held in above paragraphs of this judgment, it is held that the liability to pay the awarded compensation amount of the respondents No.1 to 4 would be joint and several. Thus, all these issues are decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondents to the extent that claimant is entitled to recover Rs.1,05,047/- from respondents, jointly and severally. 1 ISSUE No.3 22.No arguments were addressed by counsel for the parties on this issue. As the present claim petition has been filed for realizing amount of compensation on account of accident, which has been proved on record, it can not be said that petition is not maintainable. Moreover, this issue has not been pressed, during arguments. Hence, this issue is decided in favour of claimant and against the respondents. ISSUE No.7 (RELIEF): 23.In view of findings of this Tribunal of above issues, the present claim petition filed under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 by the claimant, is partly allowed with costs, and award to the tune of Rs.1,05,047/- with interest @ 9% per annum, from the date of filing of petition till its realization, as compensation on account of suffering of injuries, is passed in favour of claimant and against the respondents No.1 to 4. The liability to pay the awarded compensation amount shall be of all respondents will be joint and several, however, the first liability would be of the respondent No.3 being insurer of offending vehicle. Counsel's fee is assessed to be Rs.1000/-. Memo of costs be prepared. File be consigned to the Record Room. Announced in open Court. 02.01.2018.

I have heard arguments advanced by learned counsel for the parties and have also gone through the record. My findings on above said issues are, as under: Issue no.1. 6. In order to prove his case, CW1 Jagroop Singh petitioner appeared in the witness box and made statement vide his affidavit Ex.CA. He further brought on record documents Ex.C1 to Ex.C43. CW2 Avtar Singh, eyewitness of the accident, made statement vide his affidavit Ex.CB. CW3 Gurjant Singh, Assistant Manager, Sidhu Hospital Private Limited, Doraha proved documents Ex.C1, Ex.C3 to Ex.C7, Ex.C12, Ex.C15, Ex.C17 to Ex.C41 and Ex.C44. From the statements of CW1 Jagroop Singh petitioner/injured and CW2 Avtar Singh, eyewitness of the accident, it is made out that on 3.09.2014, Kala, resident of Village Katani had come to village of the petitioner due to fair of Guga Peer and in the evening, the petitioner went to drop Kala at his house. At about 7:30 PM, the petitioner reached Village Pipli and the offending tractor alongwith Jagroop Singh Vs. Sarabjit Singh 9 MACP/353/2015. trolley being driven by respondent No.1 Sarabjit Singh came from the side of the village. Right side headlight of the tractor was not working and only its left side of the head light was working. The offending tractor hit in motorcycle of the petitioner and he fell down. His motorcycle was badly damaged and he suffered injuries on his right ankle, right wrist and other parts of the body. His two fingers were broken. This accident was witnessed by Avtar Singh son of Hira Singh, resident of Village Lall Kalan, who got him admitted to Sidhu Hospital, Doraha and gave information to the police and FIR No.206 dated 6.09.2014, under Section 279, 337, 338, 427 of the Indian Penal Code, Police Station Samrala was registered. Ex.C2 is a copy of the FIR registered against respondent No.1 Sarabjit Singh driver of offending tractor for causing the accident in question due to rash and negligent driving. Further Ex.C1 is copy of medico legal report of the petitioner showing that the petitioner remained admitted to Sidhu Hospital, Doraha on 3.09.2014 due to the injuries suffered in the road traffic accident. Ex.C3 is discharge summary showing that he remained admitted in the said hospital from 3.11.2014 to 4.11.2014 and skin grafting was done. Ex.C4 is OPD slip dated 26.09.2014, Ex.C5 is OPD Slip dated 3.11.2014, Ex.C6 is OPD Slip dated 30.01.2015 and Ex.C7 to Ex.C41 are the bills showing that Rs.91,783/- were spent on medical treatment of the petitioner. Further Ex.C44 is discharge summary showing that the petitioner remained admitted to Sidhu Hospital from 3.09.2014 to 18.09.2014. 7. So, the version of CW1 Jagroop Singh petitioner finds corroboration from the statement of CW2 Avtar Singh as well as documents Ex.C1 to Ex.C41 and it is proved that on 3.09.2012 at 7:30 PM, in the area of Lall Kalan, respondent No.1 Sarabjit Singh by driving the offending tractor make Johndere 5050 E bearing Engine No.PY3029T- 1924TS, Chassis No.PY3090EA0A001502, in a rash and negligent manner, caused the accident resulting in multiple grevious injuries on the person of petitioner. Although, it is the case of respondent No.1 that neither he ever drove the offending tractor in a rash and negligent manner nor caused the accident in question, but no evidence was led by the respondent to rebut Jagroop Singh Vs. Sarabjit Singh 9 MACP/353/2015. the above discussed evidence brought on record by the petitioner. Even, respondent No.1 Sarabjit Singh himself did not step into the witness box to prove averments of the written statement. Therefore, I have no hesitation to hold that the petitioner has succeeded in proving that on 3.09.2014 at about 7:30 PM in the area of Village Lall Kalan, respondent No.1 Sarabjit Singh by driving the offending tractor in rash and negligent manner, caused accident resulting in multiple grevious injuries on the person of the petitioner. Hence, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioner. ISSUES NO.2 AND 3 : 8. Both these issues are interconnected and hence are taken up together in order to avoid repetition of discussion. CW1 Jagroop Singh petitioner is of age 36 years and he was working as driver and was earning Rs.8000/- per month. Further, he was doing agriculture and keeping 7/8 buffaloes and his total income was Rs.20,000/- per month. However, there is no documentary showing his income. Hence, keeping in view the nature of his job, his income is assess at Rs.15,000/- per month He had worked as driver in Dubai. Ex.C42 is copy of his international driving license and Ex.C43 is copy of his Passport. Due to the multiple grievous injuries suffered in the accident, he remained admitted in hospital from 3.09.2014 to 18.09.2014 and from 3.11.2014 to 4.11.2014 i.e. for 18 days, as is evident from medico legal report and discharge summary Ex.C1, Ex.C3 and Ex.C44. Further Rs.91,783/-were spent on his medical treatment as is evident from the bills Ex.C7 to Ex.C41. He remained under treatment for about four months as is evident from the OPD slips Ex.C4 to Ex.C6. He had undergone pain and suffering due to the multiple grievous injuries and skin grafting operation. Therefore, keeping in view all these above said facts, the petitioner is held entitled to compensation, as under:- INJURY CASE Age 32 years Period of hospitalization 18 days (from 3.09.2014 to Jagroop Singh Vs. Sarabjit Singh 9 MACP/353/2015. 18.09.2014 and from 3.11.2014 to 4.11.2014 ) Occupation and income Driver/Agriculture/Dairy Farming, Rs.15,000/- per month.

In my findings on issue No.1, I have already held that multiple grievous injuries was suffered by the petitioner in motor vehicle accident caused due to the rash and negligent driving of th offending tractor by respondent No.1Sarabjit Singh . The offending tractor is owned by respondent No.2 Lakhbir Singh, who has not come forward to contest this petition and he has been proceeded against exparte. The respondents have not brought on record any insurance certificate showing that offending tractor was duly insured. There is nothing on record showing that this petition is not maintainable. Therefore, the petitioner is entitled to get compensation of Rs.1,87,000/- from the respondents, jointly and severally and issue No.2 is decided in favour of petitioner accordingly and issue No. 3 is decided against the respondent. ISSUE NO.7 (RELIEF): 10.In view of the findings on the above said issues, this petition is allowed with costs in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents.

D.R.Rampal, Advocate for respondent No.3. 1 AWARD This petition under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 has been filed by claimants seeking compensation from respondents on account of death of Rahul Kumar, in a motor vehicular accident, caused by respondent No.2 by driving rashly and negligently Tanker No. GJ-12AT-5251 in the intervening night of 12-13.6.2015 in the area of Ludhiana-Khanna G.T.Road, Doraha. 2.Claimants averred in the petition that Rahul Kumar was just aged 26 years. Claimants No.1 and 2 are his father and mother; claimant No.3 is his widow while claimants No.4 and 5 are his daughter and son. Rahul Kumar was hale and hearty and was working with M/s Soma and Company which was constructing National Highway. For this purpose Rahul Kumar was employed by M/s Louis Berger Consulting Private Ltd., B-3-6, Sector-32, Gurgaon (Haryana) and such employment he was earning Rs. 18,900/- per month. In the intervening night of 12-13.6.2015 Rahul Kumar was sleeping in his rented house situate in Main Bazar, Doraha. Above referred Tanker No. GJ-12AT-5251 was passing through Ludhiana- Khanna G.T.Road. At about 11.30 PM on 12.6.2015 it crossed the Canal Bridge, Doraha. There was an over bridge on the road. Respondent No.2 driver did not bother to assess the height of the over bridge. He did not slow down the vehicle and tried to pass through that over bridge negligently. Upper portion of Tanker hit the over bridge. That portion of Tanker was damaged. This vehicle was loaded with Ammonia Gas which started leaking. Passersby and other persons sleeping or residing in the surrounding area were badly affected by this leaked gas. 2 About 150 persons suffered deadly problems. They included Rahul Kumar and Satpal Moker as well. These affected persons were taken to various hospitals for treatment. Fire-brigade people controlled the leakage of gas after putting in efforts of 7/8 hours. Due to said inhaling of the gas, Rahul Kumar died on 13.6.2015. His postmortem was conducted at Civil Hospital, Ludhiana on 14.6.2015. Rahul Kumar was earning Rs. 18,900/- per month as stated above. This income was to increase day by day. Claimants were entirely dependant upon him. They also had to spend Rs. 80,000/- on transportation and performing of last rites of deceased. Involved Tanker is owned by respondent No.1 and was insured with respondent No.3. All respondents, therefore, are liable to compensate claimants for loss occurred to them due to untimely death of Rahul Kumar. They have prayed for compensation of Rs. 50 lakhs with interest in the petition. 3.On notice, the respondent No.1 appeared and filed its detailed written statement admitting that the referred Tanker No. GJ-12-AT-5251 is owned by it and was insured with respondent No.3. However, it denied remaining entire version of petition and sought its dismissal. 4.Originally the claimants impleaded Jagmohan Singh son of Sant Singh as driver respondent No.2 who also filed written statement reiterating the stand taken by respondent No.1 in its written statement. However, subsequently, both these respondents No.1 and 2 went unrepresented and were proceeded against exparte. 5.Respondent No.3 Insurance Company appeared on notice and filed its detailed written statement wherein it took preliminary objections 3 that the petition is bad for non-joinder of parties and that this petition is not maintainable against this respondent. On merits also it controverted the pleadings of petition and prayed for its dismissal. 6.On application of claimants the driver respondent No.2 was replaced by Jatindra Singh @ Jatinder Singh. Notice to him was issued but in due course the claimants withdrew this petition qua him. It was dismissed qua respondent No.2 accordingly. 7.On pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed on 6.10.2016:- 1.Whether deceased Rahul Kumar died in a Motor Vehicular accident caused by respondent No.2, while driving offending vehicle bearing No. GJ-12-AT-5251 in rash and negligent manner, in the area of Doraha, in the intervening night of 12/13.6.2015?OPA 2.Whether the claimants are entitled to compensation, if so from whom and to what extent?OPA 3.Whether the claim petition is not maintainable?OPR 4.Whether the claim petition is bad for mis-joinder and non-joinder of necessary parties?OPR 5.Whether the claimants are estopped by their act and conduct from filing claim petition?OPP 6.Whether the offending driver and owner of offending vehicle did not have valid transport documents at the time of alleged accident?OPR(3) 7.Relief. 8.In their evidence claimants examined claimant No.1 Ajay Kumar as CW1, MMHC Jarnail Singh as CW2, eyewitness Aditya Kumar as CW3, official from the Employer Company of deceased i.e. Harish Kumar Sethi as CW4, tendered certified copy of report under section 4 173(2) Cr.P.C as Ex C4, and copy of postmortem report of deceased Rahul Kumar as Ex C5 before closing their evidence. 9.Respondent No.3 tendered copy of insurance policy Ex R1, copy of RC of offending vehicle Tanker GJ-12-AT-5251 Ex R2, receipt Ex R3, fitness verification report Ex R4, report Ex R5, copy of permit Ex R6, document Ex R7, recovery memo regarding taking into possession driving licence of respondent No. 2 Ex R8 and verification report EX R9 before closing its evidence. 10.I have heard the arguments of learned counsel for the claimants, learned counsel for appearing respondents and have perused the record. My issue-wise findings are as under: ISSUES NO.1 AND 2. 11.Both these issues are interconnected, and, therefore, are being taken up together for disposal to avoid repetition of discussion. 12.To prove these issues, claimants have examined above noted four C.Ws out of whom claimant No.1 Ajay Kumar is CW1. He is father of deceased Rahul Kumar. In his examination-in-chief he reiterated the version of petition concisely while detailing out the relationship of claimants with deceased and further that the deceased was just 26 years old at the time of his death. He was working with M/s Soma & Company which was constructing National Highway. Deceased was earning Rs. 18,900/- per month. He also asserted that this income was to increase periodically and further that the claimants were entirely dependant upon deceased on whose performing of last rites etc. the claimants had spent 5 Rs. 80,000/-. In cross-examination, however, he conceded that he had not seen the alleged occurrence taking place. He himself is an agriculturist by profession. He owns and cultivates 3 acres land in this regard in District Patna, Bihar. He conceded that he is physically fit (he is aged just 45 years) and himself is attending his agricultural work. Remaining suggestions were denied by him while admitting that he has no proof of having spent Rs. 80,000/- on performing of last rites of deceased. CW2 is MMHC Jarnail Singh from P.S. Doraha who proved a copy of FIR No.88 dated 13.6.2015 lodged in the said Police Station, qua offence under section 304-A IPC relating to the occurrence, subject matter of current petition as well, wherein above noted Tanker NO. GJ-12-AT-5251 was involved. His cross-examination is formal. CW3 is eyewitness Aditya Kumar. He belongs to Village Aur, Tehsil and Distt. S.B.S.Nagar (Nawanshar). As per his deposition, his parents-in-law are based in Doraha, Distt. Ludhiana. He stated that on 12.6.2015 he had gone to his In-laws place in Doraha. On the way, on Ludhiana-Khanna G.T. Road, he noticed abovesaid Tanker No. GJ-12-At-5251 being driven in rash and negligent manner at about 11.30 PM. At that time this Tanker was crossing the over bridge constructed on the road. Respondent No.2 failed to anticipate the height of the over bridge. He did not slow down the vehicle and negligently tried to take it through that bridge. The upper portion of Tanker consequently hit the over bride damaging the upper portion of Tanker wherein Ammonia Gas was being carried. It started leaking out. The passersby and other persons sleeping or residing in the surrounding area were badly affected by inhaling of this gas. 5 persons 6 including Rahul Kumar and Satpal Moker died. Another about 150 persons were also badly affected who were taken to different hospitals for treatment. The leakage of gas from abovesaid said Tanker could be controlled by the Fire-brigade people after putting in strenuous efforts of over 7-8 hours. Rahul Kumar had died on 13.6.2015 due to inhaling of gas. His postmortem was conducted at Civil Hospital, Ludhiana on 14.6.2015. CW3 further stated that his statement was recorded by the police as well but the FIR was lodged on the statement of Vijay Kumar. Cross-examination of this CW3 though reveals that he had no document to prove that he was in Doraha on the fateful day and time. He came on a Motorcycle from his Village to Doraha but he does not remember the registration number of that vehicle. He though conceded that at the time of occurrence he was sitting at the house of his in-laws situate about 500 meters from the place of occurrence. He too had suffered Ammonia Gas effects but he did not seek any medical treatment. He also had not seen the offending driver. Remaining suggestions were denied by him. CW4 examined by claimants is Harish Kumar Sethi, Office Coordinator, from Louis Berger Consulting Pvt. Ltd. He appeared with relevant record and deposed in his examination-in-chief that Rahul Kumar (deceased) was appointed with said company w.e.f 1.11.2012 as a Lab Assistant and his gross salary was Rs. 17,500/- per month. Copy of his appointment letter is Ex C1 and copy of his PAN card is Ex C2. Cross-examination of this witness is formal, bookish and explanatory in nature where he explained that the Employer Company maintains the Wages Register and other record. Remaining suggestions were denied by him. 7 13.It is argued by Ld. Counsel for claimants that the eyewitness account regarding the referred occurrence has come on file through the deposition of CW3. Copy of report under section 173(2) Cr.P.C pertaining to this occurrence is Ex C4 and copy of FIR attached with the same shows that it though was lodged on the statement of Vijay Kumar but this CW3 also was a witness to the occurrence. He also had suffered effects of inhaling of Ammonia Gas from the involved Tanker. This CW3 also had suffered statement before the police. Mere fact that FIR was not lodged on his statement cannot have any bearing on the matter. More over, he is not related to claimants or deceased in any manner. In Judgment Somari Devi and others Vs. Ragwar Singh and others, 2011 ACJ 1475 the Hon'ble Delhi High Court held that statement of eyewitness and documents clearly proved the taking place of occurrence. The name of eyewitness (like CW3) being not in FIR does not mean that his deposition could not be taken into account. Otherwise also the lodging of mere FIR proves the taking place of occurrence. Another Judgment Girdhari lal Vs Radhey Sham,1993(2) PLR 109 holds that the FIR is a strong circumstance that accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of the driver. On the other hand Ld. Counsel for Insurance Company respondent No.3 argued that this respondent is not liable to indemnify other respondents as the Tanker owner was required to draw insurance policy under the Public Liability Insurance Act,1991 when the offending Tanker was carrying hazardous substance i.e Ammonia Gas. Fact remains that said policy could be drawn by the owner/respondent No.1. No public in general would be in the know that the Tanker was 8 carrying some hazardous substance. Otherwise also the Tanker had hit the roof of over bridge. It could not take place had its driver been cautious and could assess the height of roof of the bridge before crossing the same. He misjudged it resulting in hitting of the top portion of Tanker with the roof of over bridge. The Tanker admittedly was carrying Ammonia Gas, which, as is a fact of common knowledge, is a poisonous substance. In Judgments New India Assurance Co. Ltd., Appellant vs. Biman Prasad Barkakati and others,2009 ACJ 974 and United India Insurance Co. Ltd., vs. Janki Devi and others, 2013 ACJ 1509 it is held that if the offending vehicle was carrying an inflammable and hazardous substance at the time of accident and the accident had taken place, the insurance company is liable to pay the compensation. In these circumstances, the non-drawing of insurance policy by the owner of involved Tanker i.e respondent No.1 under the Public Liability Insurance Act,1991 has no consequence so far as the claim of claimants is concerned. 13.The uncontrovrted depositions of CW1 Ajay Kumar, of CW3 eyewitness Aditya Kumar, contents of abovesaid FIR, of report under section 173(2) Cr.P.C Ex C4 and postmortem report Ex C5 all show that Rahul Kumar had died by 3.15 AM on 13.6.2015. This postmortem report Ex C5 also shows that the death had taken place due to inhaling of poisonous substance/gas by him. This piece of evidence also has remaining unchallenged by the appearing respondent. The death of Rahul Kumar, therefore, is attributable to the rash and negligent driving of abovesaid Tanker belonging to respondent No.1, as it was carrying 9 poisonous Ammonia Gas and had hit the over bridge causing its leakage, which admittedly was insured with respondent No.3. Documents brought on record by respondent No.3 i.e insurance policy Ex R1, copy of RC of offending vehicle Tanker GJ-12-AT-5251 Ex R2, receipt Ex R3, fitness verification report Ex R4, report Ex R5, copy of permit Ex R6, document Ex R7, recovery memo regarding taking into possession driving licence of respondent No.2 Ex R8 and verification report EX R9 also reveal that at the time of accident the vehicle in question was owned by respondent No.1 and it was being driven by respondent No.2 who had relevant transport documents at the time of accident. CW1 also uncontrovertedly stated that he and claimant No.2 are parents while claimant No.3 is widow and claimants No.4 and 5 are children of deceased. However, this deposition of CW1 also shows that he is aged 45 years and independently is owning and cultivating 3 acres land in Distt. Patna, Bihar. He, therefore, was not dependent upon the deceased. Remaining claimants are mother, wife and children of deceased. They are his legal heirs. They, therefore, are entitled to be compensated by respondents No.1 and 3 for causing the death of Rahul Kumar. 14.To prove the quantum of income of deceased Rahul Kumar, the claimants have examined CW4 Harish Kumar Sethi who proved copy of appointment letter of deceased as Ex C1 and copy of his PAN card as Ex C2. This appointment letter shows the details of salary of deceased. As per it his basic salary was Rs. 8750/-. In addition to it he was to receive Rs. 1000/- per month as Project Completion Bonus which though was payable after completion of assigned project. In this case the deceased 10 expired even before completion of the project. He, therefore, has to be deemed entitled for such bonus at the rate of Rs. 1000/- per month. His total salary, therefore, comes to Rs.9750/- which is rounded off to Rs.10,000/- per month when remaining portion of his salary as per document Ex C1 consists of different allowances. As per petition and as per postmortem report Ex C5 the deceased was between 26-30 years. As per judgment National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and Ors, SLP (Civil) No.25590 of 2014 decided on 31.10.2017 of Hon'ble Apex Court 40% of the income is to be added as future prospects of deceased which comes to Rs.4000/-. His monthly income, therefore, has to be taken as Rs.14,000/-. By virtue of abovesaid judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court, when the dependents/ claimants are four in number, 1/4th of this monthly income has to be deducted as personal expenses of the deceased. The dependency of claimants, therefore, comes to Rs. 10,500/- per month. It annually comes to Rs.1,26,000/- per month. By virtue of this Judgment , when deceased was just 26-30 years old, multiplier of 17 is to be applied. The dependency of claimants No.2 to 5, therefore, comes out to Rs. 21,42,000/-(Rs.1,26,000 X 17). Besides it, as per ratio of above cited case law, claimant No.3 also is entitled to Rs. 15,000/- as funeral expenses of deceased, Rs. 15,000/- as loss of estate and Rs. 40,000/- as loss of consortium. 15.As a result of above detailed discussion, both these issues accordingly are decided in favour of claimants No.2 to 5 and against respondents No.1 and 3 while holding that these respondents jointly and severally are liable to pay Rs. 22,12,000/- to these claimants. 11 ISSUES NO. 3 TO 5. 16.In view of my findings on issues No.1 and 2, this petition for compensation on account of causing of death of Rahul Kumar in Motor Vehicular Accident is very much maintainable under M.V. Act,1988. In view of findings in these issues the current claim petition also is not bad for non-joinder of necessary parties and the claimants cannot be estopped from filing such petition. Therefore, these issues No. 3 to 5 are decided against respondents and in favour of claimants. ISSUE NO.6: 17. Onus to prove this issue was on the respondent No.3 which itself tendered the transport documents relating to respondents No.1 and 2 on file as Ex R1 to Ex R9. Therefore, this issue is decided against the respondent No.3 and in favour of claimant party. ISSUE NO.7 (RELIEF) 18.In the sequel to my findings under aforesaid issues, this claim petition succeeds and the same is hereby allowed with costs as follows. The total compensation amount of Rs.22,12,000/- (Rs. Twenty two lakhs and twelve thousands only) is held liable to be paid by the respondents no.1 and 3, jointly and severally, to claimants No.2 to 5. Out of this amount, the claimant No.3 (wife) will receive Rs. 10,12,000/- whereas claimants No.2,4 and 5 will receive Rs. 4 lakhs each. The share of minor claimants No. 4 and 5 shall be kept in fixed deposit with a nationalized bank by claimant No.3 till they attain majority. On attaining of such majority, and subject to furnishing of proof of identity and age, concerned bank will release the amount to claimants No.4 and 5 on 12 verification of such proof at its own level. These claimants No.2 to 5 also will be entitled to pendente lite and future interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum on the awarded amount, from the date of filing of this petition till the date of actual realization of the amount. Respondent No.3 being insurance company and being bound to indemnify respondent No.1 to compensate any 3rd party claim, shall have the prior liability to clear this amount. 19.Counsel fee is assessed at Rs.1100/-.

The passersby and other persons sleeping or residing in the surrounding area were badly affected by inhaling of this gas. 5 persons 6 including Rahul Kumar and Satpal Moker died. Another about 150 persons were also badly affected who were taken to different hospitals for treatment. The leakage of gas from abovesaid said Tanker could be controlled by the Fire-brigade people after putting in strenuous efforts of over 7-8 hours. Rahul Kumar had died on 13.6.2015 due to inhaling of gas. His postmortem was conducted at Civil Hospital, Ludhiana on 14.6.2015. CW3 further stated that his statement was recorded by the police as well but the FIR was lodged on the statement of Vijay Kumar. Cross-examination of this CW3 though reveals that he had no document to prove that he was in Doraha on the fateful day and time. He came on a Motorcycle from his Village to Doraha but he does not remember the registration number of that vehicle. He though conceded that at the time of occurrence he was sitting at the house of his in-laws situate about 500 meters from the place of occurrence. He too had suffered Ammonia Gas effects but he did not seek any medical treatment. He also had not seen the offending driver. Remaining suggestions were denied by him. CW4 examined by claimants is Harish Kumar Sethi, Office Coordinator, from Louis Berger Consulting Pvt. Ltd. He appeared with relevant record and deposed in his examination-in-chief that Rahul Kumar (deceased) was appointed with said company w.e.f 1.11.2012 as a Lab Assistant and his gross salary was Rs. 17,500/- per month. Copy of his appointment letter is Ex C1 and copy of his PAN card is Ex C2. Cross-examination of this witness is formal, bookish and explanatory in nature where he explained that the Employer Company maintains the Wages Register and other record. Remaining suggestions were denied by him. 7 13.It is argued by Ld. Counsel for claimants that the eyewitness account regarding the referred occurrence has come on file through the deposition of CW3. Copy of report under section 173(2) Cr.P.C pertaining to this occurrence is Ex C4 and copy of FIR attached with the same shows that it though was lodged on the statement of Vijay Kumar but this CW3 also was a witness to the occurrence. He also had suffered effects of inhaling of Ammonia Gas from the involved Tanker. This CW3 also had suffered statement before the police. Mere fact that FIR was not lodged on his statement cannot have any bearing on the matter. More over, he is not related to claimants or deceased in any manner. In Judgment Somari Devi and others Vs. Ragwar Singh and others, 2011 ACJ 1475 the Hon'ble Delhi High Court held that statement of eyewitness and documents clearly proved the taking place of occurrence. The name of eyewitness (like CW3) being not in FIR does not mean that his deposition could not be taken into account. Otherwise also the lodging of mere FIR proves the taking place of occurrence. Another Judgment Girdhari lal Vs Radhey Sham,1993(2) PLR 109 holds that the FIR is a strong circumstance that accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of the driver. On the other hand Ld. Counsel for Insurance Company respondent No.3 argued that this respondent is not liable to indemnify other respondents as the Tanker owner was required to draw insurance policy under the Public Liability Insurance Act,1991 when the offending Tanker was carrying hazardous substance i.e Ammonia Gas. Fact remains that said policy could be drawn by the owner/respondent No.1. No public in general would be in the know that the Tanker was 8 carrying some hazardous substance. Otherwise also the Tanker had hit the roof of over bridge. It could not take place had its driver been cautious and could assess the height of roof of the bridge before crossing the same. He misjudged it resulting in hitting of the top portion of Tanker with the roof of over bridge. The Tanker admittedly was carrying Ammonia Gas, which, as is a fact of common knowledge, is a poisonous substance. In Judgments New India Assurance Co. Ltd., Appellant vs. Biman Prasad Barkakati and others,2009 ACJ 974 and United India Insurance Co. Ltd., vs. Janki Devi and others, 2013 ACJ 1509 it is held that if the offending vehicle was carrying an inflammable and hazardous substance at the time of accident and the accident had taken place, the insurance company is liable to pay the compensation. In these circumstances, the non-drawing of insurance policy by the owner of involved Tanker i.e respondent No.1 under the Public Liability Insurance Act,1991 has no consequence so far as the claim of claimants is concerned. 13.The uncontrovrted depositions of CW1 Ajay Kumar, of CW3 eyewitness Aditya Kumar, contents of abovesaid FIR, of report under section 173(2) Cr.P.C Ex C4 and postmortem report Ex C5 all show that Rahul Kumar had died by 3.15 AM on 13.6.2015. This postmortem report Ex C5 also shows that the death had taken place due to inhaling of poisonous substance/gas by him. This piece of evidence also has remaining unchallenged by the appearing respondent. The death of Rahul Kumar, therefore, is attributable to the rash and negligent driving of abovesaid Tanker belonging to respondent No.1, as it was carrying 9 poisonous Ammonia Gas and had hit the over bridge causing its leakage, which admittedly was insured with respondent No.3. Documents brought on record by respondent No.3 i.e insurance policy Ex R1, copy of RC of offending vehicle Tanker GJ-12-AT-5251 Ex R2, receipt Ex R3, fitness verification report Ex R4, report Ex R5, copy of permit Ex R6, document Ex R7, recovery memo regarding taking into possession driving licence of respondent No.2 Ex R8 and verification report EX R9 also reveal that at the time of accident the vehicle in question was owned by respondent No.1 and it was being driven by respondent No.2 who had relevant transport documents at the time of accident. CW1 also uncontrovertedly stated that he and claimant No.2 are parents while claimant No.3 is widow and claimants No.4 and 5 are children of deceased. However, this deposition of CW1 also shows that he is aged 45 years and independently is owning and cultivating 3 acres land in Distt. Patna, Bihar. He, therefore, was not dependent upon the deceased. Remaining claimants are mother, wife and children of deceased. They are his legal heirs. They, therefore, are entitled to be compensated by respondents No.1 and 3 for causing the death of Rahul Kumar. 14.To prove the quantum of income of deceased Rahul Kumar, the claimants have examined CW4 Harish Kumar Sethi who proved copy of appointment letter of deceased as Ex C1 and copy of his PAN card as Ex C2. This appointment letter shows the details of salary of deceased. As per it his basic salary was Rs. 8750/-. In addition to it he was to receive Rs. 1000/- per month as Project Completion Bonus which though was payable after completion of assigned project. In this case the deceased 10 expired even before completion of the project. He, therefore, has to be deemed entitled for such bonus at the rate of Rs. 1000/- per month. His total salary, therefore, comes to Rs.9750/- which is rounded off to Rs.10,000/- per month when remaining portion of his salary as per document Ex C1 consists of different allowances. As per petition and as per postmortem report Ex C5 the deceased was between 26-30 years. As per judgment National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and Ors, SLP (Civil) No.25590 of 2014 decided on 31.10.2017 of Hon'ble Apex Court 40% of the income is to be added as future prospects of deceased which comes to Rs.4000/-. His monthly income, therefore, has to be taken as Rs.14,000/-. By virtue of abovesaid judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court, when the dependents/ claimants are four in number, 1/4th of this monthly income has to be deducted as personal expenses of the deceased. The dependency of claimants, therefore, comes to Rs. 10,500/- per month. It annually comes to Rs.1,26,000/- per month. By virtue of this Judgment , when deceased was just 26-30 years old, multiplier of 17 is to be applied. The dependency of claimants No.2 to 5, therefore, comes out to Rs. 21,42,000/-(Rs.1,26,000 X 17). Besides it, as per ratio of above cited case law, claimant No.3 also is entitled to Rs. 15,000/- as funeral expenses of deceased, Rs. 15,000/- as loss of estate and Rs. 40,000/- as loss of consortium. 15.As a result of above detailed discussion, both these issues accordingly are decided in favour of claimants No.2 to 5 and against respondents No.1 and 3 while holding that these respondents jointly and severally are liable to pay Rs. 22,12,000/- to these claimants. 11 ISSUES NO. 3 TO 5. 16.In view of my findings on issues No.1 and 2, this petition for compensation on account of causing of death of Rahul Kumar in Motor Vehicular Accident is very much maintainable under M.V. Act,1988. In view of findings in these issues the current claim petition also is not bad for non-joinder of necessary parties and the claimants cannot be estopped from filing such petition. Therefore, these issues No. 3 to 5 are decided against respondents and in favour of claimants. ISSUE NO.6: 17. Onus to prove this issue was on the respondent No.3 which itself tendered the transport documents relating to respondents No.1 and 2 on file as Ex R1 to Ex R9. Therefore, this issue is decided against the respondent No.3 and in favour of claimant party. ISSUE NO.7 (RELIEF) 18.In the sequel to my findings under aforesaid issues, this claim petition succeeds and the same is hereby allowed with costs as follows. The total compensation amount of Rs.22,12,000/- (Rs. Twenty two lakhs and twelve thousands only) is held liable to be paid by the respondents no.1 and 3, jointly and severally, to claimants No.2 to 5. Out of this amount, the claimant No.3 (wife) will receive Rs. 10,12,000/- whereas claimants No.2,4 and 5 will receive Rs. 4 lakhs each. The share of minor claimants No. 4 and 5 shall be kept in fixed deposit with a nationalized bank by claimant No.3 till they attain majority. On attaining of such majority, and subject to furnishing of proof of identity and age, concerned bank will release the amount to claimants No.4 and 5 on 12 verification of such proof at its own level. These claimants No.2 to 5 also will be entitled to pendente lite and future interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum on the awarded amount, from the date of filing of this petition till the date of actual realization of the amount. Respondent No.3 being insurance company and being bound to indemnify respondent No.1 to compensate any 3rd party claim, shall have the prior liability to clear this amount. 19.Counsel fee is assessed at Rs.1100/-. Memo of costs be prepared. File be consigned to the Record Room. Pronounced in open Court. (Rajeev K.Beri), Dated:14.11.2017 Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ludhiana (UID No. PB-0149).

Present:Sh.J.K.Kapila Adv, Counsel for the claimant Sh.Jarnail Singh Adv, Counsel for respondents No.1 & 2 Sh.Rajiv Abhi Adv.,Counsel for the respondent No.4. Sh.D.R.Rampal Adv.,Counsel for the respondent No.5. A W A R D : The claimant No.1 being widow of Dr.Jagdeep Singh, claimant No.2 being minor son and claimant No.3 being mother of deceased Dr.Jagdeep Singh have brought the present claim petition for compensation under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act. 2.The accident took place on 8.5.2014 at about 4 P.M.within the jurisdiction of Police Station Sadar, Dhuri. It is claimed that age of the deceased at the time of death was 43 years. He was serving as a Doctor and was having monthly income of Rs.44,000/- per month. 3.Briefly, the case of the claimants is that on 8.5.2014, deceased Dr.Jagdeep Singh was going to village Bhundh, Tehsil and District Patiala in Alto car bearing No.PB-10-CR-0678 to meet his maternal grandmother Page: 3 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.53 of 23.3.2015 and other relatives. He was accompanied by his father late S.Bhagwan Singh; his wife Navneet Kaur, his minor son Milaap Singh and his maternal uncle, namely S. Bhupinder Singh. Bhupinder Singh had come to see his sister Amarjit Kaur and the other members of the family of his sister to Ludhiana from Village Bhundh, as such, he had also joined S.Bhagwan Singh and other members for going back to his village Bhundh. Dr.Jagdeep Singh was on the wheels of the car and S.Bhagwan Singh was sitting besides him and all other occupants including the claimant were sitting on the backside seat of the car. When at about 4 P.M. they had reached just ahead of Rattan Resorts, Dhuri, then one Tempo No.PB13-F-3428 which was being driven by the respondent No.1 rashly and negligently and in a zigzag manner, came from the opposite direction and while coming on its wrong side of the road, struck against the car. As Dr.Jagdeep Singh was driving his car at a fast speed, he could not control his car and there was a head on collusion between the two vehicles. The respondent No.1 after striking the aforesaid tempo against the Alto car, had dragged the car for a distance on account of which the Alto car was badly damaged and all the occupants, including Dr.Jagdeep Singh received multiple accidental injuries on their persons. Dr.Jagdeep Singh succumbed to the injuries at the spot while Bhagwan Singh scummbed to the injuries on the way to the hospital. 4.It has been further averred that Dr.Jagdeep Singh died in a motor vehicle accident and the claimants being the legal heirs of deceased, have sought the compensation of Rs.One Crore alongwith interest at the rate of Page: 4 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.53 of 23.3.2015 18% per annum from the date of accident till realisation, on account of death of Dr.Jagdeep Singh in the motor vehicle accident 5.The claim petition has been contested by the set of respondents by filing their separate written statements. In the written statement filed by the respondents no.1 and 2, they have taken the preliminary objections that the claim petition is not maintainable in the present form, no accident took place on 8.5.2014 at about 4 P.M.near Rattan Resorts, Dhuri of Tempo No.PB-13-F-3428 and Alto car No.PB-10-CR-0678 on account of the rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1. No injury has been sustained by Dr.Jagdeep Singh in the alleged accident. The respondent No.1 was driver by profession. He is holder of valid driving licence at the time of alleged accident. He is expert in his profession. The respondent No.2 is the owner of the said tempo. Before appointing the respondent No.1 as driver of tempo, his driving licence was duly verified by the respondent No.2 and it was in order. The respondent No.1 has been falsely implicated in case FIR No.90 of 8.5.2014 by the Police of P.S. Sadar, Dhuri at the instance of the complainant, who is a very influential person. Tempo No.PB-13-F-3428 was not insured with the Insurance Company at the time of alleged accident. The answering respondents are not liable to pay any compensation and interest to the claimant. On merits, the mode and manner of the accident has been denied. The registration of FIR against the respondent No.1 has been admitted, however, it has been stated to be based on false and concocted facts. It has been stated that no injury has been sustained by the deceased Dr.Jagdeep Singh in the alleged Page: 5 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.53 of 23.3.2015 accident. It has been denied that claimant spent a sum of Rs.1 lac on the transportation and last rites of Dr.Jagdeep Singh. The amount claimed in the claim petition is stated to be highly exaggerated and excessive. The answering respondents are not legally liable and bound to pay any compensation to the claimant as no accident took place with the vehicle of the answering respondents. It is denied that on account of said accident, the claimant No.1 has lost her life companion, claimant No.2 has lost her father, and claimant No.3 has lost her loving son. It is denied that the deceased was serving as expert Doctor with the department of Plastic Surgery, Ismani Medical College, Hyderabad. It is denied that his salary was Rs.44000/- per month but was to be increased to Rs.1,00,000/- per month in the coming two years as per his outstanding performance. It has been denied that he had been participating in different medical conferences and had appreciation letter from all institutions, whenever he participated. It is denied that after retirement, he had to start independent practice and his income would have been increased manifolds as during service, he would have gained vast experience in his subject. It is denied that claimants are the legal representatives of deceased and they were totally dependent upon the income of the deceased. The averments of the preliminary objections have been reiterated. While denying all other averments made in the petition, it has ultimately been prayed that the petition may be dismissed. 6.The respondent No.3 insurance company was arrayed without name and particulars were not supplied later on. Page: 6 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.53 of 23.3.2015 7.The respondent No.4 has taken the preliminary objections that the petition is not maintainable since the accident has occurred due to rash and negligent driving of offending tempo No.PB-13-F-3482 and not on account of rash and negligent driving of Dr.Jagdeep Singh. Even the FIR No.90 dated 8.4.2014 P.S. Sadar, Dhuri has been lodged against the respondent No.1 i.e. driver of the tempo No.PB-13-F-3482. The claim petition is bad for misjoinder of parties since respondent No.4 is neither a necessary nor proper party to the claim petition. The respondent No.4 has been falsely implicated in this petition. The claim petition is not maintainable since car No.PB-10-CR-0678 is insured with the respondent No.5 for unlimited third party liability as per the provisions of Motor Vehicle Act as the car was comprehensively insured with the respondent No.5 and it is the respondent No.5 who is to pay the compensation, if any, to the claimant. The claim petition is not maintainable since the respondent No.4 has not committed any breach of terms and conditions of the insurance policy. The car was comprehensively insured with the respondent No.5 and was badly damaged in the accident amounting to total loss. A claim was lodged for own damage of the car in question which was duly registered, processed and paid by the respondent No.5 qua the damage caused to the car. Dr.Jagdeep Singh now deceased was holding a valid and effective driving licence on the date of alleged accident. On merits, it is denied for want of knowledge that monthly income of the deceased was Rs.44,000/-. It is admitted that employer of deceased was Osmania Medical College, Hyderabad. It is admitted that Page: 7 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.53 of 23.3.2015 accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of offending tempo No.PB-13F-3482 and not on account of rash and negligent driving of deceased Dr.Jagdeep Singh. Even FIR No.90 dated 8.4.2014, P.S.Sadar, Dhuri, District Sangrur has been lodged against the respondent No.1 i.e. driver of tempo No.PB-13-F-3482. It is denied that the claimants have spent a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- on transportation and last rites of Dr.Jagdeep Singh. It is also admitted that car No.PB-10-CR-0678 is insured with the respondent No.5 under comprehensive insurance policy for unlimited third party liability. If any compensation is to be awarded, the same has to be paid by the respondent No.5. Deceased Dr.Jagdeep Singh was holding a valid and effective driving licence and respondent No.4 has not committed any breach of the terms and conditions of the policy. Own damage claim i.e. damage caused to the car No.PB-10-CR-0678 had already been paid by the respondent No.5. The respondent No.5 has been duly intimated about the death of Dr.Jagdeep Singh, S. Bhagwan Singh and injuries to the other occupants of the car, namely Navneet Kaur and Milap Singh at the time of lodging the claim in respect to the damage caused to the car No.PB-10-CR-0678. It is admitted that Dr.Jagdeep Singh was serving as Doctor with the Department of Plastic Surgery, Osmania Medial College, Hyderabad but the other averments have been denied. It is denied that the claimants have suffered mental pain and agony on account of accidental death of Dr.Jagdeep Singh. It is denied that his salary was Rs.44,000/- per month or that it was to be increased to Rs.1,00,000/- per month in the coming two years as per his outstanding Page: 8 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.53 of 23.3.2015 performance. It is denied that he had been participating in different medical conferences and had appreciation letter from all institutions, wherever he participated or that after retirement he was to started his independent practice. It is denied that his income would have increased manifold as during service, he would have gained vast experience in his subject. It is denied that Dr.Jagdeep Singh was only ray of hope of their future. It is denied that they were totally dependent upon the income of the deceased. It is denied that abrupt death of Dr.Jagdeep Singh has caused huge mental and economic loss to the claimants. It is submitted that the accident has occurred due to rash and negligent driving of offending tempo No.PB-13F-3482 and not on account of rash and negligent driving of deceased Dr.Jagdeep Singh. It is denied that Dr.Jagdeep Singh was driving his car at a fast speed, he could not control his car. It is denied that there was a head on collusion between two vehicles. It is however submitted that Dr.Jagdeep Singh and Bhgwan Singh had succumbed to the injuries whereas Navneet Kaur and Milap Singh have received injuries. While denying all other averments, it has ultimately been prayed that the claim petition may be dismissed. 8.The respondent No.5 has averred in the written statement by taking preliminary objections that the claim petition is not drafted in accordance with rules of the Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court and Motor Vehicle Act and the same is not verified in accordance with the provisions of Order 6 Rule 15 of the CPC and the same is not maintainable in the present form. The claim petition is bad for non joinder and misjoinder of Page: 9 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.53 of 23.3.2015 necessary parties. The claimants have not suffered the loss of any kind. Even as per allegations mentioned in the claim petition, the alleged accident took place due to negligence of Dr.Jagdeep Singh deceased and claimants cannot take advantage of own wrongs of Dr.Jagdee Singh deceased and cannot claim compensation. The respondent No.1 and deceased Dr.Jagdeep Singh were not possessing valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident and were also not driving Tempo No.PB-13-F-3428 and Car No.PB-10-CR-0678 in the course of his employment with the owner and insured of above said vehicles and have violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and also breached the provisions of the M.V .Act. The insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation. The vehicle No.PB-10-CR-0678 was not having valid registration certificate and fitness certificate at the time of alleged accident and was being driven against the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and in violation of Motor Vehicle Act. The owner and insured of vehicles were fully aware that respondent No.1 and Dr.Jagdeep Singh did not possess valid and effective driving licencces and they did not take due precaution and reasonable care and as such the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. No liability can be fastened on the answering respondent. The answering respondent takes all defences under Section 147, 149, 157, 170 of the Motor Vehicle Act and reserves its right to file an amended written statement and additional written statement on disclosure of new facts. The vehicle is stated to be insured with the answering respondent, should comply with Page: 10 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.53 of 23.3.2015 the provisions of Section 64 VB of the Insurance Act, 1938. The answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation as demanded in the petition. If it is held by this Tribunal that case of claimants is fully established and answering respondent is liable to pay compensation, then sufficient time may kindly be granted to deposit the award amount without any interest. On merits, it is averred that no accident took place as alleged. The claimants be put to strict proof of the allegations made in the claim petition. The mode and manner of the accident has been denied. It has been averred that even as per the allegations mentioned in the claim petition, deceased Dr.Jagdeep Singh was negligent at the time of alleged accident and claimants cannot take the advantage of own wrong of deceased Dr.Jagdeep Singh. The claimants cannot demand the compensation on account of death of deceased Dr.Jagdeep Singh in this claim petition. While denying all other averments of the claim petition, it has been prayed that the same may be dismissed. 9.On the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed and recorded: “1. Whether deceased Jagdeep Singh died in motor vehicle accident caused on 8.05.2014 due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 of the vehicle i.e. tempo No.PB-13F-3428? OPP. 2. Whether the claimants are entitled to compensation? If so to what extent? OPP. 3. Whether the claim petition is not maintainable? OPR. Page: 11 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.53 of 23.3.2015 4.Whether the claim petition is bad for non joinder and misjoinder of necessary parties? OPR. 5. Relief.” 10.The claimants in order to prove their case, examined one of the claimant, namely Navneet Kaur as PW1 who by way of her Affidavit Ex.PA, has deposed in lines with the pleaded case of the claimants and reiterated the facts pleaded by them which for the sake of brevity and to avoid repetition, may be omitted to be mentioned here again. 11.The learned Counsel for the claimants tendered into evidence the joining report of Dr.Jagdeep Singh Ex.P13, copy of Employment Certificate and Attendance Certificate Ex.P14, copy of Registration Certificate with Punjab Medical Council Ex.P15 and Certificate of the University Ex.P16 and closed the evidence. 12.The learned Counsel for the respondent No.5 tendered into evidence document Ex.R1. Counsel for the respondent No.4 tendered into evidence copy of insurance Ex.R2, copy of Driving Licence Ex.R3 and copy of Registration Certificate Ex.R4. The respondents No.1 and 2 availed several opportunities but did not adduce any evidence. Therefore, their evidence was closed by orders. 13.I have heard the learned Counsel for the parties and have gone through the record with their able assistance. My issue-wise findings are as under: Issues No.1 and 2: 14.Both these issues are interconnected and can be discussed and Page: 12 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.53 of 23.3.2015 disposed of together conveniently. 15.The learned Counsel for the claimants has contended that his Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal has already decided MACT No.54 of 23.3.2015 titled as “Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh” and also decided another claim petition No.51 of 23.3.2015 titled as “Amarjit Kaur vs. Kewal Singh”. In the said Awards, composite negligence was held. When once the Tribunal has decided the claim petition arising out of the same accident, no further facts are to be proved by the claimant. The claimant has also proved the education, training and experience of the deceased as a Specialist Doctor and his income proof. Therefore, the claimants are entitled to the compensation claimed for. 16.The learned Counsel for the insurance company respondent No.5 has contended that where the accident has happened between two vehicles, the passengers of the vehicle can claim the composite negligence of drivers of both the vehicles but where one of the driver of the said accident himself claims compensation for injuries or if he dies, the claim petition is lodged by his legal heirs, compensation is to be assessed taking contributory negligence qua the drivers and not the composite negligence. 17.Navneet Kaur is one of the claimants. She is widow of Dr.Jagdeep Singh. She has deposed as one of the claimants supporting the claim petition. She has narrated the version regarding happening of the accident as has been pleaded in the petition. The husband of the deponent was driving the car, her version is corroborated by the copy of FIR Ex.P1 regarding the mode and manner of the accident. The death of Dr.Jagdeep Page: 13 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.53 of 23.3.2015 Singh has not been denied. It is further established from the Post Moretm Examination Report Ex.P2. The information was regarding the said road side accident and the cause of death was the injuries suffered by him in the accident. However, it has appeared in the cross-examination of Navneet Kaur PW1 that it was a highway road as the car was being driven at high speed near about 100 Kms.per hour. The other vehicle had come from the opposite direction at the speed of 100 Kms.per hour in a zigzag manner. The width of the road at the place of accident is wide enough and two heavy vehicles can cross each other simultaneously. The front of both the vehicles had struck against each other. The vehicle was driven by her husband Dr.Jagdeep Singh who was driving the car at high speed. He was also negligent to some extent. Obviously, the claim petition filed by Navneet Kaur earlier regarding the injuries suffered by her in the accident and by Amarjit Kaur regarding the injuries suffered by the accident, were filed by them as occupants of the car driven by Dr.Jagdeep Singh which met with accident and resulted into injuries. This Tribunal thus correctly held the composite negligence for the purpose of liability to pay the compensation to the occupants of one of the vehicles. It is brought to the notice of the Tribunal by the Counsel for claimants that United India Insurance Company Limited who was respondent in the claim petition of Navneet Kaur and Amarjit Kaur, filed FAO No.4761 of 2016 and FAO No.4566 of 2016 and both the petitions were dismissed by the Hon'ble High Court vide order dated 5.9.2016. But so far as the assessment of liability concerning the compensation for the death of husband of the Page: 14 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.53 of 23.3.2015 claimant No.1 Dr.Jagdeep Singh, who was driving the vehicle and in view of the depositions appearing in the cross-examination of PW1 Navneet Kaur, contributory negligence is to be taken. With my respectful submission and agreement to the pronouncements relied upon by he Counsel for the claimant and respondent No.4 reported as “Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co.Ltd. V .Jasmer Sigh and another, 2016 ACJ 47”, the Court is of the opinion that there is no reasonable basis with the claimants and respondent No.4 to apply the said pronouncement to the facts and circumstances of the present case more particularly when it relates to a case before the Hon'ble High Court arising out of the claim petition filed under Section 163-A of the Motor Vehicle Act and the present claim petition is under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act. 18.It would not be out of place to mention here the pronouncements relied upon by the learned Counsel for the respondent No.5. In the pronouncement “T.O.Anthony Versus Karvarnan and others, 2008(2) RCR (Civil) 120” of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, it has been held as under: “5...............In an accident involving two or more vehicles, where a third party (other than the drivers and/or owners of the vehicles involved) claims damages for loss or injuries, it is said that compensation is payable in respect of the composite negligence of the drivers of those vehicles. But in respect of such an accident, if the Page: 15 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.53 of 23.3.2015 claim is by one of the drivers himself for personal injuries, or by the legal heirs of one of the drivers for loss on account of his death, or by the owner of one of the vehicles in respect of damages to his vehicle, then the issue that arises is not about the composite negligence of all the drivers, but about the contributory negligence of the driver concerned.” 19.In the pronouncement “Khenyei Versus New India Assurance Co.Ltd.& Ors, 2015(2) RCR (Civil) 1019” of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, it has been held as under: “14. There is a difference between contributory and composite negligence. In the case of contributory negligence, a person who has himself contributed to the extent cannot claim compensation for the injuries sustained by him in the accident to the extent of his own negligence; whereas in the case of composite negligence, a person who has suffered has not contributed to the accident but the outcome of combination of negligence of two or more other persons.” 20.In the pronouncement reported as “Kamlesh Rani and Page: 16 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.53 of 23.3.2015 others Versus Pardeep Kalkeets and others, 2014(3) Law Herald 2412” of the Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court, it has been held as under: “3. The issue of whether there could be an abatement on compensation or not would truly depend on whether there had been a contributory negligence on the part of the deceased to subject the assessment to an abatement of claim. There is a distinction between a composite negligence and a contributory negligence, which is brought about in the judgment of this Court Ms. Sandhya Sikka V . Munna Lal, 2012(4) Law Herald (SC) (P&H) 3061 : 2012(4) PLR 788, referring to judgments of the Supreme Court, and a claimant in composite negligence is at liberty to prosecute the claim against anyone of the tort feasors without suffering any abatement of claim. In a case of contributory negligence, a person who makes a claim or whose representative makes a claim will suffer a loss to the extent of negligence attributed to such person. If in this case three persons had been travellers in the car and if the deceased had been a driver then a case of contributory negligence could have been used to Page: 17 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.53 of 23.3.2015 partially abate the claim to he extent of 50% for the negligence found.” 21.The learned Counsel has also referred to pronouncements reported as “Sarita and others Versus Azad and another, 2014(3) PLR 636” of the Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court; and “Kamlesh & Ors. Versus Attar Singh & Ors., 2016(1) RCR (Civil) 24” of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, in this regard. 22.No defect or discrepancy in the driving licence and insurance policy, Registration Certificate has been claimed by the respondent No.5 nor proved. The copy of certificate of insurance is Ex.R1 and Ex.R2 on record. The insurance policy was to expire on the midnight of 23.2.2015. The accident took place on 8.5.2014 i.e. within the validity period of insurance policy. Copy of driving licence of Dr.Jagdeep Singh is Ex.R3 on record. Copy of Certificate of Registration is Ex.R4. As per the copy of Provisional Certificate Ex.p3, Dr.Jagdeep Singh passed M.Ch. Plastic Surgery Super Speciality Examination in July 2013. Copy of degree of the Banglore University is Ex.P4 and copy of degree of Master of Surgery is Ex.P5. The honorarium as per the posting order was Rs.30,000/- per month copy of which is Ex.P6. Copy of driving licence of Dr.Jagdeep Singh is Ex.P7, copy of income tax return is Ex.P8, copy of Passport is Ex.P9, copy of Aadhar Card in the name of Amarjit Kaur is Ex.P10 and copy of PAN Card of Amarjit Kaur is Ex.P11. Copy of Election Commission Identity Card of Navneet Kaur Ex.P12 was also tendered into evidence. The Certificate issued by MNJ Institute of Oncology & Page: 18 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.53 of 23.3.2015 Regional Cancer Centre, Hyderabad regarding discharge of duty sincerely by Dr.Jagdeep Singh is Ex.P13. Copy of attendance register is Ex.P14, copy of Certificate issud by the Punjab Medical Council is Ex.P15 and copy of qualifying examination of Master of General Surgery is Ex.P16. 23.As per the Affidavit Ex.PA, deceased Dr.Jagdeep Singh was getting Rs.44,000/- per month but it was to be increased to Rs.1,00,000/- (one lac) in the coming two years but as per the certificate issued by the Institution, the honorarium fixed for the Resident Specialist Degree (P.G.) was Rs.30,000/- per month. The age of the deceased has been claimed to be 43 years as per the claim petition. The multiplier of 14 is applicable in this case. The deceased was in the age group of 40 to 50 years. Therefore, there must be an addition of 30% in the income of the deceased. 24.The vehicle bearing Registration No.PB-10-CR-0678 was insured with the respondent No.5 and the accident having taken place within the period of insurance, the respondent No.5 is liable to reimburse the respondent No.4 owner of the car No.PB-10-CR-0678 if the amount of compensation is recovered from the respondent No.4. 25.The monthly income of deceased Dr.Jagdeep Singh as per Ex.P6 is 30,000/- per month. The addition of 30% is to be given. The monthly₹ income thus comes to 39,000/-. The amount of 1/3rd is to be deducted ₹ towards the personal living and expenses of the deceased. The monthly income for the purpose of assessing compensation comes to 26,000/- ₹ i.e. 3,12,000/- per annum. By applying the multiplier of 14 in this case,₹ the amount of compensation thus comes to 43,68,000/-. The respondent ₹ Page: 19 Navneet Kaur vs. Kewal Singh MACT No.53 of 23.3.2015 No.1 is the driver of offending tempo bearing Registration No.PB-13-F- 3428. Jang Singh respondent No.2 is owner of the said tempo. Dr.Jagjit Singh respondent No.4 is owner of the offending car bearing Registration No.PB-10-CR-0678 and United India Insurance Company Ltd.is respondent No.5. As discussed earlier, the car of respondent No.4 was insured with the respondent No.5. As discussed earlier, where the accident involves two or more vehicles and the third party other than the drivers and/or owners of the vehicles is involved, the claim of damages for loss or injuries, is composite i.e. compensation is payable in respect of the composite negligence of drivers of those vehicles and the injured in such a case has option to proceed against all or any of the joint tort feasors but in respect of such an accident, if the claim is by one of the drivers himself for personal injury or by the legal heirs of one of the drivers for loss on account of his death or by the owner of one of the vehicles in respect of damages to his vehicle, it would be contributory negligence of the drivers concerned. Therefore, the contributory negligence is assessed to be 50%. Therefore, 50% of the amount of compensation to be assessed here-in-after shall be payable by Kewal Singh and Jang Singh respondents No.1 and 2; and 50% of the amount of compensation to be assessed here-in-after shall be paid by Dr.Jagjit Singh respondent No.4 and United India Insurance Company Ltd.respondent No.5. The respondent No.5 being Insurance Company has to reimburse the amount, if recovered from the respondent No.4 Dr.Jagjit Singh.

The compensation amount is thus assessed to be ₹ 43,68,000/- (forty three lacs, sixty eight thousand). Out of the said amount, the claimant No.3 is entitled to the amount of 25% i.e. ₹ 10,92,000/- (ten lacs ninety two thousand) being aged mother of deceased Dr.Jagdeep Singh.

However if need be, the claimant No.1 may withdraw the amount from the amount of interest earned by the fixed deposit for the welfare of the minor. Both these issues are thus decided against the respondents and in favour of the claimant. Issue No.3: 29.In view of the findings returned on the issues No.1 and 2, the Court is of the opinion that the claim petition filed by the claimants seeking compensation on account of death of Dr.Jagdeep Singh in a motor vehicle accident is duly maintainable in the present form but the respondents have failed to prove as to how the petition is not maintainable.

Vs. Jagtar Singh 7.I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the documents and evidence placed on record by them very carefully and minutely. My issue-wise findings are as under:- ISSUES NO. 1, 2 & 4 8.All these issues are being taken up together for the purpose of convenience being inter connected and in order to avoid repetition. The onus to prove issues No. 1 and 2 was placed upon the claimants whereas the onus to prove issue No. 4 was placed upon respondent No. 1.

He further testified that an amount of Rs.50,000/- was spent on the transportation and last rites of the deceased. He further testified that the accident was witnessed by Surjit Singh and regarding the accident, one FIR No. 9 dated 9.2.2015 was registered at PS Jodhan, District Ludhiana. He further testified that the deceased was 61 years old at the time of his death. He had retired as Assistant Lineman from Punjab State Electricity Board and was getting Rs.11,902/- per month as pension. He was having good health at the time of accident. The claimants have suffered loss of income, loss of estate, loss of love and affection etc. They were totally dependent upon the deceased and hence are entitled to compensation to the tune of Rs. 20 Lacs.

No injury has been sustained by Hakam Singh in the alleged accident and a false FIR No. 9 dated 9.2.2015 -8- MACP-226/2015 Tej Kaur & anr. Vs. Jagtar Singh under Sections 304A, 279, 427 IPC was registered at PS Jodhan, District Ludhiana (Rural) against him in which he was declared innocent on two occasions by the Investigating Officers of this case. He was holder of valid driving license at the time of alleged accident. He is not liable and not bound to pay any compensation to the claimants on account of death of Hakam Singh as the claimants are not the legal heirs of the deceased Hakam Singh. His vehicle was not involved in the alleged accident on the alleged time, date and place. He further testified that the amount claimed in the claim petition is highly exaggerated and excessive. He proved on record copy of his driving license as Ex.R1 along with the report of Superintendent of Police, Ludhiana as Ex.R2, letter No. 1080 dated 24.12.2015 as Ex.R3, letter No. 81 dated 7.5.2015 as Ex.R4, report of SP, Dakha dated 7.4.2015 as Ex.R5. 13.The respondent No. 1 alleged driver of Mohindra Maxi Truck bearing registration No. No. PB-10-BX-8359, who has preferred to contest the present claim petition being owner and driver of this vehicle has taken a specific stand that his vehicle No. PB-10-BX-8359 was not involved in the accident with motorcycle No. PB-19-D-8957 on 9.2.2014 at 12.40 AM and he was falsely implicated in the present case. So, he moved an application to the Commissioner of Police, Ludhiana (Rural) and the said application was investigated on two times and on both the times, he was found innocent by two Investigating Officers of the case bearing FIR No. 9 dated 9.2.2015 under Sections 304A, 279, 427 IPC, PS Jodhan, District Ludhiana. His contention is that he is having a valid driving license and so, is not liable and bound to pay any compensation to -9- MACP-226/2015 Tej Kaur & anr. Vs. Jagtar Singh the claimants on account of death of Hakam Singh. So, it is clear that the respondent No. 1 being the owner cum driver of Mohindra Maxi Truck No. PB-10-BX-8359 has tried to prove that his vehicle was not involved in the accident and so, he is not liable to pay the claim to the claimants. In this regard, he has cross examined CW1 and CW2 and also placed on record documents from Ex.R2 to Ex.R5. As per report dated 7.4.2015 given by SP, Dakha, the FIR against Jagtar Singh was ordered to be cancelled because he was found innocent and it was observed that some unknown vehicle has hit the vehicle of the deceased. Against this inquiry report, objections were filed by the applicant but ultimately, said application- objections were withdrawn. So, the respondent No. 1 is claiming that he is not bound to pay any compensation because as per inquiry report Ex.R5, he was found innocent. However, despite the fact that inquiry report regarding innocence of respondent No. 1 was given on 7.4.2015 but till date said cancellation report has not been accepted by any court of law and therefore, in my view, the respondent No. 1 cannot get any benefit in this petition to hold that the accident has not been caused by him in the present case. So, in my view, he has failed to provide the cause of accident as he was admittedly present on the spot. So, in my view, the evidence as lead on record by the respondent No. 1 is not sufficient to hold that the accident was not caused by respondent No. 1 on account of his rash and negligent act. So, from the evidence lead by the parties, I have found that it is established on record that respondent No. 1 Jagtar Singh drove his Mohindra Maxi Truck bearing registration No. PB- 10-BX-8359 in a rash and negligent manner and struck the same with the -10- MACP-226/2015 Tej Kaur & anr. Vs. Jagtar Singh motorcycle of the deceased bearing registration No. PB-19-D-8957 as a result of which Hakam Singh, who was driving the motor-cycle aforementioned received multiple and injuries on the vital parts of his body and ultimately died on account of said injuries. Moreover, FIR Ex.C1 bearing No. 9 dated 9.2.2015 was also registered against him in PS Jodhan, Ludhiana on account of his rash and negligent driving and thereby causing death of Hakam Singh on the road. The contention of the respondent No. 1 that no accident took place with his Mohindra Maxi Truck is not established on the record. So, it is held that the accident took place on account of rash and negligent driving of driver of vehicle bearing No. PB-10-BX-8359, who has been arrayed as respondent No. 1. In these circumstances of the case, I find that there is no dispute with regard to the accident and it has been duly proved been caused by respondent No. 1 on account of his rash and negligent driving and the claimants have deposed that respondent No. 1 was the owner cum driver of the said vehicle. So, it is held that the accident took place on account of rash and negligent driving of the driver of vehicle bearing No. PB-10-BX-8359, who has been arrayed as respondent No. 1. In these circumstances of the case, I find that there is no dispute with regard to the accident and claimants have deposed that respondent No. 1 was also the owner of said vehicle and he himself driving the same, when struck it with a motorcycle. So, in view of my above discussion, reasons and findings, it is held that Hakam Singh died in a road side accident on 9.2.2015 due to rash and negligent driving of the driver Jagtar Singh while driving Mohindra Maxi Truck bearing No. PB-10-BX-8359, which was also owned by him. Accordingly, issue -11- MACP-226/2015 Tej Kaur & anr. Vs. Jagtar Singh No. 1 is decided in favour of the claimants and against respondents No.1. 14.The claimant No. 1 Tej Kaur is mother of the deceased, whereas claimant No. 2 Mandeep Singh is son of the deceased. Counsel for the respondent No. 1 claims that they are not legal heirs of deceased Hakam Singh and so, are not entitled to receive any compensation on account of death of the deceased. The claimants have lead evidence while appearing in the witness box as CW1 and CW3 to prove their relationship with the deceased and no evidence in rebuttal has come on the file to hold that they are not the legal heirs of deceased Hakam Singh. Hence, in my view the claimants being mother and son of the deceased Hakam Singh are his legal representatives and are entitled to get compensation on account of death of the deceased Hakam Singh. Accordingly, issue No. 4 is decided in favour of the claimants and against respondent No. 1. 15.The present claim petition regarding death of Hakam Singh has been filed by Tej Kaur claimant No. 1 being mother and Mandeep Singh claimant no.2 being son for compensation of Rs.20 Lac being LRs and dependents of Hakam Singh. Perusal of file reveals that though Mandeep Singh claimant No. 2, while appearing as CW1 and Tej Kaur, claimant No. 1 while appearing as CW3 were put to lengthy cross examination by the counsel for the respondent no.1, but respondent No. 1 has failed to put any dent on the statement made by them that the claimants are the LRs of deceased Hakam Singh. Though it has been denied by the respondent No. 1 that Surjit Singh was not present at the time of accident, but during his cross examination while appearing as CW2, the respondent No. 1 has also failed to put any dent on the -12- MACP-226/2015 Tej Kaur & anr. Vs. Jagtar Singh statement made by him that Surjit Singh was not present at the time of accident and not seen accident in which Hakam Singh received fatal injuries in road side accident and as held above, in the above said road accident, the respondent no.1 was driving Mohindra Maxi Truck bearing no. PB-10-BX-8359. So, from the evidence on record it is clearly proved that the claimants were dependents upon the deceased Hakam Singh and therefore, I find that the claimants are entitled for compensation from the respondent No.1 16.So far as quantum of compensation is concerned, deceased Hakam Singh was 61 years of age at the time of accident as claimed and proved. The claimants have placed in their own evidence that the deceased Hakam Singh was 61 years old at the time of accident. The copy of identity card Ex.C3 and copy of driving license of the deceased Hakam Singh Ex. C4 shows his date of birth as 10.01.1954. This shows that on the date of accident, the deceased has completed 61 years of his age. The claimants have alleged that the deceased Hakam Singh was getting Rs.11,902/- per month as his pension and his said pension income has been placed and proved on record by CW4 Jagtar Singh from Ex.R2 to Ex.R5. Mandeep Singh while appearing as CW1 as well as Tej Kaur, while appearing as CW3 and Surjit Singh while appearing as CW2 proves that the pension income of the deceased at the time of his death was Rs.11,902/- per month. So, in my view in the present case, since the deceased was a retiree and so, in my view his monthly pension is to be treated as Rs.11,900/- per month and he must have used 1/2 of this for his own living expenses being a retiree and remaining 1/2 was being -13- MACP-226/2015 Tej Kaur & anr. Vs. Jagtar Singh contributed to the claimants no.1 and 2, who are his mother and son. So, total dependency comes to Rs.5,950/- per month. Hence, annual dependency of Puran Singh was Rs. 5950/- x 12= Rs.71,400/- per annum and as per guidelines given by the Hon'ble Apex Court in 'Sarla Verma vs Delhi Transport Corporation, reported in 2009 (3) R.C.R. (Civil) at page 77’, 7 is the multiplier having regard to the age of deceased at the time of accidental death. So, total loss of dependency came to Rs.4,99,800/-. In addition to that, the claimants are entitled to get Rs.25,000/- as funeral expenses and Rs.50,000/- to mother and son for loss of love and affection as per law laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court in 'Vimal Kanwar and others Vs. Kishore Dan and Others reported in 2013, ACJ, at page 1441’ . Consequently, total amount comes to Rs.5,74,800/- as compensation and respondent no.1 is liable to pay the above said amount to the claimants. Accordingly, issue No. 2 is decided in favour of the claimants and against respondent no.1. ISSUE NO.3 17.The onus to prove this issue was placed upon the respondent No.1. However, no arguments on this issue were addressed by the learned counsel for the parties. In view to my findings on issues no.1, 2 and 4 above, it is held that the claim petition as filed by the claimants for compensation is maintainable in the present form. Hence, issue no.3 is decided against the respondent No. 1 and in favour of the claimants. RELIEF 18.In view of my above discussion, reasons and findings especially on issues No.1, 2 and 4 above, the claim petition filed by the -14- MACP-226/2015 Tej Kaur & anr. Vs. Jagtar Singh claimants is accepted, with costs. Since the vehicle of the respondent No. 1 bearing registration No. PB-10-BX-8359 was not duly insured at the time of accident, so the respondent no.1 is directed to pay Rs. 5,74,800/- as total compensation along with interest @ 6% p.a. from the date of filing of petition till the date of actual payment to the claimants as compensation within three months from the date of award failing which the claimant are entitled to recover the compensation amount along with interest @ 7.5 % p.a. as mentioned above through the competent court of law. Keeping in view the age and liability of dependency of the claimants, amount of claim is distributed as under:- 1.Claimant no.1 mother 50%, 2. Claimant no.2 son 50%, Counsel fee is assessed at Rs.1500/-. Memo of costs be prepared and file be consigned to the record room. Announced in open court.

My issuewise findings are as under :- ISSUE NO.1 12.The onus to prove issue no.1 was upon the claimant. In order to prove this issue, the claimant himself appeared as PW1 and has deposed that he suffered injuries on account of the motor vehicle accident caused by rash and negligent driving of Pritam Dass respondent no.1, who was driving the truck No.PB-23M-5016. The relevant portion of his examination-in-chief is reproduced as under :- “On 23.3.2014, claimant alongwith Gurinder Since since deceased was going from Village Salu Bhaini to Lakhowal on motorcycle No.PB-10AT-9462. The said motorcycle was being driven by Gurinder Singh since deceased and the claimant was pillion rider. Gurinder Singh since deceased was driving the motorcycle on the left side of the road and at 4 Amritpal Singh Vs. Pritam Dass a moderate speed. When at about 12.30 p.m., we reached near turn of Doaba Bhaini, metalled road, near the house of one Sadhu Singh s/o S.Channan Singh, then one truck bearing No.PB-23-M-5016 which was being driven rashly and negligently by respondent no.1 Pritam Dass, came from Doaba Bhaini towards Lakhowal side, respondent no.1 brought his truck on its wrong side of the road abruptly without giving any indication and without blowing any horn, struck the said truck against the motorcycle on account of which both Gurinder Singh and the claimant fell down and received multiple accidental injuries on their person.” 13.The claimant has also proved on record file of criminal challan no.169 f 11.8.2014 pending against respondent Pritam Dass u/Ss 304-A, 279, 427 IPC registered at PS Koom Kalan vide FIR No.23 of 2014. Pritam Dass respondent no.1 has admitted in cross examination that a case with regard to accident is pending against him in the court of JMIC at Ludhiana and charge has been framed against him regarding accidental injuries to Amritpal Singh. Copy of the FIR has also been produced on record as Ex.P13 and copy of charge framed against respondent Pritam Dass is Ex.P11. So, from the evidence on record, it is proved that claimant Amritpal Singh received injuries in the road side accident due to rash and negligent driving of truck No.PB-23M-5016 by respondent no.1. so, this issue is decided in favour of the claimant and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.3 14.The onus to prove this issue was upon the respondent/Insurance Company. The driving licence of Pritam Dass was produced on record by Pritam Dass and he proved the same. The driving licence is valid from 10.2.2004 to 19.7.2019. So, as per the record, 5 Amritpal Singh Vs. Pritam Dass respondent no.1 was holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident. This issue is decided against respondent no.3. ISSUE NO.4 15.The onus to prove this issue was upon the respondent/Insurance Company. Learned counsel for the Insurance Company argued that the owner, driver and insurer of the motorcycle has not been arrayed as respondents in the present case. So, the claim petition is bad for non-joinder of necessary party. 16.From the evidence on record, it is proved that the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of offending truck by respondent no.1. As such, the owner, driver and insurer of the motorcycle is not necessary party in the present case. So, this issue is also decided against respondent no.3. ISSUE NO.2 17. The onus to prove this issue was upon the claimant. The compensation in personal injury cases is to be awarded in terms of the guidelines given in the law laid down by Hon'ble Apex Court in Raj Kumar Vs. Vijay Kumar, 2011(1) SCC 343 , as under :- Pecuniary damages (special damages) (i)Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization, medicines, transportation, nourishing food and miscellaneous expenses. (ii)Loss of earnings and other gains which injured would have made, had he not been injured comprising:- (a)loss of earning during the period of treatment, 6 Amritpal Singh Vs. Pritam Dass (b)loss of future earnings on account of permanent disability (iii)Future medical expenses. Non-pecuniary damages(general damages) (iv)Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as consequence of injuries. (v)Loss of amenities. (vi)Loss of expectation of life (shortening of normal longevity). In routine personal injury cases, compensation will be awarded only under heads (i), (ii)(a) and (iv). It is only in serious cases of injury, where there is specific medical evidence corroborating the evidence of the claimant, that compensation will be granted under any of the heads (ii)(b), (iii), (v) and (vi) relating to loss of future earnings on account of permanent disability, future medical expenses, loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage) and loss of expectation of life. Assessment of pecuniary damages under item (i) and under item (ii)(a) do not pose much difficulty as they involve reimbursement of actuals and are easily ascertainable from the evidence. Award under the head of future medical expenses – item (iii) -- depends upon specific medical evidence regarding need for further treatment and cost thereof. Assessment of non-pecuniary damages - items (iv), (v) and (vi) -- involves determination of lumpsum amounts with reference to circumstances such as age, nature of injury/deprivation/disability suffered by the claimant and the effect thereof on the future life of the claimant. Decision of this Court and High Courts contain necessary guidelines for award under these heads.” 18.Perusal of the medical record shows that the claimant remained in the hospital for 4 days from 23.3.2014 to 26.3.2014 and as 7 Amritpal Singh Vs. Pritam Dass per the consolidated bill Ex.P7, a sum of ₹27,375/- was spent on medical treatment. So, the claimant is entitled to this amount on actual basis. The claimant has alleged that he was working as manual labourer but in his cross-examination, he admitted that at that time he was a student of 10+1. So, he was not earning anything. There is no loss of earning. The claimant has not suffered any disability. There is no evidence on record that he requires treatment in future. Considering that he underwent pain and trauma for 4 days at hospitalization and during those days, he also required nourishing food and service of attendant. So, I am of the considered opinion that a sum of ₹10,000/- on account of pain and suffering, confinement in hospital, requirement of nourishing food and services attendant, is justified. So, the claimant is entitled to total compensation of ₹37,375/-. So, this issue is decided in favour of the claimant and against the respondents. RELIEF 19.In view of my findings under the aforesaid issues, the claim petition succeeds and is hereby allowed with costs and compensation to the tune of ₹37,375/- is awarded in favour of the claimant and against respondent, who shall pay this amount of compensation to the claimant within a period of two months from today alongwith interest @ 7% per annum from the date of petition till its realization, failing which the amount of compensation shall carry interest @ 9% per annum. 17.It is also ordered that the amount of compensation be deposited directly into the bank account of the claimant on his furnishing bank account details. Counsel fee is assessed as ₹ 3000/-. Memo of costs 8 Amritpal Singh Vs. Pritam Dass be prepared. File be consigned to the record room. Pronounced in open court.

The present claim petition has been filed by claimants for grant of compensation to the tune of Rs.75 lac under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act against the respondents on account of death of Gurdeep Singh in road side accident. 2.The claimants in a claim petition averred that on 21.8.2011 at 2 Amandeep Kaur Vs. Balpreet Singh about 8.30 P.M.,the deceased Gurdeep Singh was going on the road leading from village Abuwal to Bus stand Sudhar, while driving a motorcycle at slow speed and on the left side of the road. When the deceased reached near to the gate of Govt.Primary School, Abuwal at that time a Fortuner Car bearing No.PB-10CW-0079 came at fast speed and struck against the motorcycle of the deceased. As a result of this accident the deceased fell on the road alongwith his motorcycle towards the road going to the side of Sarabha and received serious injuries. He was taken to Civil Hospital, Sudhar where he was declared dead by the doctors on duty. The aforesaid Fortuner car was being driven at fast speed and in a rash and negligent manner by Balpreet Singh @ Bali respondent no.1. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of Fortuner car bearing No.Pb-10CW-0079 driven by Balpreet Singh @ Bali respondent no.1. the deceased was not at all at fault. A criminal case was registered against Balpreet Singh @ Bali for causing this accident on the basis of statement of Raghbir Singh and accordingly the claimants in the present claim petition prayed for the grant of compensation in the sum of Rs. 75 lac in favour of the claimants and against respondents jointly and severally. 3.Upon notice respondents no. 1 and 2 appeared and filed written statement preliminary objections that the claim petition is not maintainable as the claimants have no locus standi to file the present claim petition, that the respondent no.1 is having valid and legal driving licence issued on 14.4.2010 valid upto 13.4.2013 for vehicles motor car/LMV/MGV/HGV and whereas the respondent no.2 is the owner of 3 Amandeep Kaur Vs. Balpreet Singh Fortuner bearing No.Pb-10CW-0079. The respondent no.2 is having valid and existing insurance of the aforesaid vehicle and respondent no.3 HDFC ERGO General Insurance company Limited is the Insurance company of the vehicle. Hence accordingly respondent no.1 and 2 are not liable to pay the compensation if any, even otherwise his vehicle is insured with the respondent no.3 and said insurance company is liable to pay compensation if the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the accident took place due to the involvement of above vehicle of respondent no.2 and other contents of the claim petition have been denied specifically by the respondent no.1 and 2 and accordingly prayed for dismissal of claim petition. 4. Upon appearance after notice respondent no.3 Insurance Company with whom Fortuner vehicle above referred is insured with him and claimed in his written statement that the claim petition is not legally maintainable against the answering respondent. The answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimants as the respondent no.1 is driver of above said vehicle did not have valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident which is clear violation of the terms and conditions of the policy. The claim petition is bad for non joinder and mis joinder of necessary parties. The car No.Pb-10CW-0079 did not have the valid registration certificate, route permit and fitness certificate at the time of alleged accident which amounts to breach of terms and policy and in this manner respondent no.3 is not liable to pay compensation if any and accordingly after denying other averments of the claim petition in written statement and prayed for dismissal of the claim 4 Amandeep Kaur Vs. Balpreet Singh petition. 5.Replication was not preferred and from the pleadings of the parties following issues were arises and framed vide order dated 20.1.2017:- 1. Whether deceased Gurdeep Singh died on 21.8.2011 in Motor Vehicle Accident due to the rash and negligent driving of Fortuner Car bearing No.Pb-10CW-0079 being driven by respondent no.1?OPP 2.Whether the claimants are entitled to the compensation on the death of Gurdeep Singh If so, how much and from whom ?OPP 3.Whether respondent no.1 was not having valid and effective driving licence on the date of accident ?OPR3 4. Whether the vehicle No.PB-10CW-0079 had valid RC, route permit and fitness certificate at the time of accident?OPR3. 5. Whether the claim petition is not maintainable in the present form? OPR. 6. Relief. 6.In support of their claim petition, claimant no.1 Amandeep Kaur herself stepped into the witness box as CW1, and also examined CW2 Subhranshu Roy, SWO State Bank of Patiala, CW3 Raghubir Singh and thereafter closed the evidence. 7.On the other hand none of the respondents stepped into witness box to rebut the evidence of the claimants and to prove their pleas. Hence evidence of respondents no.1 and 2 closed by order vide order dated 29.8.2017. However Ld.counsel for the respondent no.3, tendered into evidence documents Ex.R1 to R10 and thereafter closed his evidence. 8.I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the material on record. My findings on the above said issues are 5 Amandeep Kaur Vs. Balpreet Singh as under: ISSUE NO.1 9.Onus to prove this issue was upon the claimants. Claimants in order to prove issue no.1 have examined CW3 Raghubir Singh eye witness of the occurrence on whose statement FIR Ex.C2 was registered and he has tendered his affidavit Ex.CW3/A. Further claimant herself appeared as CW1 Amandeep Kaur widow of deceased Gurdeep Singh. She has tendered into evidence her affidavit Ex.CW1/A in which she corroborated the version of her claim petition as well as version of CW3. In addition to above evidence of the CW1 and CW3 claimants have proved on record documentary evidence i.e., FIR Ex.C2, postmortem report of deceased Gurdeep Singh Ex.C1, election card of the deceased Ex.C3. To rebut the evidence of the claimant above referred respondent no.1 who was competent to depose about the accident has not stepped into witness box and kept away himself out of the witness box without any reason and explanation. During cross examination of CW1 and CW3 nothing came in favour of the respondents by which it may be shown that the accident was not taken place due to rash and negligent act of driving by the respondent no.1 by driving the offending vehicle rather from the oral evidence and documentary evidence it has been duly proved on record that on 21.8.2011 at about 8.30 P.M.,when the deceased Gurdeep Singh was going on road while driving his motorcycle reached near Govt.Primary School Abuwal then offending vehicle i.e.,Fortuner bearing NO.PB-10CW-0079 came with high speed driven by respondent no.1 in rash and negligent manner struck against the motorcycle of the deceased 6 Amandeep Kaur Vs. Balpreet Singh and Gurdeep Singh ultimately due to accident caused by respondent no.1 died and accordingly FIR Ex.C2 was registered against the respondent no.1. 10.However in the FIR case vide judgment Ex.R8 relied upon by the respondents, respondent no.1 has been acquitted by the Ld.trial court but the same judgment is not helpful to the respondents because the standard of proof in criminal case and in Motor Accident Claims Tribunal case are different and strict rule of civil and criminal procedure are not applicable to the proceedings initiated in Motor Accident Claims Tribunal case. The proceedings before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal are summary in nature and accordingly being the standard of proof are different in criminal court and in the Tribunal, the impact of judgment of acquittal of respondent no.1 in criminal case in the present case as per the evidence established on record against the respondent no.1, have no effect. Further driver and owner of the offending vehicle did not appear as a witness in support of their case. In the written statement they took the stand that no accident was caused with their vehicle but they failed to support their statement by any evidence. The least what they could have done was to have appeared as his own witness and supported his case subject to cross examination. Having failed to do so, an adverse inference has to be drawn against them but despite that this Tribunal is of the opinion that the negligence of driver has to be determined on the basis of evidence on the file not by mere reference to the DDR or FIR. Furthermore, none of the respondents drivers of the offending vehicle has turned up to rebut the evidence of the claimants by stepping into the 7 Amandeep Kaur Vs. Balpreet Singh witness box and in this manner mere pleas taken in the written statement denying the accident due to his fault cannot itself be considered as true as claimed. Moreover it is settled law that the cause of accident can be best explained by driver concerned and if he kept away from the witness box without sound reasons it must indeed be construed as a telling circumstance against the respondents and negligence of driver adverse inference who does not come forward to deny his negligence is liable to be drawn in favour of the claimants and against the respondents and driver is presumed to be negligent and to support this opinion this Tribunal has relied upon the citation Bhagwani Devi Vs. Krishan Kumar Saini and others 1986 KCJ 331 and Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in case titled as Raju and others Vs. Sukhwinder and others 2006(4) RCR(Civil) 82 , Krishana Vs.Tara Wati and others 2011(3) PLR,29. Hence respondent no.1 driver of the offending vehicle is held liable for causing the death of Gurdeep Singh with his vehicle Fortuner and accordingly issue no.1 is decided against the respondent no.1 and in favour of claimant. ISSUE NO.2 11.Onus to prove the issue no.2 was upon the claimants and in order to prove the issue no.2 claimant no.1 herself examined as CW1 and also examined CW2 Subhransu Roy and CW3 Ragubir Singh eye witnesses of the accident vide tendering their affidavits Ex.CW1/A, and CW3/A. There is no dispute regarding the LRS of deceased Gurdeep Singh who are claimants. No rebuttal regarding this fact has been brought on record by the respondents. Hence claimants are the only LRS of the 8 Amandeep Kaur Vs. Balpreet Singh deceased Gurdeep Singh. Further admittedly claimant during cross examination stated that her daughters claimants no.3 to 5 are already married and living with their husbands happily and in this manner nothing came on record to show that claimants no.3 to 5 were dependent on the income of the deceased Gurdeep Singh. Hence it is held that claimants no.3 to 5 were not dependent on deceased Gurdeep Singh rather after marriage they were depending upon their husbands in their matrimonial home. However claimant no.1 being widow of Gurdeep Singh deceased and Jaswinder Singh son of deceased Gurdeep Singh have been proved to be dependent on the income of the deceased Gurdeep Singh and Gurdeep Singh was drawing pension of Rs.5225/- at the time of death in accident as per Ex.CW1/2 and Ex.CW2/2 proved on record by CW2 and nothing came from the side of respondents even no suggestion have been given by the respondents to claimant no.1 during cross examination as well as to the CW2 and CW3 that the claimants no.1 and 2 were not dependent on the income of the deceased Gurdeep Singh. Hence accordingly in view of above discussion claimants no.1 and 2 are held dependent of the deceased Gurdeep Singh. 12.Further as this Tribunal has already held respondent no.1 negligent for causing the death of Gurdeep Singh by driving his Fortuner car and accordingly claimants are entitled to receive compensation and now the question is to be decided how much amount of compensation claimants are entitled and from which of the respondent and to decide this question, evidence on record and settled provisions of law are required to be discussed here. This Tribunal has found that as per Ex.P3 election card 9 Amandeep Kaur Vs. Balpreet Singh of deceased at the time of death of Gurdeep Singh he was aged of 54 years and accordingly age of deceased Gurdeep Singh at the time of death in accident was 54 years. This Tribunal has further found that as per the evidence of CW2 deceased Gurdeep Singh was drawing pension of Rs.5225/- as per Ex.CW1/1 and Ex.CW2/2. Hence it is held that per month income of Gurdeep Singh as pension at the time of his death was Rs.5225/- per month. However claimant have relied upon the Jamabandi Ex.C5 to claim the income from agriculture but after going through the Jamabandi earlier same land was mortgaged and no J-form have been proved on record to show the sale of any agriculture produce by the deceased and in the absence of the same no income can be held earned by the deceased Gurdeep Singh from agriculture work. Further there is nothing on record that except the pension Gurdeep Singh deceased earning any income from other source. Hence accordingly per month income of the deceased at the time of accident has been held as 5225/-. Further claimant no.1 is wife and claimant no.2 is son of deceased Gurdeep Singh and they are LRS and dependent on Gurdeep Singh deceased. Where the number of dependent family members of deceased are 2 to 3 then a deduction from the income of deceased i.e.,1/3 must be considered while deducting from the income of the deceased as personal and living expenses of the deceased. Further while granting compensation to the LRS appropriate selection of multiplier is required to be applied with reference of the age of the deceased for the purpose of computing the compensation amount. In case a person died in the age group between 51 to 55 years multiplier of 11 should be applied. 10 Amandeep Kaur Vs. Balpreet Singh Accordingly keeping in view of the age of deceased Gurdeep Singh 54 years multiplier of 11 is applied. To support above opinion this Tribunal has relied upon the citation Smt.Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another 2009(3) RCR(Civil),77 Supreme Court. This Tribunal is further of the opinion that due to death of Gurdeep Singh, his wife claimant no.1 is entitled to receive compensation Rs.1 lac as consortium and further son of deceased is also entitled to receive compensation Rs.1 lac for loss of love, affection, care and guidance and to support this opinion this Tribunal has relied upon the citation Kalpana Raj and others Vs. Tamil Naddu State Transport Corporation 2014(3)Civil Court Cases, Supreme Court 456, in which it has been held that deceased left behind his wife and two children compensation of Rs. 1 lac each towards loss of consortium and towards loss of love and affection awarded. Further also entitled to Rs.25,000/- as funeral expenses which might have been definitely made at the time of cremation ceremonies of the deceased Gurdeep Singh and to support this opinion this Tribunal had relied upon the citation Rajesh and other Vs. Rajbir Singh and others 2013(3) RCR(Civil) 170, Surpeme Court. There is nothing on record to show that the income of the deceased Gurdeep Singh would have been increased and there were no chance of increase the income of the deceased by way of pension. Hence accordingly the question of addition of future income does not arise and claimants are not entitled to claim compensation for the purpose of future prospect. Hence in view of the above discussion claimants are entitled to compensation amount receivable by the claimants has been calculated as 11 Amandeep Kaur Vs. Balpreet Singh follow:- Sr. No. Head Calculation 1. Income/Salary(pension) Rs.5225/- per month 2. 1/3 of above deducted as personal expenses of the deceased5225 – 1741 i.e.,1/3 = 3483.34/- per month 4. Compensation after multiplier of 11 is applied3483.34 x 11 x12 = 459800.88/-. 5. a) Loss of consortium to wife b) loss of love, affection, care and guidance of son a)Rs.1 lac to claimant no.1 b) Rs.1 lac to claimant no.2 6. Funeral expenses 25,000/- 7. cost of petition assessed Rs.3000/- Total compensation amount 6,87,800/- 13. As this Tribunal has already held that the claimants are entitled to receive the compensation amount as assessed above and now the question is to be decided from which of the respondents the claimants are entitled to receive the compensation amount and for this answer this Tribunal is of the opinion that as the offending vehicle i.e.,Fortuner of respondent no.1 owned by respondent no.2 was having validly insured with the insurance company i.e.,respondent no.3 vide insurance policy which is not disputed one rather admitted one by the respondent no.3 in para no.16 in written statement and also respondent no.1 was having valid driving licence as per Ex.R1. However contention of the respndent no.3 regarding the driving licence of respondent no.1 of the licencing authority of Govt.of Nagaland as per Ex.R6 and notification of January 2015 is liable to be considered cancelled is without merit and liable to be 12 Amandeep Kaur Vs. Balpreet Singh discarded because admittedly as per Ex.R1 respondent no.1 was holding valid driving licence at the time of accident and as per notification relied upon by the respondent no.3 driving licence holders were directed by the Govt.of Nagaland to get their driving licence converted to the smart card on or before 1.12.2014 as per notification dated 1.8.2014 and thereafter driving licence other than smart card shall be treated as cancelled meaning thereby driving licence issued by the Govt.of Nagaland till 1.12.2014 were valid and effective and thereafter if driving holder remained failed to convert the same into smart card then same was liable to be cancelled but the case in hand accident took place on 21.8.2011 and at that time respondent no.1 as per Ex.R1 was having valid and effective driving licence. Hence in this manner verification Ex.R6 and notification relied upon by counsel for the respondent no.3 has no effect on the legality and validity of the D/L of the respondent no.1. Hence nothing brought on record regarding the valid RC, route permit and fitness certificate of the offending vehicle against the respondent no.2 by the respondent no.3 and in the absence of the same without any proof led on record by the respondent no.3 it is presumed that respondent no.2 was having valid RC, fitness certificate and valid route permit. Hence all the respondents are held jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation amount to the claimants and accordingly first liability to pay the compensation amount is of the respondent no.3 with whom offending vehicle driven by respondent no.1 owned by respondent no.2 is insured and accordingly respondent no.3 is held liable to pay compensation amount to the claimants. Hence issue no.2 is decided in favour of claimants and against 13 Amandeep Kaur Vs. Balpreet Singh respondents. ISSUE NO.3 14. Onus to prove the issue no.3 was on the respondents for which respondents remained failed to prove the same. Moreover, in view of the above discussion in issue no.2 it has already been held that respondent no.1 was having valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident and accordingly issue no.3 is decided in favour of the respondent no.1 and against the respondent no.3. ISSUE NO.4 15.Onus to prove this issues no.4 was on the respondent no.3 and it is already held by this Tribunal that respondent no.2 was having valid RC, fitness certificate and route permit. Hence accordingly issue no.4 is decided in favour of the respondent no.2 and claimants but against the respondent no.3. ISSUE NO.5 16.Onus to prove the issue no.5 was upon the respondents but same has not been proved. Rather the claimants have proved on record that death of Gurdeep Singh was caused due to rash and negligent act of driving by respondent no.1 by driving offending vehicle owned by respondent no.2 insured with respondent no.3 and accordingly claimants are LR of the deceased and present claim petition is duly maintainable and accordingly issue no.5 is decided in favour of claimants and against the respondents. Relief. 17.In view of findings on the above said issues, the claim 14 Amandeep Kaur Vs. Balpreet Singh petition in hand succeeds and award of Rs. 6,87,800/- with costs is passed in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. The aforesaid compensation amount shall be apportioned among the claimants as under: 1) Amandeep Kaur (wife) :Rs.3,43,900/- 2) Jaswinder Singh(son) :Rs.3,43,900/- It is further directed that the claimants are entitled to receive the compensation amount as assessed above @ 6% per annum from the date of filing of claim petition till the date of award and the respondents shall pay the compensation amount to the claimants within 2 months from the date of award after receipt of certified copy of award. If the respondents remained failed to pay the compensation amount to the claimants as directed above thereafter claimants shall be entitled to receive the compensation amount with interest @ 9% per annum till its actual realization. The share of awarded amount of compensation alongwith interest of claimants be disbursed to claimants directly in their savings bank accounts by the respondents, the particulars of which will be supplied to the respondents by the claimants within 10 days from the date of receipt of certified copy of this award.

My issue wise findings are as under: ISSUE NO. 1 to 7 . 9- All these issues are interconnected and interlinked and therefore, I take them together for discussion. 10- Learned counsel for the claimant has advanced the arguments that the claimant received injuries in an accident caused by respondent no.1 Saminder Singh while driving Bolero Maxi truck bearing registration no. PB-10-ES-2423 in a rash and negligent manner. The claimant suffered injuries on his body. The claimant remained confined to bed for long nine months and was unable to move. He remained admitted in the hospital firstly from 13.6.15 to 17.6.15 and thereafter, again had undergone surgery and has lost his job. Therefore, he is entitled to compensation on the basis of the injuries suffered by him for pain and suffering, for loss of income for the period he remained under medication and even remained hospitalized for the charges of the attendant and the special diet and thus, prayed for compensation to the tune of Rs.10,00,000/- alongwith interest . 11- It is the case of the claimant that on 13.6.15, he was going on his bicycle to GT Road, Ludhiana .

Thereafter, he left Global Hospital and joined Fortis hospital. The patient again came with non union of left femur on 4.11.15 and was operated in the form of implant readjustment and bone grafting. He was admitted on 4.11.15 and was discharged on 5.11.15. He remained in regular OPD follow ups. He proved treatment record of Global Hospital of Varinder Kumar as Ex. CW2/D and Ex. CW3/A. 15-On the other hand, the respondents tendered into evidence Ex. R1 copy of insurance policy, Ex. R2 copy of registration certificate of vehicle no. PB-10-ES-2423, Ex. R3 copy of driving licence of Saminder Singh and Ex. R4 certificate issued by the office of Regional Transport Sonia Kinra/MACT/Ldh/17.11.17. Varinder Kumar v Saminder Singh Page no. 13 of 13 Officer, Patiala. 16-It has been proved by CW1 claimant Varinder Kumar , CW2 Dr. Shashikant and CW3 Dr. Neeraj Bansal that the claimant received injuries in an accident caused by rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 while driving truck bearing registration no. PB-10-ES-2423. Even FIR no.129/2015 under Sections 279/337/338/427 IPC, PS City Jagraon has been proved by the claimant as Ex. C1. 17-Now the question crops up with regard to the compensation to which the claimant is entitled to. Learned counsel for respondent no. 3 has raised the contention that there is no proof with regard to income of the injured and there is no permanent disability proved on the record. Even the bills before 4.7.15 are to be taken into consideration as on 4.7.15, as per medical record Ex. CW2/D, the claimant was admitted due to fall and it is reflected in the history of the claimant. Thus, any treatment after 4.7.15 cannot be said to be linked with the accident caused by respondent no. 1. This argument of learned counsel for respondent no. 3 is not convincing as it has come in the evidence of the claimant that earlier, in the accident, he received injury on his left leg and even it was operated upon twice and there was implantation but the same failed and thus, it was mentioned that he came with the history of fall at home. Even the fall thereafter due to which he was admitted in the hospital on 30.6.15 is the continuation of the injury received by him in the accident caused by respondent no. 1 on 13.6.15. It is the admitted fact that the claimant remained admitted in the hospital from 13.6.15 to 17.6.15 and then from 30.6.15 to 3.7.15 and it has been even proved by CW2 Dr. Shashikant and CW3 Dr. Neeraj Bansal. The claimant has also proved the bills Ex.C2 to Ex. C24 of the expenses of the hospital and the bills for medicines issued by Global Heart and Superspeciality Hospital and Fortis Hospital and Global Drug Store and Ace Diagnostics reflecting that the amount of Rs.1,34,8129/- was spent on his treatment. 18-The claimant has also claimed that he has suffered permanent disability but he has not been able to produce any document/certificate Sonia Kinra/MACT/Ldh/17.11.17. Varinder Kumar v Saminder Singh Page no. 13 of 13 with regard to same. In injury cases arising out of motor accident, the damages may vary according to the gravity of the injuries. There is no denial to the fact that injuries cause deprivation to the body which result in losses entitling the claimant to claim damages. The damages can be pecuniary as well as non pecuniary. The Court has to make a judicious attempt to award the damages so as to compensate the claimant for the loss suffered by her/him. Pecuniary damages may include expenses incurred by the claimant on medical treatment, attendant, transportation, special diet etc., and actual loss of earning of profit upto the date of trial, future loss of earning . Non pecuniary damages include damages for mental and physical shock, pain and suffering already suffered or likely to be suffered in future and damages to compensate for the loss of amenities of life which may include a verity of matter i.e on account of injuries, the claimant may not be able to walk run or sit. My this view is fortified by the case law reported as R. D. Hattangadi vs M/s. Pest Control (India) Pvt. AIR 1995 SC 755 wherein it has been held that while fixing an amount of compensation payable to a victim of an accident, the damages have to be assessed separately as pecuniary damages and special damages. Pecuniary damages are those which the victim has actually incurred and which is capable of being calculated in terms of money, whereas non-pecuniary damages are those which are incapable of being assessed by arithmetical calculations. In order to appreciate two concepts pecuniary damages may, include expenses incurred by the claimant: (I) medical attendance; (ii) loss of earning of profit upto the date of trial ; (iii) other material loss. So far non-pecuniary damages are concerned, they may include (i) damages for mental and physical shock, pain suffering, already suffered or likely to be suffered in future; (ii) damages to compensate for the loss of amenities of life which may include a variety of matters i.e. on account of injury the claimant may not be able to walk, run or sit; (iii) damages for the loss of expectation of life, i.e on account of injury the normal longevity of the person concerned is shortened, (iv) inconvenience, hardship, discomfort, disappointment, Sonia Kinra/MACT/Ldh/17.11.17. Varinder Kumar v Saminder Singh Page no. 13 of 13 frustration and mental stress in life. Further, in broad terms, the compensation as held in the case law reported as R. D. Hattangadi supra is awarded as follows: COMPENSATION FOR INJURY AND PAIN 19-From the evidence led by the claimant, it is clear that the claimant remained admitted in Global Heart and Superspeciality Hospital , Ludhiana from 13.6.15 to 17.6.15 and then from 30.6.15 to 3.7.15 . During this period, he must have undergone considerable pain and inconvenience because of the accident. Therefore, I access the compensation under this head as Rs. 9,000/-. COMPENSATION FOR EXPENSES INCURRED ON MEDICAL TREATMENT . 20-As discussed above, the expenditure incurred by the claimant on account of his treatment and purchase of medicines as reflected in bills Ex. C2 to Ex. C24 reflects that an amount of Rs. Rs. 1,34,819/- was spent by the claimant on his treatment and therefore, the amount of compensation for expenses incurred on medical treatment comes to Rs.1,34,819/-. COMPENSATION ON ACCOUNT OF LOSS OF PROSPECTIVE INCOME 21-The claimant has claimed himself to be in private job and has claimed himself to be earning Rs. 12,000/- per month. He has not placed on record any document to prove his income. He has been cross examined on this aspect and has not been able to prove his income to be Rs.12,000/- per month. Hence, his income is assessed as that of a labourer i.e. Rs. 5,000/- per month. It has also been proved that he remained admitted in the hospital from 13.6.15 to 17.6.15 and 30.6.15 to 3.7.15 i.e. for nine days. However, he remained confined to bed even after discharge from hospital on 17.6.15 and thereafter, the implantment failed and he was again admitted on 30.6.15 and discharged on 3.7.15 and was operated Sonia Kinra/MACT/Ldh/17.11.17. Varinder Kumar v Saminder Singh Page no. 13 of 13 again. Though it has not been proved on record that he has suffered permanent disability but it has been proved that he has been operated twice, there has been implantation in his leg and it even failed due to which he again had a fall and remained admitted in the hospital. It all leads to safe inference that he has a loss of prospective income in future. For the said loss, I grant him compensation to the tune of Rs. 1,00,000/-. ATTENDANT CHARGES 22-Now coming to the compensation on account of attendant charges which must have been incurred for the period, the claimant remained under treatment and hospitalized in the hospital. The claimant must have not been able to manage the regular movement due to the nature of the injuries sustained by him as it is the version of the claimant that he received injury on his leg and could not walk properly. In view of the gravity of the injury sustained by him, his routine work must have been effected and he would have required attendant. In my view, the attendant charges in lump sum amounting to Rs. 5,000/- is awarded to the claimant. LOSS OF AMENITIES OF LIFE 23-Claimant Varinder Kumar was aged about 45 years at the time of the accident. His medical record reveals that he suffered injuries on his body and even there was implant in his left thigh. He was operated twice. As such, it is presumed that due to disability, daily routine activities of the claimant have been effected and he would not be in a position to engage himself in any normal activity performed by the persons of his group. Further, with the advancement of the age, generally there is increase in society and official responsibility due to which exchange, visits are to be made which in this case would not be possible due to suffering. Even he suffered mental and physical shock on account of the injuries on his person, therefore, he is entitled for non pecuniary Sonia Kinra/MACT/Ldh/17.11.17. Varinder Kumar v Saminder Singh Page no. 13 of 13 damages . Accordingly, he is awarded lump sum compensation of Rs.50,000/- under this head. 24-With the above discussion, the claimant has proved that he received injuries due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 while driving truck bearing registration no. PB-10-ES-2423 which was insured with respondent no.3 at the relevant time. Hence, the respondents are liable to pay compensation assessed to the claimant. However, respondents no.1 and 2 are entitled to recover the same from respondent no. 3. Thus, in the light of the above discussion and finding, issues no. 1 and 2 are decided accordingly in favour of the claimant and against the respondents and issues no. 3 to 7 are decided against the respondents and in favour of the claimant. AWARD 25- Thus, in sequel to my above discussion , the claim petition of the claimant is partly allowed with costs and an award is passed in favour of the claimant and against respondents no. 1 and 2 . The driver and registered owner i.e respondents no.1 and 2 are primarily responsible to pay this compensation. Therefore, they are directed to pay the amount of Rs. 2,98,819/- (Rupees Two Lacs Ninety Eight Thousand and Eight Hundred Nineteen Only) ( Rs.1,34,819 /- + Rs.9,000/- + Rs. 1,00,000/- + Rs. 5,000/- + Rs. 50,000/- ) alongwith interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of claim petition till realization. They are liable jointly and severally towards the claimant. They are also entitled to recover the same from respondent no. 3 Insurance company. Counsel fee is assessed to Rs.2,200/-. (Rupees Two thousand and two hundred only). Memo of costs be prepared. File be consigned to the record room after due compilation. Pronounced:17.11.2017.

Harwinderpal Singh Advocate for the claimants. Sh. L.S.Rai Adv, for respondent no.1 and 2 Sh.Vyom Bansal Adv. for respondent no.3 AWARD: 1. The claimants have filed the present claim petition under section 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act,(here-in-after referred to as the “Act”) for the grant of compensation to the tune of Rs. 25 lacs along with interest and costs against the respondents with regard to death of Anil Kumar Ghai son of Jagdish Miter Ghai in motor vehicle accident, caused by respondent No.1 on 20.09.2014. 2.Factual syntax of the case in hand as emerged from the claim petition is that FIR No.109 dated 27.9.2014 under section 279/337/338/427 IPC and 304A IPC(Added later on) at P.S.PAU Ludhiana was registered on the complaint of Arun Kumar Ghai, brother of the deceased Anil Kumar Ghai son of Jagdish Mitter Ghai, R/o H.No.B-VI- 1662, Rari Mohalla Near Suhani Building, Ludhiana on the averment that on 20.9.2014 when he went to the house of his brother deceased Anil Kumar Ghai, after taking the meal at night about 9.15PM. When he was returning from his home on his Mastro Scooter, Anil Kumar Ghai went to purchase Ice Cream for his children on his Activa Honda bearing No.PB- 10CG-3677. It is further averred that complainant Arun Kumar Ghai was behind 20 to 25 yards from Anil Kumar Ghai, when he diverted from Barewal Road to Ferozepur Road, Near Gurdev Nagar, Ludhiana towards City side, then one car Verna bearing registration no.PB-27C-7777 being 3 driven by respondent no.1 in negligent and rash manner, hit the Activa of Anil Kumar Ghai, due to this reason he fell down from his scooter and he received injuries and Activa also got damaged. Driver of Verna Car escaped from the spot with the car. Arun Kumar Ghai informed claimants no.1,3 and 4 from the spot and also informed to the Ambulance by dialing no.108. Anil Kumar was taken to DMC Hospital through the Ambulance and he was admitted in the hospital for treatment, where he died on 27.9.2014. It is averred that aforesaid accident took place due to the negligence of the driver of the car mentioned above. It is further averred that offending vehicle I.e Verna car bearing registration no.PB- 27C-7777 since owned by respondent no.2 and the same was insured with respondent no.3. On the basis of aforesaid pleadings,Claimants have sought compensation amounting to Rs.25,00,000/- on account of death of Anil Kumar Ghai along with interest at the rate of 24% per annum from the date of accident till its realization. 3.Pursuant to notice of this claim petition served on the respondents, the respondents No.1 and 2 appeared and filed their joint written statements taking preliminary objections that regarding maintainability, concealment of true and material facts. On merits, the occurrence of accident is denied. It is averred that no accident took place with car no.PB-27C-7777 as alleged by the claimants. The remaining averments in the claim petition have been denied except the fact that Vehicle in question is insured with respondent no.3 I.e Megma General Insurance Company. 4.Pursuant to the notice, the respondents No.3 Insurance 4 Company also appeared through counsel and filed separate written statement taking the preliminary objections regarding maintainability of the claim petition. It is averred in the written statement that claim petition has been filed by the claimants in connivance and collusion with other respondent to extract easy money from the Insurance Company. The vehicle no.PB-27-C-7777 was not involved in the alleged accident and the same has been falsely implicated. It is further averred that Gurinder Singh had lodged a FIR No.121 dated 24.9.2014 with P.S.Sudhar Ludhiana for theft of aforesaid car on 20.9.2014. Thereafter, police registered a FIR no.125 dated 30.9.2014 with P.S.Sudhar, Ludhiana against Gurinder Singh under section 183,199,420 IPC for lodging wrong FIR bearing no.121. On merits, all the remaining averments of the claim petition has been denied and Lastly, a prayer for dismissal of the claim petition has been made. 5.The pleadings of the parties gave rise to the following issues on 23.11.2015:- 1.Whether deceased Anil Kumar Ghai died due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 in driving the Verna Car bearing no.27C-7777?OPP 2.If issue no.1 is proved in affirmative, whether the claimants are entitled to recover the compensation, if so, from which of the respondents and to what amount?OPP 3.Whether the present petition is not maintainable?OPR 5 4.Relief. 6.In order to prove her case, the claimant No.1 Meena Ghai examined herself as CW1 and tendered into evidence her duly sworn affidavit Ex.CW1/A alongwith documents Ex.P1 to Ex.P11 and examined Arun Kumar Ghai as PW2, who tendered into evidence her duly sworn affidavit Ex.CW2/A, Sh.Tilak Raj Senior Supervisor DMC Hospital as CW3 and thereafter counsel for the claimant tendered into claimant evidence Copy of Aadhar Card of deceased as Ex.CX and closed the claimant evidence. 7. On the other hand, counsel for respondent no.1 and 2 did not step into the witness box in support of their averments and as such, the evidence of respondents no.1 and 2 was closed by order. Counsel for respondent no.3 tendered into evidence documents Ex.R3/A to Ex.R3/C and closed the evidence on behalf of respondent no.3. 8.I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have also examined the record of the case. My issue-wise findings are as under:- ISSUE NO.1: Whether deceased Anil Kumar Ghai died due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 in driving the Verna Car bearing no.27C-7777?OPP 9.Meena Ghai claimant no.1 herself stepped into witness box as CW1 and tendered her affidavit Ex.CW1/A and reiterating the facts mentioned in the petition. Admittedly Meena Ghai is not the eye witness of the accident in question. As per the version of claimants, CW2 Arun Kumar Ghai is the eye witness of the accident caused by respondent no.1 6 while driving his Verna Car PB-27C-7777. As per the deposition of CW2 Arun Kumar Ghai, on 20.9.2014 he went to the house of his brother Anil Kumar, now deceased, after taking the meals at night about 9.15PM and when he was returning for his home on his Mastro Scooter, Anil Kumar went to purchase Ice Cream for his children on his Activa Honda bearing no.PB-10CG-3677. CW2 Arun Kumar Ghai further deposed in his examination in chief that he was behind 20/25 yards from his brother Anil Kumar Ghai and his brother started diverting from Barewal Road through Ferozepur Road near Gurdev Nagar Ludhiana towards City side. At that time, one car Verna bearing registration no.PB-27C-7777 being driven by respondent no.1, in rash and negligent manner hit the Activa of Anil Kumar Ghai and due to this reason he fell down from his scooter and received injures on his person. CW2 further deposed that driver of Verna car escaped from the spot with the car. 10.Ld. Counsel for the claimants have vehemently argued that deposition of eye witness, CW2 Arun Kumar Ghai coupled with the fact that FIR was lodged against respondent no.1 Gurwinder Singh @ Guri and challan was submitted against him. It is manifest from the aforesaid evidence that respondent no.1 was rash and negligent in driving the vehicle. In support of his argument he placed reliance upon the judgment titled Gurdeep Kaur Vs Tarsem Singh,2008(2)RCR(Civil)774. He further argued that delay in lodging of FIR is not a ground to cast suspicion on the case of the claimants. To strengthen his argument, he placed reliance upon the judgment titled National Insurance Company Limited Erode Vs. Seetha Minor and 7 others,2014(5)RCR,Civil,117(Madras), Oriental Insurance Company Limited Vs. Hoshiar Singh and others,2014(5)RCR,Civil,806(P&H). 11.On the contrary Ld. Counsel for the Insurance Company has vehemently argued that vehicle Verna car bearing no.27C-7777 has been falsely implicated to extract money from the Insurance Company. He further argued that alleged accident took place on 20.9.2014 whereas the statement was made to the police after the gap of 7 days on 27.9.2014. He brought the attention of the Tribunal on the recovery memo attached with the challan Ex.RW3/A, according to which the alleged vehicle was recovered on 27.9.2014 from the place of occurrence. He further submitted that as per the FIR and statement of Arun Kumar Ghai before the police and deposition before the Tribunal, the driver of car in question fled away from the spot alongwith car. As such, there was no occasion for the Investigating Officer to recover the car from the alleged place of accident after gap of 7 days. He further submitted that insured vehicle has been implicated for extracting the claim amount from the Insurance Company. In support of his argument he placed reliance in case titled Hira Singh and others Vs. Rajpal @ Raju and others,FAO No.6144 of 2010 decided on 15.1.2016 (P&H). 12.I have heard the rival contentions of the parties. 13.Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in case titled Gurdeep Kaur Vs. Tarsem Singh(Supra) after referring the case titled Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Shyam and others 1993(2) PLR 109 , has held that if the driver is being tried, on account of the rash and negligent driving in a criminal case, in a court of law, it is prima facie safe to hold, 8 that the accident occurred on account of his rash and negligent act. It is further held that by the Hon'ble High Court that the strict principles of Civil Procedure Code, and the Evidence Act, are not applicable to the enquires, required to be made, in motor accident claim cases. The Tribunal is required to evolve its own procedure, which may be in consonance with the broad principles of natural justice. 14.In Hira Singh and others versus Rajpal alias Raju and others FAO No. 6144 of 2010 date of decision 15.01.2016, Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court has held as under “There is no dispute with the proposition of law that in a claim petition filed under section 166 of the Act it is incumbent upon the claimants to establish the rash and negligent driving on the part of the driver of the vehicle. Further, the identity of the vehicle and its driver involved in the accident has to be established.” 15. There is no doubt that respondent no. 1 Gurwinder Singh @ Guri is facing trial in FIR No. 109 dated 27.09.2014 under section 279,338,427,304-A IPC Police Staion PAU Ludhiana for allegedly causing accident with vehicle PB-27C-7777. But the question remains whether claimants have established the identity of the vehicle and its driver involved in the accident. 16. CW2 Arun Kumar Ghai has deposed that accident took place on 20.09.2014 at the diversion of Barewal road to Ferozepur Road, Near Gurdev Nagar Ludhiana. He further deposed that driver (respondent no.1) of Verna Car bearing registration No. PB27-C-7777 came in negligent and rash manner and hit the Activa of Anil Kumar Ghai (deceased). Due to the 9 aforesaid impact Anil Kumar Ghai fell on the ground. He further deposed that driver of Verna car escaped from the spot with the car. Thereafter Anil Kumar Ghai was shifted to the hospital where he died on 27.09.2014. 17. It is pertinent to mention here that FIR in the present case was lodged on 27.09.2014 i.e. after a gap of seven days of the occurrence. The counsel for the insurance company has tendered certified copy of Challan of the criminal case in which respondent no. 1 is facing trial. As per the copy of challan, police received the telephonic message regarding the accident on 26.09.2014 and on that day medical ruqa was collected from the PP DMC Ludhiana. A perusal of the ruqa attached with the certified copy of challan goes to show that concerned doctor issued the ruqa on 14.09.2014 i.e. a date prior to the alleged accident and the same was collected by the police on 26.09.2014.This discrepancy creates a suspicion in the claim of the claimants. It is pertinent to mention here that claimants got examined Tilak Raj, Senior Supervisor of DMC Hospital, who deposed that Anil Kumar Ghai was admitted in the DMC Hospital on 20.09.2014 and discharged on 27.09.2014 and he proved the bills EX CW 3/1 to Ex CW3/12 regarding the admission of Anil Kumar Ghai in the Hospital. However he has not produced the MLR of the Anil Kumar Ghai which can suggest that he received the injuries on 20.09.2014. There is no evidence which could clear the air how the medical ruqa was issued from the date prior to the the date of alleged accident. 18. The Post Mortem Report ( part of challan EX R3/A) depicts that Anil Kumar Ghai died on 27.09.2014 at 4.07 as per hospital record. The doctor has opined that cause of death in this case is due to septicemia 10 shock which is sufficient to cause death in an ordinary course of nature. The onus was on the complainant to prove that septicemia was developed due to the injuries sustained in a road side accident. Claimants have not produced the record of the MLR and treatment chart of the deceased which can show that septicemia developed in the body of deceased due the injuries sustained in the alleged road side accident. 19. As per the evidence of CW-2 Arun Kumar Ghai, after the accident on 20.09.2014, the driver of Verna car bearing no. PB-27C-7777 fled away from the spot along with the car. FIR was lodged on the statement of Arun Kumar Ghai and police visited the occurrence on the same day I.e 27.09.2014. Surprisingly police got recovered the alleged offending car PB-27 C-7777 and scooter of deceased from the spot after the gap of seven days. There is no explanation how the vehicle bearing no. PB-27C-7777 found on the spot when CW2 has stated that driver of the aforesaid car fled away from the spot along with his vehicle. I have gone through the recovery memo dated 27.09.2014 ( part of the challan EX R3/A) vide which both the vehicles were taken into possession at spot. The recovery memo finds mention the name of the accused as Gurinder Singh @ Guri. At the time of the alleged recovery of the offending vehicle at the spot, there was no clue or reason with the investigating officer of the case to come at the conclusion that Gurinder Singh was the accused in the aforesaid criminal case. It is beyond comprehension how investigating officer got recorded the name of the accused on the recovery memo. The collusion between the claimants and the respondents no.1 and 2 is evident from the fact that Gurinder Singh 11 had also lodged an FIR no.121 dated 24.9.2014 with P.S.Sudhar Ludhiana for the theft of the alleged offending car on 20.9.2014. It appears the purpose of the whole exercise is to secure compensation in the present claim petition and thereafter to earn acquittal in the criminal trial. 20. Learned counsel for the claimants have argued the delay in lodging the FIR is not ground to reject the claim of the claimants. He further argued that CW 2 Arun Kumar Ghai has deposed that he kept contacting the police official from 20.09.2014 till his statement was recorded on phone. Learned counsel further submitted that accident cannot be doubted merely on ground of delay in lodging FIR. 21. There is no doubt that mere delay in lodging the FIR is not a ground for rejecting the claim of the claimants, but claimants are bound to prove the accident, identity of vehicle and its driver involved in the accident. However, in the present case the claimants have failed to prove the accident, identity of vehicle and its driver due to the aforesaid discussion. 22.Therefore, this court has no hesitation to hold that claimants have failed to prove that deceased suffered accidental injuries on 20.09.2014. The claimants have failed to adduce any cogent and convincing evidence to prove the involvement of alleged vehicle. After considering the entire conspectus of the material placed on the file I am of the considered view that claimants have failed to prove that Anil Kumar Ghai died due to the accidental injuries due to the accident with Verna Car bearing no.PB-27C-7777. Accordingly, issue No.1 is decided against the claimants and in favour of respondents. 12 Issues No.2 and 3: - 23.Onus to prove issue no.2 was upon the claimants and issue no.3 was upon the respondents. In view of the findings recorded under issue no.1, these issue have become redundant. Relief 24.As a result of my discussion above, the present claim petition filed by the claimants is hereby dismissed with costs. Memo of cost be prepared. Pleader fee is assessed at Rs. 1000/-. File be consigned to the Record Room. Pronounced in open Court DINESH KUMAR 27.04.2016 Motor Accident Claims Tribunal Ludhiana"

It is further averred that complainant Arun Kumar Ghai was behind 20 to 25 yards from Anil Kumar Ghai, when he diverted from Barewal Road to Ferozepur Road, Near Gurdev Nagar, Ludhiana towards City side, then one car Verna bearing registration no.PB-27C-7777 being 3 driven by respondent no.1 in negligent and rash manner, hit the Activa of Anil Kumar Ghai, due to this reason he fell down from his scooter and he received injuries and Activa also got damaged. Driver of Verna Car escaped from the spot with the car. Arun Kumar Ghai informed claimants no.1,3 and 4 from the spot and also informed to the Ambulance by dialing no.108. Anil Kumar was taken to DMC Hospital through the Ambulance and he was admitted in the hospital for treatment, where he died on 27.9.2014.

It is further averred that offending vehicle I.e Verna car bearing registration no.PB- 27C-7777 since owned by respondent no.2 and the same was insured with respondent no.3. On the basis of aforesaid pleadings,Claimants have sought compensation amounting to Rs.25,00,000/- on account of death of Anil Kumar Ghai along with interest at the rate of 24% per annum from the date of accident till its realization. 3.Pursuant to notice of this claim petition served on the respondents, the respondents No.1 and 2 appeared and filed their joint written statements taking preliminary objections that regarding maintainability, concealment of true and material facts. On merits, the occurrence of accident is denied. It is averred that no accident took place with car no.PB-27C-7777 as alleged by the claimants. The remaining averments in the claim petition have been denied except the fact that Vehicle in question is insured with respondent no.3 I.e Megma General Insurance Company. 4.Pursuant to the notice, the respondents No.3 Insurance 4 Company also appeared through counsel and filed separate written statement taking the preliminary objections regarding maintainability of the claim petition. It is averred in the written statement that claim petition has been filed by the claimants in connivance and collusion with other respondent to extract easy money from the Insurance Company. The vehicle no.PB-27-C-7777 was not involved in the alleged accident and the same has been falsely implicated. It is further averred that Gurinder Singh had lodged a FIR No.121 dated 24.9.2014 with P.S.Sudhar Ludhiana for theft of aforesaid car on 20.9.2014. Thereafter, police registered a FIR no.125 dated 30.9.2014 with P.S.Sudhar, Ludhiana against Gurinder Singh under section 183,199,420 IPC for lodging wrong FIR bearing no.121. On merits, all the remaining averments of the claim petition has been denied and Lastly, a prayer for dismissal of the claim petition has been made. 5.The pleadings of the parties gave rise to the following issues on 23.11.2015:- 1.Whether deceased Anil Kumar Ghai died due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 in driving the Verna Car bearing no.27C-7777?OPP 2.If issue no.1 is proved in affirmative, whether the claimants are entitled to recover the compensation, if so, from which of the respondents and to what amount?OPP 3.Whether the present petition is not maintainable?OPR 5 4.Relief. 6.In order to prove her case, the claimant No.1 Meena Ghai examined herself as CW1 and tendered into evidence her duly sworn affidavit Ex.CW1/A alongwith documents Ex.P1 to Ex.P11 and examined Arun Kumar Ghai as PW2, who tendered into evidence her duly sworn affidavit Ex.CW2/A, Sh.Tilak Raj Senior Supervisor DMC Hospital as CW3 and thereafter counsel for the claimant tendered into claimant evidence Copy of Aadhar Card of deceased as Ex.CX and closed the claimant evidence. 7. On the other hand, counsel for respondent no.1 and 2 did not step into the witness box in support of their averments and as such, the evidence of respondents no.1 and 2 was closed by order. Counsel for respondent no.3 tendered into evidence documents Ex.R3/A to Ex.R3/C and closed the evidence on behalf of respondent no.3. 8.I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have also examined the record of the case. My issue-wise findings are as under:- ISSUE NO.1: Whether deceased Anil Kumar Ghai died due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 in driving the Verna Car bearing no.27C-7777?OPP 9.Meena Ghai claimant no.1 herself stepped into witness box as CW1 and tendered her affidavit Ex.CW1/A and reiterating the facts mentioned in the petition. Admittedly Meena Ghai is not the eye witness of the accident in question. As per the version of claimants, CW2 Arun Kumar Ghai is the eye witness of the accident caused by respondent no.1 6 while driving his Verna Car PB-27C-7777. As per the deposition of CW2 Arun Kumar Ghai, on 20.9.2014 he went to the house of his brother Anil Kumar, now deceased, after taking the meals at night about 9.15PM and when he was returning for his home on his Mastro Scooter, Anil Kumar went to purchase Ice Cream for his children on his Activa Honda bearing no.PB-10CG-3677. CW2 Arun Kumar Ghai further deposed in his examination in chief that he was behind 20/25 yards from his brother Anil Kumar Ghai and his brother started diverting from Barewal Road through Ferozepur Road near Gurdev Nagar Ludhiana towards City side. At that time, one car Verna bearing registration no.PB-27C-7777 being driven by respondent no.1, in rash and negligent manner hit the Activa of Anil Kumar Ghai and due to this reason he fell down from his scooter and received injures on his person. CW2 further deposed that driver of Verna car escaped from the spot with the car. 10.Ld. Counsel for the claimants have vehemently argued that deposition of eye witness, CW2 Arun Kumar Ghai coupled with the fact that FIR was lodged against respondent no.1 Gurwinder Singh @ Guri and challan was submitted against him. It is manifest from the aforesaid evidence that respondent no.1 was rash and negligent in driving the vehicle. In support of his argument he placed reliance upon the judgment titled Gurdeep Kaur Vs Tarsem Singh,2008(2)RCR(Civil)774. He further argued that delay in lodging of FIR is not a ground to cast suspicion on the case of the claimants. To strengthen his argument, he placed reliance upon the judgment titled National Insurance Company Limited Erode Vs. Seetha Minor and 7 others,2014(5)RCR,Civil,117(Madras), Oriental Insurance Company Limited Vs. Hoshiar Singh and others,2014(5)RCR,Civil,806(P&H). 11.On the contrary Ld. Counsel for the Insurance Company has vehemently argued that vehicle Verna car bearing no.27C-7777 has been falsely implicated to extract money from the Insurance Company. He further argued that alleged accident took place on 20.9.2014 whereas the statement was made to the police after the gap of 7 days on 27.9.2014. He brought the attention of the Tribunal on the recovery memo attached with the challan Ex.RW3/A, according to which the alleged vehicle was recovered on 27.9.2014 from the place of occurrence. He further submitted that as per the FIR and statement of Arun Kumar Ghai before the police and deposition before the Tribunal, the driver of car in question fled away from the spot alongwith car. As such, there was no occasion for the Investigating Officer to recover the car from the alleged place of accident after gap of 7 days. He further submitted that insured vehicle has been implicated for extracting the claim amount from the Insurance Company. In support of his argument he placed reliance in case titled Hira Singh and others Vs. Rajpal @ Raju and others,FAO No.6144 of 2010 decided on 15.1.2016 (P&H). 12.I have heard the rival contentions of the parties. 13.Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in case titled Gurdeep Kaur Vs. Tarsem Singh(Supra) after referring the case titled Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Shyam and others 1993(2) PLR 109 , has held that if the driver is being tried, on account of the rash and negligent driving in a criminal case, in a court of law, it is prima facie safe to hold, 8 that the accident occurred on account of his rash and negligent act. It is further held that by the Hon'ble High Court that the strict principles of Civil Procedure Code, and the Evidence Act, are not applicable to the enquires, required to be made, in motor accident claim cases. The Tribunal is required to evolve its own procedure, which may be in consonance with the broad principles of natural justice. 14.In Hira Singh and others versus Rajpal alias Raju and others FAO No. 6144 of 2010 date of decision 15.01.2016, Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court has held as under “There is no dispute with the proposition of law that in a claim petition filed under section 166 of the Act it is incumbent upon the claimants to establish the rash and negligent driving on the part of the driver of the vehicle. Further, the identity of the vehicle and its driver involved in the accident has to be established.” 15. There is no doubt that respondent no. 1 Gurwinder Singh @ Guri is facing trial in FIR No. 109 dated 27.09.2014 under section 279,338,427,304-A IPC Police Staion PAU Ludhiana for allegedly causing accident with vehicle PB-27C-7777. But the question remains whether claimants have established the identity of the vehicle and its driver involved in the accident. 16. CW2 Arun Kumar Ghai has deposed that accident took place on 20.09.2014 at the diversion of Barewal road to Ferozepur Road, Near Gurdev Nagar Ludhiana. He further deposed that driver (respondent no.1) of Verna Car bearing registration No. PB27-C-7777 came in negligent and rash manner and hit the Activa of Anil Kumar Ghai (deceased). Due to the 9 aforesaid impact Anil Kumar Ghai fell on the ground. He further deposed that driver of Verna car escaped from the spot with the car. Thereafter Anil Kumar Ghai was shifted to the hospital where he died on 27.09.2014. 17. It is pertinent to mention here that FIR in the present case was lodged on 27.09.2014 i.e. after a gap of seven days of the occurrence. The counsel for the insurance company has tendered certified copy of Challan of the criminal case in which respondent no. 1 is facing trial. As per the copy of challan, police received the telephonic message regarding the accident on 26.09.2014 and on that day medical ruqa was collected from the PP DMC Ludhiana. A perusal of the ruqa attached with the certified copy of challan goes to show that concerned doctor issued the ruqa on 14.09.2014 i.e. a date prior to the alleged accident and the same was collected by the police on 26.09.2014.This discrepancy creates a suspicion in the claim of the claimants. It is pertinent to mention here that claimants got examined Tilak Raj, Senior Supervisor of DMC Hospital, who deposed that Anil Kumar Ghai was admitted in the DMC Hospital on 20.09.2014 and discharged on 27.09.2014 and he proved the bills EX CW 3/1 to Ex CW3/12 regarding the admission of Anil Kumar Ghai in the Hospital. However he has not produced the MLR of the Anil Kumar Ghai which can suggest that he received the injuries on 20.09.2014. There is no evidence which could clear the air how the medical ruqa was issued from the date prior to the the date of alleged accident. 18. The Post Mortem Report ( part of challan EX R3/A) depicts that Anil Kumar Ghai died on 27.09.2014 at 4.07 as per hospital record. The doctor has opined that cause of death in this case is due to septicemia 10 shock which is sufficient to cause death in an ordinary course of nature. The onus was on the complainant to prove that septicemia was developed due to the injuries sustained in a road side accident. Claimants have not produced the record of the MLR and treatment chart of the deceased which can show that septicemia developed in the body of deceased due the injuries sustained in the alleged road side accident. 19. As per the evidence of CW-2 Arun Kumar Ghai, after the accident on 20.09.2014, the driver of Verna car bearing no. PB-27C-7777 fled away from the spot along with the car. FIR was lodged on the statement of Arun Kumar Ghai and police visited the occurrence on the same day I.e 27.09.2014. Surprisingly police got recovered the alleged offending car PB-27 C-7777 and scooter of deceased from the spot after the gap of seven days. There is no explanation how the vehicle bearing no. PB-27C-7777 found on the spot when CW2 has stated that driver of the aforesaid car fled away from the spot along with his vehicle. I have gone through the recovery memo dated 27.09.2014 ( part of the challan EX R3/A) vide which both the vehicles were taken into possession at spot. The recovery memo finds mention the name of the accused as Gurinder Singh @ Guri. At the time of the alleged recovery of the offending vehicle at the spot, there was no clue or reason with the investigating officer of the case to come at the conclusion that Gurinder Singh was the accused in the aforesaid criminal case. It is beyond comprehension how investigating officer got recorded the name of the accused on the recovery memo. The collusion between the claimants and the respondents no.1 and 2 is evident from the fact that Gurinder Singh 11 had also lodged an FIR no.121 dated 24.9.2014 with P.S.Sudhar Ludhiana for the theft of the alleged offending car on 20.9.2014. It appears the purpose of the whole exercise is to secure compensation in the present claim petition and thereafter to earn acquittal in the criminal trial. 20. Learned counsel for the claimants have argued the delay in lodging the FIR is not ground to reject the claim of the claimants. He further argued that CW 2 Arun Kumar Ghai has deposed that he kept contacting the police official from 20.09.2014 till his statement was recorded on phone. Learned counsel further submitted that accident cannot be doubted merely on ground of delay in lodging FIR. 21. There is no doubt that mere delay in lodging the FIR is not a ground for rejecting the claim of the claimants, but claimants are bound to prove the accident, identity of vehicle and its driver involved in the accident. However, in the present case the claimants have failed to prove the accident, identity of vehicle and its driver due to the aforesaid discussion. 22.Therefore, this court has no hesitation to hold that claimants have failed to prove that deceased suffered accidental injuries on 20.09.2014. The claimants have failed to adduce any cogent and convincing evidence to prove the involvement of alleged vehicle. After considering the entire conspectus of the material placed on the file I am of the considered view that claimants have failed to prove that Anil Kumar Ghai died due to the accidental injuries due to the accident with Verna Car bearing no.PB-27C-7777. Accordingly, issue No.1 is decided against the claimants and in favour of respondents. 12 Issues No.2 and 3: - 23.Onus to prove issue no.2 was upon the claimants and issue no.3 was upon the respondents. In view of the findings recorded under issue no.1, these issue have become redundant. Relief 24.As a result of my discussion above, the present claim petition filed by the claimants is hereby dismissed with costs. Memo of cost be prepared. Pleader fee is assessed at Rs. 1000/-. File be consigned to the Record Room. Pronounced in open Court DINESH KUMAR 27.04.2016 Motor Accident Claims Tribunal Ludhiana"

Rajiv Abhi, Advocate for respondent No. 3. AWARD 1.The present claim petition has been filed by the claimant for the grant of compensation to the tune of Rs.10,00,000/- on account of multiple grievous injuries received by her due to road side accident. (2) MACP-136/2015 Kamla Thapar Vs. Manoj Kumar & Ors. 2.The brief facts as averred in the claim petition are that on 17.6.2014 the claimant along with her husband Subhash Chander Thapar were coming from Bazar by purchasing medicines as they have to go to England to their house. Stevon Thapar son of the claimant was to take the claimant and her husband but he got late. Thus, the claimant and her husband boarded three wheeler bearing No. PB-10-DS-6887. At about 3.00 PM, when three wheeler reached at the cut of Kali Sarak, Main G.T. Road, Ludhiana, then from the side of Kali Sarak, a Bolero Mohindra bearing registration No. PB-10-DV-5110 came, which was driven by respondent No. 1 rashly and negligently on very high speed without blowing any horn and without due care and caution and struck with the three wheeler on its back side, with the result claimant and her husband fell on the road and received multiple grievous injuries on different parts of the body. At that time, the son of the claimant along with his friend Arash Kohli were coming in his car and they also witnessed the occurrence, who immediately taken the claimant and her husband to DMC Hospital, Ludhiana. This accident took place on account of rash and negligent act/ driving of respondent No. 1 while driving the Bolero Mohindra bearing registration No. PB-10-DV-5110. As such, the claimant is entitled to compensation and an award for a sum of Rs. 10 Lacs along with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of accident till realization be passed in favour of the claimant and against the respondents jointly and severally. 3.Upon notice, all the respondents appeared through their respective counsels and contested the present claim petition by filing their (3) MACP-136/2015 Kamla Thapar Vs. Manoj Kumar & Ors. separate replies. In their written reply, the respondents No. 1 and 2 have taken preliminary objections that the claim petition is totally false and frivolous. The claimant has no right to claim any kind of compensation from the answering respondents as the accident was not taken place due to negligence of the respondent No. 1. The respondent No. 1 was driving his vehicle on a normal speed with due care and diligence. The vehicle of answering respondents was duly insured with the respondent No. 3 and the answering respondent No. 1 was holding a legal and valid driving license at the time of alleged accident. As such, the respondents No. 1 and 2 are not liable to pay the claim amount to the claimant. On merits, it has been pleaded that false FIR has been got registered by husband of the claimant against the answering respondents with a view to extract money by illegal means. No such injuries as alleged were ever occurred to the claimant. The claimant has concocted a false story just to extract money under the garb of present petition. Rest of the averments are denied in general, with prayer for dismissal of the present petition. 4.In its written statement, the respondent No. 3 has taken preliminary objections that present claim petition is not maintainable since no accident has ever taken place in the manner as stated in the claim petition. The present claim petition is bad for non-joinder of necessary parties since all the legal heirs of injured and the owner, driver and insurance company of three wheeler No. PB-10-DS-6887 are not impleaded as party to the present claim petition. The answering respondent No. 3 is not responsible for any compensation as respondent No. 1 Manoj Kumar driver of Bolero No. PB-10-DV-5110 did not hold (4) MACP-136/2015 Kamla Thapar Vs. Manoj Kumar & Ors. valid and effective driving license on the date of alleged accident. As such, the respondent No. 2 has committed willful default and breach in terms and conditions of insurance policy by handing over the vehicle in question to the respondent No. 1 knowing fully well that he did not possess and hold a valid and effective driving license. Bolero No. PB-10- DV-5110 did not have the valid registration certificate and fitness certificate at the time of alleged accident and was being driven against the provisions of Motor Vehicle Act. On merits, it has been pleaded that Bolero Mohindra bearing No. PB-10-DV-5110 is not involved in the alleged accident. It is admitted that Bolero Mohindra bearing registration No. PB-10-DV-5110 is insured with respondent No. 3. It is denied that in the alleged accident, the claimant and her husband received multiple grievous injuries. The claimant is not entitled to any compensation as alleged in the petition. Rest of the averments are denied in general, with prayer for dismissal of the present petition. 5.From the pleadings of the parties following issues were framed:- 1) Whether claimant received injuries in a motor vehicle accident which took place on 17.6.2014 due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle i.e. Bolero Mohindra bearing No. PB-10-DV-5110, which was being driven by respondent No. 1, owned by respondent No.2 and insured with respondent No. 3? If so, its effect? OPP 2) If issue No. 1 is proved, whether the claimant is entitled to compensation as alleged? If so, to what extent and from which of the respondent? OPP 3) Whether the claim petition is maintainable in the present form? OPP 4) Whether the respondent No. 1 was not having valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident? OPR3 (5) MACP-136/2015 Kamla Thapar Vs. Manoj Kumar & Ors. 5) Whether offending vehicle i.e. Bolero No. PB-10-DV-5110 did not having valid registration certificate and fitness certificate at the time of alleged accident? OPR3 6) Whether the present claim petition is bad for nonjoinder of the necessary parties? OPR3 7) Relief. 6.In order to prove his case, the claimant Kamla Thapar herself stepped into witness box as CW1 and examined Stevan Thapar as CW2 and thereafter learned counsel for the claimant closed evidence of the claimant in affirmative after proving on record documents relied upon by her. In documentary evidence, the claimant has placed on record documents i.e. certified copy of FIR Ex.P1, patient admission in hospitalization Ex.P2, certified copy of discharge certificates Ex.P3 and Ex.P4, hospitalization and medical bills Ex.P5 to Ex.P65, copy of PAN card Ex.P66, copy of Income Tax Return Ex.P67 and copy of Visa Ex.P68. 7.To rebut evidence of the claimant, the respondents No. 1 and 2 tendered into evidence documents i.e. copy of Insurance Policy Ex.R1, copy of Registration Certificate of vehicle No. PB-10-DV-5110 Ex.R2 and copy of driving license as Ex.R3 and closed their evidence. Learned counsel for the respondent No. 3 tendered in evidence Insurance Policy Ex.R1 and closed evidence of the respondent No. 3. No witness has been examined by rebuttal by the claimant. 8.I have heard learned counsel for the parties and with their able assistance have gone through the documents and evidence placed on (6) MACP-136/2015 Kamla Thapar Vs. Manoj Kumar & Ors. record by them very carefully and minutely. My issue-wise findings are as under:- ISSUES NO. 1 & 2 9.Both these issues are being taken up together for the purpose of convenience being inter connected and in order to avoid repetition. The onus to prove both these issues was placed upon the claimant and in order to prove these issues, the claimant Kamla Thapar herself appeared in the witness box as CW1 and she deposed by way of affidavit Ex.PA and reiterated the facts contained in claim petition. She has testified that on 17.6.2014, she along with her husband were coming from Bazar after purchasing medicines as they had to go to their house in England. Stevan Thapar was to take them but he got late. So, she along with her husband boarded a three wheeler No. PB-10- DS-6887. At about 3.00 PM, when the three wheeler reached the cut of Kali Sadak, Main G.T. Road, Ludhiana, then from the side of Kali Sadak, a Bolero Mohindra bearing registration No. PB-10-DV-5110 came, which was being driven by respondent No. 1 at a very high speed without blowing any horn in a rash and negligent manner and without due care and caution struck the three wheeler from the backside as a result of which she and her husband fell on the road and received multiple grievous injuries on various parts of their body. At that time, her son along with his friend Arsh Kohli were coming in a car and they also witnessed the whole accident. He took them to DMC Hospital, Ludhiana. The accident took place on account of rash and negligent driving of respondent No. 1 while driving the Bolero Mohindra bearing registration No. PB-10-DV-5110. The police registered (7) MACP-136/2015 Kamla Thapar Vs. Manoj Kumar & Ors. the FIR No. 170 dated 19.6.2014 under Section 279, 337, 338 IPC at Police Station Basti Jodhewal, Ludhiana against the respondent No. 1 on the statement of her husband. She further testified that she was admitted in DMC Hospital on 17.6.2014 and discharged on 19.6.2014 and is still under the treatment as an outdoor patient of the said hospital. She enjoyed very good health before the accident and after she met with the accident, she started remaining sick. Her family was fully dependent upon her earnings. Her right hand has been fractured and left side of her forehead was badly injured. Thereafter, an operation was conducted and she got multiple injuries in her body. Due to the injuries received by her, the physiotherapy is being regularly conducted due to the internal injuries sustained by her in the accident. She remained bed ridden for five months and during the said period, her business has been ruined. She is unable to perform the daily pursuits of life and is unable to continue her business. She and her husband got the visa on 11.6.2014 to go to England to meet her daughter and they have to fly on 20.6.2014. They had to spend a huge amount to take the visa and completing formalities. Due to the injuries suffered in the accident, they could not go to England. She has suffered mental and physical pain and agony on account of injuries sustained by her in the accident. She shall have to depend upon others for her remaining life. She is having very good reputation in the society. She has professional experience of Boutique and dealing with said business for last 15 years. Her family status is high and she lead a lavish life and often visits foreign countries. She has her own house, mobile and other luxury items. She had to again undergo tremendous hardships, pain, agony and (8) MACP-136/2015 Kamla Thapar Vs. Manoj Kumar & Ors. unwearable inconvenience and multiple injuries. She employed a Nurse at a monthly expenditure of Rs.5000/-. She has spent huge amount on special diet as a advised by the doctor. She has been getting regular treatment from DMC Hospital and various other private hospitals in Ludhiana and is incurring Rs.3000/- per month on medicines and traveling expenses. She placed and proved on record certified copy of the FIR as Ex.P1, patient admission in hospitalization Ex.P2, certified copy of discharge certificates Ex.P3 and Ex.P4, hospitalization and medical bills Ex.P5 to Ex.P65, copy of PAN card Ex.P66, copy of Income Tax Return Ex.P67 and copy of Visa Ex.P68. The claimant has also examined her son Stevan Thapar, eyewitness, who has appeared as CW2 and testified on affidavit Ex.CW-2, who has corroborated the statement made by CW1 Kamla Thapar regarding the factum of accident. He has testified that on 17.6.2014, his father and mother were coming from Bazar after purchasing medicines as they have to go to England to their house. He was to take his parents but he got late and so his parents boarded a three wheeler bearing No. PB-10-DS-6887. At that time, he along with his friend Arsh Kohli were coming in a car behind the auto rickshaw. Rest he testified as per statement made by CW1 Kamla Thapar. 10.On the other hand, the respondents No. 1 and 2, who are the driver and the owner of the offending vehicle preferred not to appear in the witness box and respondents No. 1 to 3 have only proved on record the documents relied upon by them. 11.The respondent no. 1 alleged driver of Bolero Mohindra bearing registration No. PB-10-DV-5110 though has preferred to contest (9) MACP-136/2015 Kamla Thapar Vs. Manoj Kumar & Ors. the petition and filed the written statement has failed to step into the witness box. His contention in the written statement is that the accident has not taken place due to his negligence and he was driving his vehicle on a normal speed with due care and diligence by holding a valid driving license and so, he cannot be held liable. It is a settled principle of law that if the driver does not come into the witness box to depose regarding the accident, then adverse inference can be drawn against him. Our own Hon'ble High Court in case titled as Bhagwani Devi Vs. Krishan Kumar Saini and others, reported in 1986 Accident Claim Journal at page 331 has held as under:- “The cause of accident can best be explained by the drivers concerned and if they are kept away from the witness box without any sound reasons, it must indeed be construed as telling circumstance against the respondents”. Similar view has been taken by our Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in case titled as Raju and others Vs. Sukhwinder Singh and others, reported in 2006 (4) RCR (Civil) at page 82 that:- “Negligence of the driver- Adverse inference- If the driver of the offending vehicle does not come forward to deny his negligence, then adverse inference is to be drawn in favour of the claimants and the driver is presumed to be negligent”. 12.So, I find that the respondents No. 1 and 2 have failed to rebut the evidence lead by the claimant and respondents No. 1 and 2 did not bother to appear in the court as witnesses to prove the fact that the accident had not taken place due to rash and negligent driving of (10) MACP-136/2015 Kamla Thapar Vs. Manoj Kumar & Ors. respondent No. 1. Though, they have denied the negligence on the part of respondent No. 1 in driving the vehicle but non appearance of the driver in the witness box to depose regarding accident clearly shows that he has impliedly admitted the accident as alleged by the claimant. So, from the evidence lead by the claimant, I have found that it is established on record that respondent No. 1 Manoj Kumar drove his Bolero Mohindra vehicle bearing No. PB-10-DV-5110 in a rash and negligent manner and struck the same with an auto rickshaw bearing No. PB-10-DS-6887 in which the claimant and his wife were traveling as passengers. On account of the impact, the claimant and her husband fell out of the auto rickshaw and received multiple and grievous injuries on the vital parts of their body. Moreover, FIR Ex.P1 bearing No. 170 dated 19.06.2014 was also registered against the respondent No. 1 driver in PS Jodhewal, Ludhiana on account of his rash and negligent driving and thereby causing simple and grievous injuries on the person of claimant Kamla Thapar and her husband Subhash Chander Thapar on the road. So, it is held that the accident took place on account of rash and negligent driving of the driver of vehicle No. PB-10-DV-5110, who has been arrayed as respondent No. 1. In these circumstances of the case, I find that there is no dispute with regard to the accident and claimant has deposed that respondent No. 2 was the owner of said Bolero Mohindra vehicle and respondent No. 1 while driving the same struck it with auto rickshaw bearing No. PB-10-DS- 6887 in which the claimant and her husband were traveling as passengers. So, in view of my above discussion, reasons and findings, it is held that claimant and her husband received grievous injuries on their body in a (11) MACP-136/2015 Kamla Thapar Vs. Manoj Kumar & Ors. road side accident on 17.6.2014 due to rash and negligent driving of the driver Manoj Kumar while driving Mohindra Bolero bearing No. PB-10- DV-5110, which was owned by respondent No. 2 Brijesh Kumar Jain. Accordingly, issue No. 1 is decided in favour of the claimant and against the respondents No. 1 and 2. 13.The present claim has been filed by the petitioner due to the accidental injuries received by her for compensation of Rs.10 Lacs. To prove issue no. 2 claimant has herself appeared in the witness box as CW1 and testified that on account of injuries received by her in the roadside accident, she was admitted in DMC Hospital on 17.6.2014 and discharged on 19.06.2014. She is still under treatment as outdoor patient. She also has spent on her medical treatment, special diet, attendants, conveyance charges. Due to the accidental injuries suffered by her in the motor vehicle accident caused by the respondent No. 1 while driving Mohindra Bolero No. PB-10-DV-5110. Sh e is still under treatment. She was having good health at the time of accident and her family was dependent on her. She is unable to follow the ordinary pursuits of life on her own and rather is dependent on employed attendant for all the times at a monthly expenses of Rs.5,000/-. She has spent huge amount on special diet advised by the doctor, which is still continuing. She suffered lot of pain, agony, sufferings, due to the injuries suffered by her in the accident. She has also suffered financial loss and she is unable to do her business since the date of accident. She proved on record the medical documents as Ex.P2 to Ex.P4 and medical bills from Ex.P5 to Ex.P65. The claimant also examined Stevan Thapar as CW2, who has also testified as per CW1 (12) MACP-136/2015 Kamla Thapar Vs. Manoj Kumar & Ors. regarding the injuries suffered by her in the accident and the medical expenses spent by him on her treatment. On the other hand, no evidence whatsoever has been lead by the respondents No. 1 to 3 and counsel appearing on behalf of these respondents have in the cross-examination of both these witnesses tried to prove on record that the documents placed on the file are incorrect and the medical bills have been wrongly placed. 14.A close perusal of the above evidence that has come on record on behalf of the parties on this issue shows that the claimant has successfully proved that the accident is caused due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent No. 1 resulting in serious injuries and soft tissue injury first web space right hand lacerated wound and for which debridgement and suturing of wound were done. In all the claimant has proved that she has spent an amount of Rs. 64,000/-. Her treatment is still continuing and therefore an amount of Rs.20,000/- can be added as future medical expenses. So, in my view, the claimant is entitled to get Rs.80,000/- as her incurred medical expenses and future medical expenses. The claimant remain in pain and suffering for a period of about 3 months on account of the injuries received by her in the accident and therefore, in my view, she is entitled to Rs.50,000/- on this ground. She is also entitled for loss of amenities of life and she is entitled for Rs.50,000/- on this aspect. The claimant is also entitled for conveyance allowance as she had to go to attend the hospital and the doctor and she is entitled for Rs.25,000/- on this aspect of the case. During the period of her treatment, the claimant was required to take special diet and in my view, she is entitled to Rs.25,000/- as expenses on special diet. The claimant also had (13) MACP-136/2015 Kamla Thapar Vs. Manoj Kumar & Ors. to engage an attendant and she paid Rs.5,000/- per month to her and in my view, she is entitled to get the attendant charges at the rate of Rs.5000/- per month for a period of 3 months and therefore she is entitled to Rs.15,000/- as attendant charges. Since the claimant was working and was having her own Boutique and was an income tax assessee and in this regard she has proved on record the income tax return for the assessment year 2015-16 as Ex.P67 along with her PAN card as Ex.P66, so, she is entitled for the loss of income. As per the income tax return for the assessment year 2015-16, her gross income was Rs.2.80 Lacs (approximately) and therefore, her monthly income can be calculated as Rs.23,000/- (approximately) and she is entitled for loss of income for one month of Rs.21,000/- by deducting Rs.2,000/- as tax and other ancillary expenses. Reliance in this regard can be placed on the law laid down by our Hon'ble High Court in Naresh Kumar Vs. Kartar Singh and others, reported in 2014 (2) Law Herald, at page 1568 , wherein it has been held as under:- “Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, Section 166- Motor accident- Personal injury- Pecuniary loss- Claim for factors to be considered under said head:- (i) age; (ii) employment/avocation and income; (iii) period of hospitalization and details such as (a)cost of medicines; (b) hospitalization charges; including consultation charges, room rent, etc; (c) attendant charges; (d) special diet and (e) expenses for future hospitalization and treatment, including physiotherapy; (iv) nature of injuries; such as abrasions, cut injuries, crush injuries, fractures; (v) loss of income during the period of treatment and (vi) transportation.” (14) MACP-136/2015 Kamla Thapar Vs. Manoj Kumar & Ors. So, in all, in my view the claimant is entitled to a total compensation of Rs. 2.70 Lacs. 15.Now the question arises as to from which of the respondents, the claimant is entitled to get the compensation. In the present case, vehicle No. PB-10-DV-5110 was owned by Brijesh Kumar Jain, respondent No. 2 on the date of accident on 17.6.2014. The accident took place on 17.6.2014 at 3.00 PM and the vehicle No. PB-10-DB-5110 was duly insured with the Universal Sampo General Insurance Company Limited in the name of respondent No. 2 Brijesh Kumar Jain vide policy No. 2311/53458793/00/000 valid from 3.9.2013 to 2.9.2014 covering the date of accident. The said insurance policy is on record as Ex.R1. Accordingly, since the vehicle involved in the accident was registered in the name of Brijesh Kumar Jain respondent No. 2 on the date of accident and the same was insured with respondent No. 3 Insurance Company, so, it is the responsibility of respondent No. 2 to pay the compensation amount to the claimant. The driving license of the driver Manoj Kumar has been proved on record as Ex.R3, which was valid on the date of accident for driving LMV non transport vehicle and therefore, it is clear that respondent No. 1 was having a valid driving license to drive the vehicle involved in the accident. Since, the vehicle No. PB-10-DB-5110 owned by respondent No. 2 Brijesh Kumar Jain was duly insured by respondent No. 3 Insurance Company, so the Insurance Company is liable to indemnify the respondent No. 2 and to pay the claim to the claimant. Accordingly, in view of my above discussion and reasons, issue no. 2 is decided in favour of the claimant and against respondents no.1 to 3. (15) MACP-136/2015 Kamla Thapar Vs. Manoj Kumar & Ors. ISSUE NO.3 16.The onus to prove this issue was placed upon the claimant. In view of my findings on issues no.1 and 2 above, it is held that the claim petition as filed by the claimant for compensation is maintainable in its present form. Hence issue no.3 is decided in favour of the claimant and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.4 17.The onus to prove this issue was placed upon the respondent no.3. However, no argument on this issue has been addressed by any of the parties. So, Insurance Company has failed to prove on record that the respondent No. 1 was not having any valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident. So, it is held that the respondent No. 1 was having a valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident. Hence, issue No. 4 is decided in favour of respondent No. 1 and against respondent No. 3. ISSUE NO.5 18.The onus to prove this issue was placed upon the respondent No. 3. No arguments on this issue have been addressed by respondent No. 3. So, the respondent No. 4 has failed to prove on record that the offending vehicle was not having valid registration certificate and fitness certificate at the time of accident. Even otherwise, the Registration Certificate of the vehicle No. PB-10-DV-5110 is proved on record as Ex.R2 and the same was a private vehicle. Hence this issue No. 5 is decided in favour of respondent No. 2 and against respondent No. 3. (16) MACP-136/2015 Kamla Thapar Vs. Manoj Kumar & Ors. ISSUE NO.6 19.The onus to prove this issue was placed upon the respondent No. 3. However, no arguments on this issue were addressed by the learned counsel for the parties. In view of my findings on issues no.1 and 2 above, it is held that the claim petition as filed by the claimant for compensation is not bad for non joinder and misjoinder of any necessary parties. Hence issue no.6 is decided against the respondents and in favour of the claimant. RELIEF 20.In view of my above discussion, reasons and findings especially on issues No.1 and 2 above, the claim petition filed by the claimant is accepted, with costs. The respondent no.1 and 2 being driver and registered owner of the offending vehicle, whose liability is joint and several, are directed to pay Rs.2.70 Lacs as total compensation along with interest @ 6% p.a. from the date of filing of petition till the date of actual payment to the claimant as compensation within three months from the date of award failing which the claimant is entitled to recover the compensation amount along with interest @ 7.5 % per annum as mentioned above through the competent court of law. At the time of accident, vehicle No. PB-10-DV-5110 was duly insured with respondent No. 3 vide policy No. 2311/53458793/00/000 valid from 3.9.2013 to 2.9.2014, which is proved on record as Ex.R1, so, the respondent No. 3 Insurance Company is liable and is directed to pay Rs.2.70 Lacs as total compensation along with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the date of actual payment to the claimant (17) MACP-136/2015 Kamla Thapar Vs.

Counsel for the claimants tendered copy of FIR EX C8 and attested copy of post mortem report EX C9 and copy of Aadhar card of Sanjay and closed the evidence. 8- On the other hand, no evidence has been led by the respondent No.1 and the evidence of respondent No.1 was closed by order. The Ld. Counsel for the respondent No.2 after tendering copy of insurance policy EX R1 closed the evidence on behalf of respondent No.2 9-I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have also examined the record of the case. My issue-wise findings are as under:- ISSUE NO.1 : 10-Onus to prove this issue was on the claimants and in order to discharge the onus, the claimants examined CW3 Deepak Basil,eye witness of the accident. This witness deposed that on 19.5.2015 at about 10/10-15 PM,he was present at the spot and deceased Sanjay was coming from Kohara side and when he was crossing the road near Kohara Machhiwara Road, at that time, one Truck bearing No. PB-05-V 9975 came from Machhiwara side rashly and negligently in a very speed without blowing horn and hit the deceased. Resultantly, the deceased came under the tyre of Truck bearing No. PB-05-V-9975 and received grievous injuries on his body and died at the spot. He deposed that the said truck was being driven by respondent No.1 Nirmal Singh rashly and negligently. He had also taken 4 photographs of spot and of the offending truck bearing No. PB-05-V 9975 from his mobile phone. CW1 Purnima who is widow of deceased and CW2 Mulhe Parsad who is father of deceased also deposed in their respective affidavits that deceased died in the motor vehicle accident caused by respondent No.1. The claimants also proved FIR EX C8 bearing No. 47 of 20.5.2015 which was registered against respondent No.1 also goes on to show that the deceased died in the motor vehicle accident on account of rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. The contention of Ld. Counsel for the Ld. Counsel for the respondents that it is case of contributory negligence of both the drivers of trucks as there was head on collision and even FIR was registered against both the drivers, but there is no evidence led by the respondents No.1 and 2 to show that the death was not occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. More over, the respondent No.1 did not step into witness box to rebut the version of claimants that deceased was not died in the road side accident, caused by him, while driving Truck No. PB-05V-9975. In these circumstances, the driver i.e. the respondent no.1 of the offending vehicle was the most material witness to depose about this fact but he did not dare to step into the witness box for the reasons best known to him. As such, it is clear that on this ground alone, an adverse inference can be drawn against him as settled in Bhagwanti Devi Vs. Krishan Kumar Saini and others 1986 A.C.J.331 and Laxmi and Company Vs. Savitri Devi Aggarwal and others 1990 A.C.J. 450. 11- In view of the above discussed oral as well as documentary evidence, adduced on record by the claimants including post mortem report 5 placed on file, which also suggest that the deceased died due to receipt of multiple injuries in motor vehicle accident and factual position that the respondent No.1 did not appear to depose on oath, it has been fully proved on the record that on 19.5.2015, the accident took place, due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1 by driving his Truck No. PB-05V- 9975 in which, the deceased Sanjay suffered multiple grievous injuries and later on succumbed to his injuries. Accordingly, Issue no.1 is decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondents ISSUE NO.2: 12-Onus to prove this issue was on the claimants. In order to prove this issue, claimant Purnima who is widow of deceased Sanjay,stepped into witness box as CW1 and categorically deposed that the deceased was 25 years old at the time of accidential death. He was able bodied person and was doing the work of loading and unloading of scrap. He used to take contracts in the factories for loading and unloading of scrap materials and he was earning Rs. 20,000/- per month. The claimants No.1 and 2 have no source of income of their own. They were fully dependent on the income of the deceased. However, during cross examination, she conceded that she has not placed on record any document or any other evidence to prove the income of deceased. The claimants No.3 to 5 are married and living separately. They have their own independent earning for their own families. So,it is held that the claimants No.3 to 5 are not entitled to any compensation. The claimants also examined Mulhe Parsad,as CW2 who is father of deceased Sanjay. He also deposed that his son was doing the work of loading and unloading of scrap. He also stated that he has not 6 placed on record any document or any other evidence to show the income of deceased Sanjay. He also stated that deceased Sanjay studied upto 4-5th standard. So, in the absence of any documentary evidence with regard to income of deceased, it cannot be presumed or assumed that deceased was earning Rs.20,000/- per month. Since it has been categorically stated by both CW1 and CW2 that the deceased was doing the work of loading and unloading scrap and as such, he can be kept in the bracket of labourer and as such, notional income of deceased Sanjay can be assessed at Rs. 6000/- per month. As such the income of deceased Sanjay is assessed at Rs. 6,000/- and in this manner, the annual income of the deceased comes out to be Rs.72,000/- and as per law ,the deduction of 1/3th as personal living expenses where number of dependent family members are 2 to 3 is required to be taken, as in the case in hand, both the claimants admitted that claimants No.3 to 5 have their own earning and families and as such,for the purpose of deduction, they cannot be considered and as such, after deduction of 1/3th the income of the deceased being assessed at Rs.48,000/ per annum. Both CW1 and CW2 in their respective affidavits stated that the deceased was of 25 years of age at the time of time and even in post mortem report, age of deceased is mentioned as 25 years. In these circumstances, it is held that the deceased was 25 years at the time of accident. So as per law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled Smt. Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Anr. Reported in 2009(3) RCR (Civil) 77, the multiplier applied would be 18 the amount of compensation as such comes to Rs. 8,64,000/-. The claimants are also entitled to compensation of Rs.25,000/- as funeral 7 charges. Learned counsel for the claimant also stressed for consortium and relied upon ratio of authority passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled Rajesh & others Vs. Rajbir Singh & Others reported in 2013(3) Civil Court Cases. Keeping in view the ratio of above said authority, the claimant No.1 is also entitled to consortium to the tune of Rs.1 lac ( Rs. 1,00,000/- ). This issue is decided accordingly in favour of the claimants and against the respondents ISSUE NO.3 : 13-The onus to prove this issue lies on the respondents. It is already held in issue No.1 the claimants No.1 and 2 being legal heirs of deceased Sanjay are entitled to compensation on account of death of Sanjay , who succumbed to the injuries on account of motor vehicle accident, caused by respondent No.1 by driving Truck bearing No. PB-05V-9975 in a rash and negligent manner on 19.5.2015 and as such, this claim petition is very much maintainable. Accordingly this issue is decided in favour of claimants and against the respondents. ISSUES NO.4 and 5: 14-The onus to prove these issue was upon the respondent No.2. But no evidence in this regard has been led by the respondent No.2 to show that the respondent No.1 was not holding a valid driving licence or that the offending vehicle was not having valid RC, fitness certificate and route permit. On the other hand, the respondent No.1 has placed on record photo copy of driving licence of respondent No.1, photo copy of RC and photo copy of permit and in the absence of any contrary evidence led by the respondent No.2, it is held that the at the time of accident, the 8 respondent No.1 was having valid driving licence and the offending vehicle was having valid insurance policy and other documents and as such, both these issues are decided in favour of respondent No.1 and against respondent No.2. RELIEF 15-In view of my above issue wise detailed discussion, instant claim petition is allowed, with costs to the effect that the claimants No.1 and 2 only are entitled to receive compensation of Rs. 8,89,000/- (Rs. Eight lac and Eighty nine thousands) in equal share and in addition to this,claimant No.1 is also entitled to receive consortium to the tune of Rs.1,00,000/-from the respondents jointly and severally.The claimants are also entitled to interest @ 7.5% per annum on the above said amount, from the date of filing of the claim petition till actual realization. The driver and owners i.e. respondent No.1 who is primarily responsible to pay this compensation, but since respondent no.2 being insurance company vide insurance policy Ex R1 has agreed to indemnify respondent no.1 against all third party claims, it is the respondent no.2 who shall meet the liability by making the payment. If the respondent No.2 fails to make the payment of the compensation within two months from the date of this order to claimant, then, they will be liable to pay the future interest at the rate of 9% per annum. Memo of costs be prepared. File be consigned to the record room. Announced in open Court Harjeet Singh, 10.03.2016 Motor Accident Claims Tribunal Ludhiana. 9"

They were travelling on a motorcycle bearing No.PB-29-E-6785 and Jarnail Singh his brother was accompanying them on his separate motorcycle. Gurcharan Singh was driving his motorcycle on the correct left side of the road at a moderate speed and Karnail Singh was pillion rider. Jarnail Singh was following the motorcycle of Gurcharan Singh at a distance of 20/25 yards in the same manner. It was at about 6 P.M., when they reached near the main gate of Gurudwara 6th Patshahi crossing, village Dhuddike, District Moga on Ajitwal to Maadoke Road. In the meantime, a Swift Car bearing No.PB-10-DY- 3313 of white colour came from the opposite side form the side of village Maddoke which was being driven at a high speed and the driver of the car without applying any horn or giving any signal, drove in a rash and negligent manner. The car leaving its correct side, came to extreme wrong side of the road and hit against the motorcycle of Gurcharan Singh. The front right side of the car struck against the front right side of the motorcycle.

The answering respondent is not liable for any compensation as is mentioned in the claim petition since respondent No.1 Shri Harjinder Singh alleged driver of Swift car No.PB10-DY-3313 did not hold valid and effective driving licence on the date of alleged accident.

In rebuttal evidence, Counsel for the claimants tendered the documents Mark-F to Mark-H and closed the evidence. Page: 8 Harnek Kaur vs. Harjinder Singh & Ors. MACT No.69 of 21.4.2015 10.I have heard the learned Counsel for the parties and have gone through the record with their able assistance. My issue-wise findings are as under: Issues No.1 and 2: 11.Being interconnected, these issues are taken up together for discussion. 12.Claimant Harnek Kaur herself has appeared as her own witness as CW1 and deposed by way of her Affidavit Ex.CA whereby she has reasserted and reiterated her entire pleaded case. Therefore, to avoid repetition and for the sake of brevity, the depositions appearing in her Affidavit may be omitted to be mentioned here again. 13.Jarnail Singh CW2 has deposed by way of his Affidavit Ex.CB that on 24.3.2015 he had gone to village Ajitwal on his motorcycle. In the evening, he had met his father Gurcharan Singh @ Charan Singh and his brother Karnail Singh @ Kaddu there and all of them started for their residence at village Maddoke. His father Gurcharan Singh started from Ajitwal by driving his motorcycle No.PB-29E-6785 on the correct left side of the road at a moderate speed while his brother Karnail Singh @ Kaddu was occupying pillion seat of the same. He started following them by a dinstance of about 15-20 yards on his separate motorcycle. At about 6 P.M., when the motorcycle of his father reached near the main Gate of Gurudwara 6th Patshahi after crossing village Dhudhike, Tehsil Ajitwal on Ajitwal to Maadoke Road, in the meantime, a Swift Car bearing No.PB-10-DY-3313 of white colour came from oppsoite side Page: 9 Harnek Kaur vs. Harjinder Singh & Ors. MACT No.69 of 21.4.2015 form village Maadoke side on a fast and uncontrolled speed without blowing any horn in a rash and negligent manner by its driver. Hy way of his Affidavit Ex.CB, he has unfolded the version of happening of accident. He deposed that Swift car was being driven by the respondent No.1 in a rash and negligent manner and hit against the motorcycle of his father and both of them thrown on the metaled road alongwith their bike and sustained serious multiple and grievous injuries. The driver of offending vehicle also came to the spot and disclosed his name as Harjinder Singh son of Surjit Singyh but later on fled away from the spot when he was busy in taking care of his father and brother,due to fear of gathering, by leaving his car there. Both the vicitms were brought to PHC , Chuhar Chak by him with the help of passerby in the vehicle arranged at the spot. After giving first aid, both were taken to the Civil Hospital, Moga. His father Gucharan Singh died on reaching there. His brother Karnail Singh @ Kaddu was further referred to Guru Gobind Singh Medical College, Faridkot for higher medical facilities but he also died on the way to the said hospital. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the truck by respondent No.1 who fled away from the spot. On his statement, the FIR was registered against the respondent No.1. 14.The learned Counsel for the claimants has contended that by examining the witnesses as mentioned here in above, the claimants have proved that the accident had taken place wherein deceased Karnail Singh @ Kaddu and Gurcharan Singh have lost their life due to rash and Page: 10 Harnek Kaur vs. Harjinder Singh & Ors. MACT No.69 of 21.4.2015 negligent driving of the offending vehicle by the respondent No.1. He being driver, respondent No.2 being owner and respondent No.3 being insurance company, are liable to pay the compensation amount jointly and severally. 15.The learned Counsel for the respondents No.1 and 2 has contended that no accident took place as alleged. However if it is established that accident took place, the respondents No.1 and 2 are not liable to pay any compensation because they are to be reimbursed by the respondent No.3 insurance company with whom the alleged offending vehicle is insured. 16.The learned Counsel for the respondent No.3 insurance company has contended that the accident has not been proved beyond doubt. The age and income of the deceased has also not been proved. Although by way of amendment, mother of deceased, Karnail Kaur has been impleaded as respondent No.3 but she is not entitled to any compensation because she filed a separate claim petition for the death of Gurcharan Singh for the same accident. The deceased was a daily labouerer and his income cannot be assessed more than Rs.4000/- per month. 17.The perusal of record would reveal that regarding the accident, FIR No.17 dated 25.3.2015 under Section 279, 427, 304-A of the IPC, has been recorded at P.S. Ajitwal, District Moga. Jarnail Singh, PW2 is the eye witness of the accident. He has narrated about the mode and manner of the accident. He has not been shaken during cross-examination regarding the happening of the accident because of rash and negligent driving of the offending car by it s dirver respondent No.1. The Page: 11 Harnek Kaur vs. Harjinder Singh & Ors. MACT No.69 of 21.4.2015 respondents No.1 and 2 have denied the accident but they have not come forward to appear in the Court as a witness and depose in support of their case. If a party to the proceedings does not appear in the witness box to state on the averments of it and to depose against the averments of the other party, the adverse inference could be drawn that what has been pleaded by the said party who has omitted to appear as a witness and has avoided the test of cross-examination to bring truth on record, is untrue. In the pronouncement “Sheela Devi and others Versus Jayati Parshad and others, II (1995) ACC 240” of the Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court, it has been held that the driver of the offending vehicle was not produced in the witness box. Had he produced, he would have been the best person to admit or deny the factum of accident and the manner in which it had taken place. The adverse inference against the party to the lis, who omitted to appear in the witness box and to pass the test of cross- examination, can be drawn that what the said party has pleaded, is not correct. 18.The copy of FIR has been brought on record as Ex.P1. It is in consonance with the depositions of Jarnail Singh PW2. The Post Moretem Report Ex.P2 further corroborate the fact of accident. Not only it, as per Mark-F, charge has been framed against Harjinder Singh by the Magistrate for the offence under Sections 279, 304-0A and 427 of the IPC. The challan was presented against Harjinder Singh, copy of final report under Section 173 Cr.P.C.is Mark-G. The offending vehicle was taken into possession by the police party vide memo copy of which is Page: 12 Harnek Kaur vs. Harjinder Singh & Ors. MACT No.69 of 21.4.2015 Mark-H on record. It is settled principle of law that where the FIR has been recorded and the driver of offending vehicle is facing trial for causing hurt/and death of the victim, it is prima facie proof for the purpose of Motor Accident Claim Petition that the said driver was driving the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. I draw support in this regard from the pronouncement Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh,2008(2) Recent Civil Report 774” of the Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court where it has been held that if the driver is being tried on account of rash and negligent driving in a criminal Court of law, it is prima facie safe to hold that the accident occurred on account of rash and negligent driving. 19.Thus as a result of my discussion made here in above, it is held that the accident took place due the rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle which was being driven rashly and negligently by the respondent No.1. In the said accident, Karnail Singh @ Kaddu died. So far as the question of amount of compensation and liability to pay the same is concerned, the learned Counsel for the claimant has relied upon copy of the membership card of deceased Karnail Singh @ Kaddu Mark-G in support of his contentions that he was a member of All I ndia Food And Allied Workers' Union Regd. Regarding the claimants being legal heir and dependent, copy of Birth Certificate of Gurpreet Singh Mark-B, and of Jaskaranpreet Kaur Mark-C have been placed on record besides placing on record a copy of Adhar Card Mark-B and Mark-F. Regarding the date of birth of deceased, copy of Fifth Standard Examination Result has been placed on record as per which his date of birth is 25 Mary 1981. The Page: 13 Harnek Kaur vs. Harjinder Singh & Ors. MACT No.69 of 21.4.2015 accident took place on 24.3.2015. In the post mortem report, the age of deceased is mentioned to be 32 years. The multiplier of 16 is applicable for this age group in this case. The deceased was a “Palledar” worker. His notional minimum income is thus held to be Rs.6600/- per month. 1/3rd of his income is to be deducted for the purpose of assessing compensation towards his personal living and expenses etc. The income of the deceased per annum is thus taken to be Rs.4400/- per month i.e. Rs.52,800/- per annum. By applying the multiplier of 16, it comes to ₹ 8,44,800/-(Eight lacs Forty Four Thousand and Eight Hundred only). 20.The accident took place within the validity period of insurance as the offending vehicle was insured with the respondent No.3, copy of the insurance policy is Ex.R1. The particulars of the vehicle were sought to be verified by the Detective Company copy of which is Ex.R3. The Driving Licence of Harjinder Singh has been found to be genuine and correct as Ex.R5. The insurance company is thus liable to reimburse the compensation if so paid by the respondents No.1 and 2. Therefore, the liability of the respondents to pay the compensation amount to be assessed here in after is joint and several. 21.Resultantly, it is held that the claimant No.3 Karnail Kaur has filed a separate claim petition regarding death of her husband Gurcharan Singh @ Charan Singh occurred in the same accident. She thus cannot claim herself to be the dependent of both her husband and her son. Therefore, she is not entitled to the compensation in this case. It is further held that claimant No.1 Harnek Kaur, Claimant No.2 Gurpreet Singh , claimant Page: 14 Harnek Kaur vs. Harjinder Singh & Ors. MACT No.69 of 21.4.2015 No.2-A Jaskaranjeet Kaur are entitled to the compensation of 8,44,800/-₹ (Eight lacs Forty Four Thousand and Eight Hundred only) in equal shares. Harnek Kaur is also entitled to the amount of Rs.1,00,000/- (one lac) towards loss of consortium and 30,000/- towards transportation and ₹ funeral expenses. The respondents No.1, 2 and 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the said compensation amount. The amount of the share of minors from the compensation amount of 8,44,800/-(Eight lacs Forty₹ Four Thousand and Eight Hundred only) shall be deposited in some Government Bank in the shape of FDR. The minors shall be entitled to receive the maturity amount of the FDR on attaining their age of majority without seeking orders in this behalf from the MACT. However, if need be for the welfare of the minors, claimant No.1 Harnek Kaur shall be entitled to withdraw the annual interest earned from the FDR. The amount of compensation regarding loss of consortium and transportation and funeral expenses to which Harnek Kaur has been held entitled, is to be paid to her by the respondents jointly and severally. Both these issues are thus decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. Issue No.3: 22.The onus of this issues was on the respondents. In view of the findings returned on the issues No.1 and 2, the Court is of the opinion that the claim petition filed by the claimants being legal heirs of deceased Karnail Singh @ Kaddu seeking compensation on account of death of Karnail Singh @ Kaddu in a motor vehicle accident is duly maintainable in the present form but the respondents have failed to prove as to how the Page: 15 Harnek Kaur vs. Harjinder Singh & Ors.

Sh.Harwinder Pal Singh,Adv.for respondents No.1 & 2. Sh.R.K.Chand,Adv for respondent No.3. A W A R D 1.The claimants namely Santosh Kumari being the widow of -2- late Ram Lal, Rajinder Kumar being the son of late Ram Lal have filed this claim-petition under section 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act for grant of compensation to the tune of Rs.25,00,000/- on account of the death Ram Lal in a motor vehicular accident, which took place on 27.07.2012 at about 8.30 p.m. in the area of Urna Mour, Urna. 2. The brief facts of the case are that on 27.7.2012, the deceased along-with Subash Sharma was coming from Morinda towards Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar on Wagnor car bearing registration No.PB- 32-G-2945 which was being driven by Subash Sharma and Ram Lal was sitting on the front seat. When they reached near Urna Mour, Urna,, then the offending truck bearing registration No.HR-63-A-4481 being driven by respondent No.1 Parveen Kumar in a rash and negligent manner came from Machhiwara side and struck against the car of Subash Sharma. Due to the impact, the deceased and Subash Sharma received multiple injures on their person. The deceased was taken to civil Hospital Ludhiana and due to the serious injuries, he was referred to DMC Hospital, Ludhiana, where he remained under deep coma and on ventilator and succumbed to his injuries on 14.8.2012. An amount of Rs.6 lacs is alleged to have been spent on his treatment. In this regard, FIR no.94 dt.28.7.2012 under sections 279/337/338/427/304-A IPC was registered at Police Station Machhiwara against respondent No.1. -3- It has been pleaded by the claimants that the accident has taken place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent no.1. All the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the tune of Rs.25,00,000/- along-with interest at the rate of 24 % per annum. 3. Notice of the claim-petition was issued to the respondents. Respondent no.1 and 2 appeared through counsel. Since respondent No.1 failed to file any written statement despite grant of last-opportunity and non-payment of costs of adjournment, he was precluded from filing the written statement by my Ld.Predecessor vide order dt.2.4.2016. Respondent No.2 filed written statement raising preliminary objections that the claim petition is not maintainable in the present form and is liable to be dismissed on this short score; that the claimants have not come to the court with clean hands and have suppressed the material facts from the court as no accident as alleged has ever taken place; that the claimants have no cause of action to file the present claim-petition; that preset petition is bad for mis-joinnder and non-joinnder of necessary parties inasmuch as neither the Insurance Company of Wagnor car bearing registration No.PB-32-G-2945 nor the owner of said vehicle was made party and hence the petition deserved to be dismissed. On merits, it is stated that although the answering respondent has not violated any terms and conditions of the policy as at the time of -4- engaging the respondent no.1 as a driver. The answering respondent has duly checked the driving license of respondent No.1. The petition has been admitted to the extent qua registration number of the offending vehicle as HR-63-A-4481. It is denied that the alleged accident took place due to the rash, negligent and careless driving of respondent No.1. it is also denied that all the respondents being the driver, own and insurer of the offending vehicle are jointly, severally and vicariously liable to pay any compensation to the claimants. In fact, no accident took place,as alleged. Ultimately, a prayer for dismissal of the claim-petition has been made. 4. Whereas, respondent No.3 appeared through its counsel and filed written statement raising preliminary objections inter-alia that the answering respondent is not responsible to pay any compensation as mentioned in the claim-petition since the driver of the offending vehicle had no valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident; that the present claim petition is not maintainable because no accident has taken place with the offending vehicle; that the answering respondent No.3 is not liable to pay any compensation as the owner and driver of the offending vehicle have not complied with the terms and conditions of the insurance policy; that the claim petition is bad for mis-joinder and non- joinder of necessary parties; that the claimants have not impleaded the owner and insurance company of the Wagnor car bearing registration -5- No.PB-32-G-2945 in the present claim petition as paries; that the respondent No.1 did not have the valid registration certificate, route permit and valid fitness certificate of the offending vehicle and the offending vehicle was being driven against the provisions of Motor Vehicle Act. The answering respondent has all the defences under sections 147, 149, 157 and 170 of Motor Vehicle Act available to the owner and river of the offending vehicle and that the present claim petition is not maintainable. On merits, it is denied that the deceased at the age of 63 years. It is also denied that the deceased was drawing Rs.20,000/- per month as salary. It is denied that the deceased was travelling in the ill- fated vehicle it is also denied that the deceased received multiple injuries or that he died at the hospital. The alleged FIR is false. The amount claimed is exaggerated. The claimants are not entitled to any amount,as claimed. It is also denied that the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. After denouncing all other averments of the claim-petition, a prayer has been made for dismissal of the same. 5. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed by my Learned Predecessor on 2.4.2016 :- 1.Whether deceased Ram Lal died in motor vehicle accident caused on 27.7.2012 due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing registration No.HR-63-A-4481 being driven respondent No.1 ? OPP -6- 2.Whether the claimants are entitled to any compensation ? if so, to what extent ? OPP 3.Whether the claim petition is not maintainable ? OPR 4.Whether the claimants have not come to the court with clean hands ? OPR 5.Whether the claimants have no cause of action to file the present claim petition ? OPR 6.Relief. 6. In order to prove their case, claimant No.2 Rajinder Kumar stepped into witness box by way of affidavit Ex.PA alongwith documents namely copy of post mortem report as Ex.P1, copy of death certificate opf deceased Ram Lal as Ex.P2, copy of Adhar Card as Ex.P3. Thereafter, learned counsel for the claimants tendered into evidence copy of FIR Ex.P4 and closed the evidence. 7.To rebut this evidence, no oral evidence has been led by the contesting respondents No.2 and 3. However, counsel respondent No.3 has tendered into evidence documents namely copy of the Insurance policy as Ex.R1, copy of driving license of respondent No.1 as Ex.R2, copies of reports Intelligent Investigators as Exs.R3, R4, R5 and R6 and closed the evidence. 8. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the evidence as well as documents on the record with their able assistance. My issue wise findings are as under: -7- Issues no.1 9. In order to prove this issue, Rajinder Kumar Sharma, one of the claimants, has stepped into witness box as PW1 by way of affidavit Ex.PA. He has deposed on the same lines as that of the claim-petition and further stated that on 27.7.2012, the deceased along-with Subash Ram Lal was coming from Morinda towards Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar on Wagnor car bearing registration No.PB-32-G-2945 which was being driven by Subash Sharma and deceased Ram Lal was sitting on the front seat. When they reached near Urna Mour, Urna,, then the offending truck bearing registration No.HR-63-A-4481 being driven by respondent No.1 Parveen Kumar in a rash and negligent manner came from Machhiwara side and struck against the car of the deceased. Due to the impact, the deceased and Subash Sharma received multiple injures on their person. The deceased was taken to civil Hospital Samrala, who succumbed to his injuries on the way to hospital. In this regard, FIR no.94 dt.28.7.2012 under sections 279/337/338/427/ 304-A IPC was registered at Police Station Machhiwara against respondent No.1, copy of the same is proved on record as Ex.P5. 10.On the other hand, no evidence has been led by either of the respondents to rebut the evidence so led by the claimants. Even, the respondent No.1-driver and respondent No.2-owner of the offending truck appeared through counsel and even respondent No.2 filed written -8- statement denying the averments of the claim-petition, but either of respondent No.1 being driver and respondent No.2 being owner of the offending vehicle did not opt to step into the witness box to deny the accident in question. 11.It may not be out of place to mention it here that on an application moved by respondent No.3-Insurance Company on 4.2.2016 for issuing directions to respondents No.1 and 2 for production and supply of copies of documents I.e.FIR, Driving License, Permit, fitness certificate, RC.and Insurance policy of the offending vehicle, instead of filing reply thereto, counsel for these respondents suffered a statement on 24.2.2016 in court to the effect that the doucments I.e.FIR, Insurance Policy and driving license are already on record, original R.C.is with the case-file of trial court of FIR no.94 dt.28.7.2012 under sections 279/337/304-A IPC, P.S.Machhiwara. Copy of the same is applied for and as such no need to file reply to the application and the application may kindly be disposed off. 12.Thus, from the evidence led on record by the claimants, it stands established on record that the alleged accident took place on 27.7.2012 due to rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1 while driving of the offending vehicle bearing registration No.HR-23-A-4481. In this regard, a FIR (copy Ex.P4 ) bearing No.94 datd 28.7.2012 under Sections 279/337/338/427/304-A of the Indian Penal Code, was registered -9- at Police Station : Machhiawara. The fact that the name of the respondent No.1 and the registration number of the offending vehicle is duly mentioned in the FIR itself would leave no doubt about the involvement of the offending vehicle and the fact that it was respondent no.1, who was driving the offending vehicle at the time of the accident. Otherwise also, there is no apparent reason on the file to falsely implicate the respondent No.1-driver at the expense of the actual culprit. However, neither respondent No.1-driver nor respondent No.2 owner of the offending vehicle have opted to step into witness box so as to challenge the version of the FIR. Respondent no.1-driver was the best person to have countered the version of the claimants in so far as to explain the real happenings that took place on the particular day and to counter the claim of the claimants. As already discussed above, the respondent No.1 failed to file any written statement even having availed numerous opportunities including last opportunity and as such, he was precluded from filing the written statement by my Ld.Predecessor vide order dt. 2.4.2016. Since, respondent No.1-driver and respondent No.2 have not dared to step into witnesses box, an adverse inference is required to be drawn against them and in favour of the claimants that their claim has got merits. Reliance in this regard is placed on decisions cited as Bhagwanti Devi versus Krishan Kumar Saini and others, 1986 A.C.J. 331 and Laxmi and Company versus Savitri Devi Aggarwal and others ,1990 A.C.J. 450. It was for the -10- respondents to explain that no such accident has ever taken place much less than the negligence and rash driving of respondent no.1-driver. 13. In view of the above discussed oral as well as documentary evidence on the record coupled with the legal position detailed above, it is held that the claimants have successfully proved that injured Ram Lal received multiple injuries on his person in a motor vehicular accident, which took place on 27.7.2012 due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1, being driver of the offending vehicle bearing registration No.HR-63-A-4481, in the area of Urna Mour,Urna and the injured succumbed to his injuries in way to the hospital. Thus, the issue is decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. Issue No.2 14.The onus to prove this issue is upon the claimants. In order to prove this issue,claimant no.2 Rajinder Kumar has stepped into witness box as PW1 by way of affidavit Ex.PA and he has deposed that the deceased was 67 years of old at the time of his death. He has further deposed that the deceased was retired from Punjab Roadways, Jalandhar and after retrirement, he was doing work of dairy and agriculture and used to earn Rs.20,000/- per month. However, in his cross-examination, he has stated that he is doctor by profession. Jai Kaur was her grand-mother and she has already expired during the pendency of the present petition. He further admitted during his cross-examination that he has no document to -11- show that the deceased retired from Punjab Roadways Jalandhar or that his father was doing work of dairy and agriculture. Thus, no reliance can be placed upon the bald statement of the PW1 qua the income of the deceased. Even, the claimants have not examined any other witness to corroborate the version of PW1. 15.The deceased was aged about 67 years at the time of accident and the same is evident from the copy of the post mortem report of the deceased on the record as Ex.P1. Hence, the age of the deceased at the time of accident is assessed as 67 years. 16. However, in the absence of any reliable evidence the actual income of the deceased having not come on record, this Tribunal is of the view that income of the deceased is to be assessed by guess work. Thus, the thumb rule is that in the absence of clear and cogent evidence pertaining to the income of the deceased, the Tribunal can take into consideration the monthly income of the deceased as a labourer who could have been easily earning anything around Rs.6,000/- per month. Therefore, it is held that the deceased was earning Rs.6,000/- per month. One-third has to be deducted towards personal expenses of the deceased i.e. Rs.2,000/- per month. In the present case, the dependents are three in number and multiplier of 8 as per the age of the deceased is to be applied in this case. Thus, the total annual dependency of the claimants comes to Rs.4,000 x 12 x 5 = Rs.2,40,000/-. In addition to this, the -12- claimants are further awarded a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- for loss of estate and Rs.50,000/- for funeral expenses and Rs.50,000 on account of loss of love and affection. Thus, in all, the claimants are held entitled to the total compensation of Rs.4,40,000/-. The respondents no.1-driver and respondent No.2 owner are primarily responsible to pay this compensation, but since respondent no.3 being insurance company has agreed to indemnify respondents no.1 and 2, it is the respondent no.3 Insurance Company, which shall meet the liability by payment of the above stated award amount. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of claimants and against the respondents. Issue no. 3 17.The onus to prove this issue was upon the respondents. However, no evidence has been led by the respondents to prove this issue as to how the petition is not maintainable. Otherwise also, the present claim-petition is very well maintainable in the present form. Hence, this issue is decided against the respondents and in favour of the claimants. Issue no.4 18.The onus to prove this issue is upon the respondents. However, this issue was not pressed during course of arguments. Hence, this issue is also decided against the respondents and in favour of the claimants. -13- Issue no.5 19.The onus to prove this issue is upon the respondents. However, this issue was not pressed during course of arguments. Hence, this issue is also decided against the respondents and in favour of the claimants. Relief 20.In view of the findings returned above, the claimants are found entitled to compensation of Rs.4,40,000/- on account of death of deceased Ram Lal from all the respondents jointly and severally. The respondents no.1-driver ane respondent No.2-owner are primarily responsible to pay this compensation, but since respondent no.3 being insurance company has agreed to indemnify respondents no.1 and 2, it is the respondent no.3 Insurance Company, which shall meet the liability by payment of the above stated amount. The claimants no.1 and 2 shall share the amount of compensation in equal shares. Respondent no.3 is directed to pay the said awarded amount within three months from today to the claimants along with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of petition filing the petition till the realization of award amount.Counsel fee is assessed at Rs.1,000/-.

Claimant after tendered into evidence documents Ex.C-1 Panchayati Compromise (Ex.C-1 again exahibited by same number), Ex.C-2 admission of deceased Tarsem Lal in Civil Hospital, Ludhiana, Ex.C-3 application to CMO, Civil Hospital, Ludhiana regarding fitness of deceased Tarsem Lal and Ex.C-4 statement of deceased Tarsem Lal closed the evidence of claimants. On the other hand, respondent no.1 (driver/owner of the offending vehicle) stepped into the witness box as RW-1 and deposed through sworn affidavit Ex.RA. He after tendered Raj Rani & Others Vs. Gurmeet Singh & Another -5- into evidence documents Ex.R-1 RC of the offending vehicle and Ex.R-2 copy of Insurance Policy closed the his evidence. 7.This is a claim petition U/s 166 of Motor Vehicle Act, which constitute special provisions for payment of compensation. In this case the victim or the claimant have an option to claim compensation either U/s 140 or U/s 166 of this Act in case of death or permanent disablement as the case may be. The liability determined by claim authority is based upon the principles of natural justice adjudicating upon the issues of respective faults. Loss of earning capacity of the victim at the time of accident is also considered and kept in view. 8.I have heard the contentions put forth by counsel for parties and also gone through the record with their able assistance and my issue wise findings are as under : ISSUE NO.4. 9.Ld counsel for respondnt no.2 filed an application on 06.02.2016 for supply of copy of Insurance Policy, registration certificate and driving license of respondent no.1. Respondent no.1 filed reply to the said application. Respondent no.1 failed to produce the driving license on record. Therefore, this court has taken an adverse inference against respodent no.1 that he has not a valid driving license. Accordingly, issue no.4 is decided in favour of respondent no.2 and against respondent no.1. ISSUE NO.3, 5 & 6 10.Respondents did not press these issues during the course of arguments as such these are decided in favor of claimants and against Raj Rani & Others Vs. Gurmeet Singh & Another -6- respondents. ISSUE NO.1 & 2 11.Both these issues are taken together being interconnected and inter-related. Onus to prove these issues was upon claimants and in this regard claimant Raj Rani herself stepped into the witness box as CW-1 and deposed through her sworn affidavit Ex-CA and stated on solemn affirmation and r eiterated the entire version of plaint that how the alleged accident took place in which her husband Tarsem Lal had died. She further deposed that deceased was under treatment from 08.07.2014 to 28.07.2014 and died during the treatment. Rs.4,00,000/- was spent on his medical treatment, transportation of body of the deceased for last rites. She further deposed that deceased was hale and hearty and was rehra puller through horse and was earning about Rs.40,000/- per month. She further deposed that respondent Gurmeet Singh had entered into panchayati compromise with them which was executed in the house of Ex-MLA and was scribed by HC Gurpreet Singh no.2776, P.S Sarabha Nagar, Ludhiana which was proved by her on record as Mark A wherein respondent no.1 Gurmeet Singh agreed to pay the expenses of medical treatment of deceased Tarsem Lal. Continuing further, she has examined Manohar Lal as CW-2, Manohar Lal was one of the witness of Panchayati compromise Ex.C-1 (again exhibited as Ex.C-1) and he has duly proved the panchayati compromise. Paramjit Kaur as CW-3 who have corroborated the entire version of CW-1. All these witnesses were duly cross-examined by learned counsel for respondents no.1 & 2. During the course of cross Raj Rani & Others Vs. Gurmeet Singh & Another -7- examination, nothing advantageous could be elicited from their mouth which could be beneficial to the respondents. On the other hand, respondent no.1 Gurmeet Singh stepped into the witness box as RW-1 and deposed through his duly sworn affidavit Ex.RA. He stated that the actual registration number of the offending vehicle is PB-10-EN-6065. He also placed on record copy of RC as Ex.R-1. He also placed on record copy of Insurance Policy as Ex.R-2. During cross examination he admitted the fact he has not placed on record copy of his driving license valid on 08.07.2014 to drive the vehicle bearing no.PB-10-EN- 6065. The said witness of respondent is not sufficient to rebut the case of claimants. CW-1 Raj Rani and CW-2 Manohar Lal fully proved the accident by panchayati compromise Ex.C-1 caused by respondent no.1 while driving the offending vehilce rashly and negligently without blowing any horn. The evidence, adduced on record, by the claimants, as discussed above, has gone un-rebutted and unchallenged qua respondent no.1 (owner and driver) of the offending vehicle. Thence, as a result of aforesaid discussion, the issue no.1 & 2 are decided accordingly in favour of claimants and against respondents no.1 & 2. 12.Averting to the quantum of compensation to be awarded to the claimants. The claimants have claimed Rs.20,00,000/- as compensation. It was only with a sole object to bring about uniformity & consistency in awarding compensation that Hon'ble Apex Court of India gave clear cut directions to various Tribunals/Courts working throughout length & breadth of this country to work on various determining factors. Hon'ble apex Court while making above said Raj Rani & Others Vs. Gurmeet Singh & Another -8- observations in a celebrated judgment titled Sarla Verma and others versus Delhi Transport Corporation & Others 2009 ACJ 1298 , culled the observations made by Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in Trilok Chandra's case as follows : “We thought it necessary to reiterate the method of working out 'just' compensation because, of late, we have noticed from the awards made by Tribunals and Courts that the principle on which the multiplier method was developed has been lost sight of and once again a hybrid method based on the subjectivity of Tribunal/court has surfaced, introducing uncertainty and lack of reasonable uniformity in the matter of determination of compensation. It must be realized that the Tribunal/Court has to determine a fair amount of compensation awardable to the victim of an accident which must be proportionate to the injury caused”. 13.Claimants have claimed compensation to the tune of Rs.20,00,000/- (Rupees Twenty Lacs only). This is how in this exercise various steps are required to be taken by the Tribunal very well spelt out by the Hon'ble Court in the above stated decision. As per the guidelines prescribed therein, three steps are to be followed for determining the exact amount of compensation. In step No.1 the income of the deceased is to be determined out of which the deduction is to be made which the deceased would have spent on himself or herself by way of personal expenses. Basically, the Tribunal had to look out three things which of course are required to be established by the claimant party. These are : age of the deceased, income of the Raj Rani & Others Vs. Gurmeet Singh & Another -9- deceased and number of dependents. In addition to this, Tribunal has also to determine the loss of dependency and it has to work out the same after taking into consideration additions/deductions to be made to find out the income of the deceased. Further the deductions to be made towards the personal and living expenses of the deceased and finally multiplier to be applied in reference with the age of the deceased. It was also with an object to standardize all these determinants that Hon'ble Supreme Court had laid out entire criteria so as to bring about uniformity in the awards passed by the various Tribunals across the country in motor accident claims cases. In order to arrive at exact amount, three steps are adopted by the Tribunal. In step No.1 multiplicand is to be ascertained and for doing so the income of the deceased per annum is calculated after deducting income tax out of which other deductions to be made in regard to the amount which the deceased would have spent for personal and living expenses and balance was to be contributed towards all the dependents of the family members. In second step multiplier is to be ascertained and for this purpose also the learned Apex Court laid out detailed criteria depending upon the age of the deceased based upon the number of years he would have lived or worked but for unfortunate accident and then final step is to calculate the actual compensation. 14.Applying this yardstick to the facts & circumstances of the instant claim petition, claimant has claimed was 65 years old. As per Ex.C-1 age of the deceased is mentioned as 65 years old. In the given circumstances, I take his age as 65 years on the date of his death. In Raj Rani & Others Vs. Gurmeet Singh & Another -10- that event, the suitable multiplier would be 7. 15.Further if we take into consideration various averments the deceased was stated to be working as cart puller (rehra puller) and earns Rs.30,000/- per month working as cart puller. In order to prove his earnings from the working as cart puller claimant did not tender any document which shows that deceased Tarsem Lal was self employed and was earning Rs.30,000/- per month. Claimant examined Manohar Lal and Paramjit Kaur as CW-2 and CW-3 respectively who reiterated the entire version of plaint and also deposed regarding the working of deceased Tarsem Lal and was earning Rs.30,000/- per month. Thus, I take the monthly income of deceased as Rs.8000/- (un-skilled) as if he had been earning by doing the work of cart puller. Deceased is survived by his LRs namely wife, one daughter and two sons . In this back drop, 1/4th of income of deceased is liable to be deducted as personal and living expenses. 16.It will be just and fair and equitable in the absence of evidence to the contrary for higher expenses to award at least a sum of Rs.25,000/- as funeral expenses. Moreover, Hon'ble Lordships have also held that consortium is the right of the spouse to the company, care, help, comfort, guidance, society, solace, affection and sexual relations with his or her mate. Therefore, it would be appropriate for the Courts to award at least Rs.1,00,000/- for loss of consortium. 17.Finally, the following calculation will give us amount of compensation to be awarded to the claimants : Raj Rani & Others Vs. Gurmeet Singh & Another -11- S.No. HEADS CALCULATION (i) Salary/earning Rs.8000/- per month + 20% future prospectus =Rs.9600/- per month. (ii) 1/4th deducted as personal expenses of the deceasedRs.9600/- minus Rs. 2400/- = Rs. 7200/- per month. (iv) Compensation after multiplier of 7 is appliedRs.6,04,800/- (v) Loss of consortiumRs. 01,00,000/- (vi) Funeral expensesRs.25,000-00 (vii) Love & Affection to childrenRs. 50,000/- each (three children) (viii) Total Rs. 8,79,800/- 18. In view of above discussion, issue under discussion is held in favour of claimants to the extent stated above. RELIEF 19. In view of my findings upon the above said issues, present claim petition succeeds with costs and claimants are awarded compensation to the tune of Rs.8,79,800/- along with interest rate @ 7.5% from the date of filing claim petition ie 02.02.2015 till the decision of the case, to be paid by respondent no.2 Insurance Company. Since respondent no.1 has failed to produce the driving licence of offending vehicle, it is held that respondent no.2 being insurance company shall pay the compensation amount to claimants, but if so advised, it shall be at liberty to recover the same from respondent no.1 for having violated the terms and conditions of insurance policy. This amount is to be paid by the Insurance company within two months from the receipt of Raj Rani & Others Vs. Gurmeet Singh & Another -12- Award failing which claimants are also entitled future interest at the rate of 6% per annum, till the realization of total amount. The Award amount shall be apportioned amongst the claimants as under:- (i) Claimant No.1 = ( 70 % ) (ii) Claimant No.2 = ( 10 %) (iii) Claimant no.3 = ( 10 %) (iv) Claimant no.4 = ( 10 %) 20.In view of latest decision in Civil Revision No.7407 of 2010 by the Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court dated 03.06.2011 in case 'Jyoti Burmi Vs. Anusandeep Burmi' , now it is desirable that if claimants have any account in the Bank, then they will intimate to this court within one month and by way of notice to the respondents after receipt of certified copy of judgment. After this compliance, respondent no.2 is ordered to pay the award amount directly in the account of claimants no.1 to 4 by way of RTGS or by way of draft or cross cheque so that cumbersome procedure of deposit and withdrawal from the court could be avoided by both the parties to save their own time as well as precious time of the court. 21.Counsel fee is assessed Rs.1,000/-.

Bhavneet Sharma and Muskan Sharma in a motor vehicle accident. 2. The facts in brief, necessary for disposal of the present claim petition are that on 22.11.2014, at about 11.00 PM, Bhavneet Sharma alongwith his son Joy Sharma, his mother Smt. Ashok Rani who was sitting behind their seat alongwith Khushi Sharma, daughter and Muskan Sharma, wife of Bhavneet Sharma who was sitting on the back seat of Ashok Rani with Anju Bala in Innova Car no.PB-13AF-1818 and were going to pay obeisance at Brindaban, which was being driven by Bhavneet Sharma, claimant no.1, at normal speed on the left side of the road, observing the traffic rules. On 23.11.2014, at about 6.30AM, when they crossed Palwal and reached NH-2, Near Bharat Petrol Pump, Palwal, suddenly a stray dog came in front of the Innova car and in order to save the said stray dog, its driver Bhavneet Sharma stuck against a stationery truck bearing no.UP-80-BT-5215, which was parked in the middle of the road without reflectors and cautions i.e. without any precautions, indicators, placing of stones, branches of trees or lights, which might indicate regarding parking of the truck no.UP-80-BT-5215 on the mettled portion of the road. Due to the impact, all the occupants of the Innova car received multiple and grievous injuries on their person. Joy Sharma died in the hospital, whereas Ashok _________________________________ Munish Singal, MACT, Ludhiana,26.02.2018 Bhavneet Sharma vs. Shalinder Kumar MACP-246-15 17 Kumari mother of the Bhavneet Sharma died at the spot. Khushi Sharma, daughter and Muskan sharma, Anju Bala received multiple and grievous injuries on their person and were admitted in the Govt. Hospital, Palwal and from there they were referred to specialized hospital i.e. Om Supero Hospital and for further medical Management at Ludhiana. It was averred that the said accident occurred due to negligence of the driver of the truck no.UP-80-BT-5215 i.e. respondent no.1 due to wrong parking of the vehicle in the middle of the mettled road without reflectors on the spot to indicate the parking of the truck on the mettled portion of the road. FIR No.619 dated 23.11.2014, u/ss 283,337 and 304-A IPC was registered on the statement of Bhavneet Sharma. It was further averred that deceased Joy Sharma received multiple and grievous injuries on his head, different parts of the body and succumbed to the injuries received by him in the accident. His postmortem was conducted by the doctors of Civil Hospital, Palwal on 23.11.2014. The claimants claimed that they spent Rs.1,00,000/- on treatment, transportation, cremation, last rites, funeral and bhog ceremony of the deceased Joy Sharma. It was further averred that deceased Joy Sharma was 10 years old. He was student of 4th standard and was studying in BCM School, Basant Avenue, Ludhiana. The claimants are the parents of the deceased and He was only son of the claimants. The deceased was very intelligent and sharp in studies and was having good record in sports and extra curricular activities particularly Karate(Teocundo) in which he was taking private coaching at Prime age of 10 years. The deceased had a bright future ahead and his parents had _________________________________ Munish Singal, MACT, Ludhiana,26.02.2018 Bhavneet Sharma vs. Shalinder Kumar MACP-246-15 17 high hopes for him. The claimants have lost love, affection and care of their son on account of untimely death of their son in the accident. The claimants were to be solely dependent upon the deceased in their future and old age life as now there is no other person to look after them. All the hopes of the claimants qua their son Joy Sharma have been dashed into earth on account of untimely deathof their son in the accident caused due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1. It was further averred that the offending truck was insured with respondent no.3 and respondent no.2 was owner of the said truck and the respondents were jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the claimants for the death of their son in the accident due to negligence of driver in wrongly parking the offending truck on the road. 3. Notice of the claim petition was issued to the respondents. Respondent no.1 did not appear despite notice through Publication as such, respondent no.1 was proceeded against exparte. 4. Respondent no.2 appeared through counsel and filed written statement raising preliminary objections that claim petition was bad for mis joinder and non joinder of necessary parties. It was averred that the alleged accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the driver of the Toyata Innova car bearing no.PB-13AF-1818 and the claimants had no cause of action against the answering respondent as no accident took place on account of the rash and negligent act of the driver of the Truck no.UP-80BT-5215. Infact the occurrence took place entirely due to the rash and negligent driving of Toyata Innova Car bearing no.PB-13AF-1818 by its driver Bhavneet Sharma, who not _________________________________ Munish Singal, MACT, Ludhiana,26.02.2018 Bhavneet Sharma vs. Shalinder Kumar MACP-246-15 17 an expert driver and he felt asleep while driving and lost control over the vehicle. It was averred that Bhavneet sharma had concocted a false story that the truck no.UP-80BT-5215 was parked in the middle of the road whereas the truck had been parked on the soil berm on the extreme left corner of the road which was specifically meant for parking of the vehicles. Even the driver of the truck was sleeping in the driver's cabin and had the vehicle been parked in middle of the road, many other accidents would have occurred. It was averred that Bhavneet Sharma was himself responsible for the accident as he was driving the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and fell asleep while driving the vehicle. On merits, the averments made in the preliminary objections were reiterated. 5. Respondent no.3/Insurance Company of the Truck also contested the claim petition by filing reply in which it was averred that the claimants were not the legal heirs of the deceased and the alleged truck bearing registration no. UP-80-BT-5215 was not having valid registration certificate, fitness certificate and route permit at the time of accident and was being driven against the provisions of Motor Vehicle Act, due to which conditions of insurance policy had been violated and hence Insurance Company was liable to pay. It was averred that the driver and owner of Toyota Innova Car bearing no. PB-13-AF-1818 were also necessary parties in this case but they had not been impleaded. On merits it was averred that deceased was not earning any income. It was averred that the driver of the Innova Car was himself driving in rash and negligent manner which caused the accident. 6. From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were _________________________________ Munish Singal, MACT, Ludhiana,26.02.2018 Bhavneet Sharma vs. Shalinder Kumar MACP-246-15 17 framed: 1.Whether the deceased Joy Sharma died in the accident due to the rash and negligent driving of the truck no.UP-80BT-5215 by respondent no.1?OPP 2. Whether the claimants are entitled to compensation, if so to what amount and from whom?OPP 3. Whether petition is bad for mis joinder and non joinder of necessary parties?OPR 4. Whether accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of Tayota Innova Car bearing No.PB-13AF-1818?OPR 5.Whether the petition is not maintainable?OPR 6. Whether the truck bearing no.UP-80BT-5215 did not have the valid registration certificate, fitness certificate and route permit at the time of alleged accident and was driven against the provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act?OPR3 7. Whether the respondent no.1 did not have valid driving licence at the time of accident and was not driving the alleged truck in course of his employment with the respondent no.2?OPR3 8. Relief Thereafter, when the case was fixed for evidence of the claimant, the respondent no.2 did not appear and was proceeded against exparte. The claimant no.1 Bhavneet Sharma himself appeared as CW-1 and also examined CW-2 Muskan Sharma. Thereafter, counsel for the claimants tendered into evidence attested copies of Adhar Card Ex.C.4, attested copy of Medal Ex.C.5, attested copy of postmortem report Ex.C.6, attested copy of school certificates Ex.C.7 to Ex.C.15 and copy of challan Ex.C.16 and copy of Insurance Policy Ex.C.17 and closed the evidence of the claimants in affirmative. On the other hand, counsel for the respondent no.3 closed the _________________________________ Munish Singal, MACT, Ludhiana,26.02.2018 Bhavneet Sharma vs. Shalinder Kumar MACP-246-15 17 evidence by tendering into evidence copy of policy Ex.RX. No evidence is rebuttal was produced by the claimants. 7. I have heard Ld Counsels for the parties and my issue wise findings are as below: Issues no.1 & 4: 8. Since issues no.1&4 are interlinked, therefore they are being taken up and decided together. 9. Ld Counsel for the claimants argued that accident was caused due to rash and negligence act of the driver of Truck bearing no. UP-80BT-5215 as he parked the same in the middle of the road, without any caution sign or indicator, which could not be seen by Bhavneet Sharma and he rammed his Innova car into the truck while saving the car from a stray dog who suddenly came infront of his car. However, respondent no.3/ Insurance company of the Truck has strongly refuted the story of accident put forth by Bhavneet Sharma and has pleaded that the accident occurred due to rash, negligent and fast driving of Innova Car by him. 10. After having gone through the evidence on record, I am of the opinion that the accident occurred because the Truck was parked wrongly on the road, without any indicator, blinkers or caution sign. The driver of Innova car struck against the wrongly parked Truck, while saving stray dog which suddenly came in front of the car. Bhavneet Sharma was driving the Innova car and the accident has been witnessed by him, Muskan Sharma ( his wife) have deposed in the court that the accident occurred due to wrong parking of the Truck. Both of _________________________________ Munish Singal, MACT, Ludhiana,26.02.2018 Bhavneet Sharma vs. Shalinder Kumar MACP-246-15 17 them are the eye witnesses of the accident and they were grilled at length during their cross-examination but nothing could be elicited to show that the accident occurred due to negligence of Bhavneet Sharma. Therefore, the eye witness accounts of Bhavneet Sharma and his wife Muskan Sharma cannot be ignored as it fully proves that the accident occurred because Truck was wrongly parked on the road. It is worthwhile to note that the accident occurred at about 6:30 AM in the winter month of November and therefore due to darkness, the Truck must not have been visible from a distance. The contention raised by Ld. Counsel for the Insurance Company, that the driver of Innova car was negligent in driving the car, is not tenable because if Bhavneet Sharma could notice and try to save a stray dog which came in front of the car, he could have easily seen the Truck, if it was having any blinkers or indicators. 11. There is another aspect of the case that the accident would not have occurred, if the truck was not parked on the road. Admittedly, the place where the truck was parked was not meant for parking of vehicles and it was not a resting place for the drivers. Therefore it was highly negligent act by the driver of the Truck, in parking the same without any indicators, on the road. 12. Ld counsel for respondent no.3 then argued that Bhavneet Sharma started from Ludhiana at 11 PM on 22/11/2014 after having spent his entire day at his work place and therefore he must have been tired at 6.30 AM on the next day after having driven the car for whole night due to which he lost balance on the car and struck it against the parked Truck. I have considered this _________________________________ Munish Singal, MACT, Ludhiana,26.02.2018 Bhavneet Sharma vs. Shalinder Kumar MACP-246-15 17 argument but I do not find any merit in the same because Bhavneet Sharma CW1 and his wife CW2 have stated that they had stopped two three times during the journey from Ludhiana to Palwal and taken rest on the way. It is normally noticed that when a person is travelling with his entire family as it was in the case on hand, he breaks his long journey many times to take rest and for the refreshments for the children and aged. CW2 has stated that they had stopped at a petrol pump just twenty minutes prior to the accident, for refilling petrol and for refreshments. Therefore, it cannot believed that the driver Bhavneet Sharma might have gone into sleep or lost control over his car, due to tiredness or long hours of driving. 13. Ld counsel for the claimants has relied upon case law which fully applies to the facts of the case in hand. In the case of Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs Bannemma and ors 2013 ACJ 2295 , it has been held that if a vehicle is parked in a dangerous position on the highway without displaying parking light or hazard light or without any warning signal at night, it would amount to negligence. In the instant case, we have to examine whether Bhavneet Sharma who was driving Innova car could have expected the Truck to be parked on the road to avoid collusion with it? After having analysed the site plan, this court has reached a conclusion that no one could have expected the Truck to be parked on the road and therefore the question of applying sufficient caution by the driver of Innova car does not arise at all. In the case of National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs Kamaljit Kaur and ors 2013 ACJ 2399 , our own Hon'ble High Court has held that the evidence that Truck was parked during night without any _________________________________ Munish Singal, MACT, Ludhiana,26.02.2018 Bhavneet Sharma vs. Shalinder Kumar MACP-246-15 17 indicator or parking light is sufficient to prove that the driver of the Truck was negligent. In the case on hand, onus was heavy upon the driver of the truck to prove that he was not negligent, but he is not entered into the witness box to make himself available for the cross examination. The owner of the truck and the driver have not adduced any evidence to prove their innocence. It has been held in case of National Insurance Co. Ltd Vs Varshaben Bharatbhai Gohil and ors 2013 ACJ 2150 , and National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs Y. S. Madhavi Latha and ors 2013 ACJ 1969 , that if the truck is parked without any reflectors or lights during night and the police files chargesheet against the driver of the truck, and the driver or the owner of the truck not adduced any evidence, the driver of the truck is negligent and responsible for the accident. 14. In view of my above discussion, the only irresistible conclusion that can be drawn is that driver of the truck was negligent wrongly parking the same on the road without any blinkers, indicators or any caution and therefore the issues no. 1 & 4 are decided in favour of claimants and against respondents no.1&2. Issue No. 3 & 5 15. The onus to prove these issues was upon the respondents but no evidence has been led to prove that the claim petition was bad for mis-joinder and non- joinder of necessary parties or that the claim petition was not maintainable. Respondent no.3 has pleaded that the claimants were not the legal heirs of the deceased but apart from this bald assertion, no evidence has been led to show that the claimants were not the parents of deceased Joy Kumar. Hence _________________________________ Munish Singal, MACT, Ludhiana,26.02.2018 Bhavneet Sharma vs. Shalinder Kumar MACP-246-15 17 issues no.3 & 5 are decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. Issues No. 6 & 7 . 16. The onus to prove these issues was upon respondent no.3 but it has not led any prove that the offending truck was not having valid registration certificate, fitness certificate and route permit at the time of accident. It has also not led any evidence to prove that respondent no.1 was not having valid driving licence at the time of accident. There is nothing on record to show that the offending truck was being driven against the provisions of Motor Vehicle Act. Moreover, the question arises that whether there was any necessity for route permit or not. In this case it is to be noted that no evidence has been produced by respondent no.3 that the offending Truck could not be plied without a permit. No such requirement is mentioned in the certificate of registration of the offending vehicle and its Insurance policy Ex.RX. As such it is held that respondent no.3 has failed to prove breach of terms and conditions of the policy on the part of insured, at the time of accident. The offending vehicle was duly insured at the time of accident and therefore, on account of its statutory liability, respondent no.3 Insurance Company is primary responsible to pay the compensation amount as assessed by this Tribunal. However, Insurance Company can escape from its liability, if it is able to prove breach of terms and conditions of Insurance Policy on the part of insured i.e. registered owner of the offending truck. 29. In this case, it is claimed by Insurance Company that at the time of accident, _________________________________ Munish Singal, MACT, Ludhiana,26.02.2018 Bhavneet Sharma vs. Shalinder Kumar MACP-246-15 17 respondent no.1 was not having a valid and effective driving licence . 17. It is to be noted that driving license of respondent no.1 has not been tendered in evidence. However, the same must have been part of the judicial file in a criminal case in FIR no. 619 dated 23.11.2014 pending against the driver at district Palwal, which could have been summoned by the respondent no.3 for verification of the driving license. Therefore, onus was upon the Insurance Company to prove that said driving licence was not valid or effective for any reason whatsoever. However, respondent no.3 - Insurance Company has not produced any evidence whatsoever to prove that said driving licence was invalid or in-effective. It was required for the Insurance Company to produce positive evidence so as to prove that driving licence of respondent no.1 was fake. Respondent no.3 has failed to discharge this onus. So, it is held that Insurance Company cannot escape from its liability. Consequent to above discussion, both issues no.6 & 7 are accordingly decided against respondent no.3. Issue no. 2 : 18. Since it has been proved, that the accident occurred due to the rash and negligent act committed by respondent no.1, i.e. the driver of offending truck, which was parked on the road without any indicator, blinker or hazard light, therefore the claimants are entitled to compensation on account of the death of Joy Sharma who was travelling in the Innova Car, which struck against the wrongly parked truck. _________________________________ Munish Singal, MACT, Ludhiana,26.02.2018 Bhavneet Sharma vs. Shalinder Kumar MACP-246-15 17 Ld. Counsel for respondent no.3 argued that the claimants were not entitled to any compensation on account of death of their son Joy Sharma because he was not earning anything and was just 10 years old. I have considered this argument but not convinced with the same because in case of Reshma Kumari Versus Madan Mohan 2013 (2) R.C.R. (Civil) 660 (Supreme Court) , it was held that in cases where the age of the deceased is upto 15 years, irrespective of the Section 166 or Section 163A under which the claim for compensation has been made, the claimants are entitled to compensation and multiplier of 15 and the assessment as indicated in the Second Schedule subject to correction as pointed out in Column (6) of the table in Sarla Verma Versus Delhi Transport Corporation, 2009(3) R.C.R. (Civil) 77 (Supreme Court) should be followed. Under para 6 of the Second Schedule of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 notional income of non-earning person for compensation is liable to be treated as Rs.15,000/- Under para No. 1 of the Second Schedule of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 in case of child up to 15 years of age, multiplier of 15 has to be applied to notional income of Rs.15,000/- per annum. Under para No.3 of the Second Schedule of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 amount of Rs.2,000/- can be awarded towards funeral expenses and Rs.2500/- can be awarded towards loss of estate. In the case of Manju Devi vs. Musafir Paswan 2005 ACJ 99 (Supreme Court) the Hon'ble Supreme Court awarded compensation of Rs.2,25,000/- in respect of death of a 13 years old boy by applying multiplier of _________________________________ Munish Singal, MACT, Ludhiana,26.02.2018 Bhavneet Sharma vs. Shalinder Kumar MACP-246-15 17 15 and taking the notional income of Rs.15,000/- as per the Second Schedule of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. In the case of R.K.Malik vs. Kiran Pal 2007 ACJ 2010 22 (Delhi High Court) the Hon'ble Delhi High Court awarded compensation for non pecuniary damages. The aforesaid judgment of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court was challenged before the Ho'nble Supreme Court. The Hon'ble Supreme Court, vide its judgment reported as R.K.Malik vs. Kiran Pal 2009 ACJ 1924 (Supreme Court) , upheld the judgment of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court and granted further compensation towards future prospects. Admittedly, deceased Joy Sharma was aged about 10 years at the time of accident and was non earning person within the meaning of para 6 of the Second Schedule of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and therefore, notional income of deceased Joy Sharma for compensation has to be treated as Rs.15,000/-. When multiplier of 15 is applied to notional income of Rs.15,000/- per annum the compensation payable for death of Prince comes to Rs.2,25,000/-. Therefore, amount of Rs.2,25,000/- is awarded to the claimants as death compensation. Although death of a young son can not be compensated to the parents in terms of money because the said loss is irreparable and irrecoverable yet in accordance with law settled in case of National Insurance Co. Ltd Vs Pranay Sethi and Ors. 2017 ACJ 2700 ., Rs.40,000/- is awarded towards loss of love and affection to each of the claimants and Rs. 15,000/- is awarded towards funeral expenses and an amount of Rs.15,000/- is awarded towards loss of estate. 19. Consequent to the aforesaid discussion, it is held to be fair, just and reasonable to award compensation of 3,35,000/- ₹to the claimants _________________________________ Munish Singal, MACT, Ludhiana,26.02.2018 Bhavneet Sharma vs. Shalinder Kumar MACP-246-15 17 under the following heads:- Sr.No. Head of compensation Amount. 1. Compensation on account of death of deceased 2₹,25,000-00 2. Loss of Love, affection, protection guidance etc. to claimant no.1 being father of deceased ₹40,000/- 3. Loss of Love, affection, protection guidance etc. to claimant no.2 being mother of deceased ₹40,000/- 4. Loss of estate ₹15,000-00 3.Funeral Expenses ₹15,000-00 Total 3₹,35,000-00 ISSUE NO.8 (RELIEF): 20. Consequent to the findings on all the issues as above, this claim petition is accepted with costs. Compensation of 3,35,000/-₹ is allowed to claimants, as mentioned in para no.19 of this judgment, payable by the respondents jointly and severally together with costs and interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of institution of the petition till realization. It is held further that since the offending vehicle was duly insured with respondent no.3 at the relevant time, therefore, primary responsibility to pay compensation amount shall be that of Insurance Company i.e. respondent no.3. 21. It is further directed that 40% of the respective compensation amount of each claimant along with proportionate interest shall be paid to them in cash; whereas remaining 60% of the respective compensation amount of along with proportionate interest, is to be deposited in FDRs in any nationalized bank in their names for a period of 5 years. 22. In order to facilitate the easy release of the amount to the _________________________________ Munish Singal, MACT, Ludhiana,26.02.2018 Bhavneet Sharma vs. Shalinder Kumar MACP-246-15 17 petitioners, it is ordered that respondents no.1& 2 / respondent no.3 insurance company shall deposit the amount directly in the names of claimants, either by way of account payee cheque or demand draft in the Tribunal. The claimants will submit the details of their bank accounts directly to the insurance company under intimation to this tribunal and the cheque/ draft shall be released to the petitioners on an application for release of cheque/draft along with payment order in the name of concerned Manager with directions to disburse the amount as per Award and the details mentioned in payment order by Nazir, who shall submit a compliance report, which shall be made part of the main file. Ahlmad concerned is directed to check the strict compliance. 23. Counsel fee is assessed as 3,300/-. Memo of costs be prepared ₹ accordingly.
