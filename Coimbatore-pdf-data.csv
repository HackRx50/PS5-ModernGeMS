POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle Scorpio Car bearing Registration No.TN 38 R 9218, on 15.05.2010 in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation? 4. If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioner? 6.On behalf of the petitioners, the 2nd petitioner was examined as PW-1 and one Murugesan was examined as PW-2 and one Satheesh Kumar was examined as PW-3 and 7 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P7. On behalf of the 2nd Respondent, no witnesses were examined and no document was marked. POINT No.1:- Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle Scorpio Car bearing Registration No.TN 38 R 9218, on 15.05.2010 in a rash and negligent manner? 7.The case of the petitioners is that on 15.05.2010 the deceased Ramasamy Gounder was resting under the shadow of a coconut tree and was cattle breeding near Rangasamuthiram Pirivu on K.G.Chavadi to Velanthavanam Road. During that time at about 12.00 noon the Scorpio Car bearing Registration No. TN 38 R 9218 driven by one Krishnakumar, the 1st respondent herein, came swiftly from South to North direction in a rash and negligent manner without adhering the rules and regulations in a zig zag manner and hit Rangasamy Gounder in an unexpected manner. As a result of which Rangasmay Gounder succumbed with multiple body injuries. Immediately he was shifted to Coimbatore Medical College Hospital where he was declared as dead. 8.Whereas the contention of the 2nd respondent is that he deny the manner of accident as alleged by the petitioners and further it is the petitioners who have to prove that the driver of the offending vehicle was in possession of valid driving 6 license at the time of the alleged accident. Further they also contend that it is the petitioners who has to establish whether the offending Scorpio Car bearing Registration No. TN 38 R 9218 was insured with the 2nd respondent during the time of alleged accident. 9.This Court has given its anxious consideration on the rival contentions of the parties. Though the 2nd respondent deny the manner of accident as alleged by the petitioners nowhere they have categorically denied the accident. Further on perusal of Ex.P4 it reveals that on 15.05.2010 Rangasamy Gounder met with an accident and PW-2Murugesan lodged a Complaint before the K.G.Chavadi Police Station as against the driver Krishnakumar and he has also narrated the manner of accident. Further on perusal of Ex.P5 it appears that the First Information Report was closed u/s.468 of Cr.P.C as final report was not filed within the time framed. Further on perusal of Ex.P6 FIR was registered as against the driver of the offending vehicle. 10.Further the complainant Murugesan have also examined as PW-2, he could speak about the manner of accident and the complaint given by him before the K.G.Chavadi Police Station. Though he was cross examined but nothing was able to extract against the claim of the petitioners. Further it is admitted fact that in the same accident the driver of the vehicle Krishnakumar and one Subbathal who was inside this Scorpio car were also died in the same accident and 9 others were injured in the same accident. On perusal of the FIR it reveals that the deriver Krishnakumar has driven the vehicle with 10 passengers apart from him. 11.Though the 2nd Respondent contend that the 1st Respondent was not in possession of valid driving license and also drove the vehicle with 10 passengers in violation of the rules no one was examined by the 2nd Respondent in respect of the same. Hence, this court is of the considered view that the driver of the offending vehicle who is solely responsible for the accident. Hence, Point No.1 is answered accordingly. 7 POINT Nos. 2 to 4: 12.The case of the petitioners is that due to the sudden death of the deceased the petitioners were terribly shocked and the day to day life structure is paralysed as they have lost their beloved father. Further case of the petitioners is that but for the negligent act of the driver of Scorpio Car the accident would not have taken place. 13.On perusal of the counter filed by the 2nd respondent it reveals that they have not categorically denied the fact that the offending vehicle was not insured under them and having regard to the fact that the 1st respondent is the owner of the offending vehicle this court is of the considered view that the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. Further on perusal of Ex.P1 post mortem Certificate and the doctor as opined that deceased would appear to have died of effects of multiple injuries and no adverse remarks are made as against the deceased person and there is no dispute in respect of the death of the Rangasamy Gounder. 14.Further on perusal of Ex.P3 it reveals that the petitioners are the legal heirs of deceased Rangasamy Gounder, Therefore, as there is no contra evidence available as against the same this court is of the considered view that the petitioners alone are the legal heirs of Rangasamy Gounder and entitled for compensation. 15.Now coming to the quantum of compensation entitled for the petitioner, the case of the petitioners is that Rangasamy Gounder though aged about 70 years, he was earning a sum of Rs.20,000/- per month by milk vending and by cattle breeding during the relevant time of accident. 16.Now coming to the monthly income of the deceased, the case of the Petitioners is that deceased was a milk vendor and was earning a sum of Rs.500/- per day. How - ever there is no proof for the same. In so far as the income is concerned, that the 8 Honourable Supreme Court had fixed Rs.6,500/- for a vegetable vendor as monthly income in the judgment reported in 2014 (1) TNMAC 459 (SC) = 2014(2) SCC 735 [Syed Saliq vs Divisional Manager, United India Insurance Company Limited] . 17.Thought the petitioners have claimed their father was earning a sum of Rs.20,000/- per month and in support of their claim examined PW-3 however, except the oral evidence, no supportive documents were filed by them. Therefore, taking into consideration of the age of the deceased, this court fixes as the notional income of the deceased as Rs.5,000/- per month. As per the law laid in Saralavarma Case, the multiplier comes to 5 and as the deceased is aged about 70 years, the question of future prospectus will not arise. 18.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives are the dependence of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 19.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may produced to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 20.Therefore, taking into consideration of the evidence of PW-1 and the guidelines of the Hon'ble Supreme Court notional income of the deceased is taken as Rs.5,000/- 9 per month and further as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Sarala Varma case the relevant multiplier is 5 and as per the law laid in the same judgment and taking Considering the fact that there are 2 claimants / dependents in the family of the deceased. 1/3rd of the monthly income of the deceased is taken for the personal expenditure of the deceased. 21.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as t he income of the deceased is Rs.5,000/- ; hence Rs.5,000 x 5 x 12 = Rs.3,00,000/- and 1/3rd personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to [Rs.3,00,000 / 3 ] = Rs.1,00,000/- . And the Loss of Income of the deceased comes to [Rs.3,00,000 – Rs.1,00,000/-] is Rs.2,00,000/- Sl.No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.2,00,000/- 2 Loss of Love and Affection (Each Rs.5,000/-) Rs. 10,000/- 3 Funeral Expenses Rs. 20,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs. 2,30,000/- 22. From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.2,30,000/- towards compensation. And out of the said sum the Petitioners are each entitled for Rs.1,15,000/- of claim amount. Hence, the Point No.2 to 4 are answered accordingly. In the result , the petition is partly allowed and the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.2,30,000/- with interest to the 10 Petitioners, at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months.

Though the PW-2 was elaborately cross examined nothing was able to extract in support of their contention. 10.Therefore taking into consideration of the available materials in hand this court is of the considered view that the petitioner have prima facie established that the 1st respondent alone has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident due to which the deceased died. Hence Point NO 1 is answered against the 1st respondent. POINT NO. 2: Who is liable to pay compensation? 11.Admittedly the 1st respondent is the driver -cum owner of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the insurer and as Point NO. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 12.The case of the petitioner is that the 1st petitioner is the wife of the deceased 2nd and 3rd petitioners are the daughters of the deceased and the 4th and 5th petitioners are the parents of the deceased Selvaraj. 13.Further case of the petitioners is that at the time of accident deceased Selvaraj was aged about 48 years, and he was hale ad healthy at the time of accident and he was working 9 in the Jem Patter works as a turner and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- per month and he also used to get a sum of Rs.5,000/- as extra wages by doing over time. Further case of the petitioners is that the deceased Selvaraj is the only bread winner of the family, and but for the accident he would have lived a long life. 14. Whereas the contention of the 2nd respondent is that it is false to allege that he was getting a sum of Rs.20,000/- p.m and the petitioners are depending upon the income of the deceased Selvaraj, The 2nd respondent would further contend that the claim amount is exorbitant and not sustainable in the eye of law. 15.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or the dependents of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 16.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may proceed to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 17.In order to prove that the deceased was employed and was considerably earning they examined P.W3 Karthiheyan who would depose that the deceased Selvaraj was working in his concern from 2013 onwards and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- of monthly remuneration. However during cross examination he has admitted that though he is running Sree Jem Pattern Works, no attendance register is maintained and his establishment is not registered under E.S.I. and P.F. Act. Further she has also admitted that no monthly salary is paid as such and depending upon 10 the duty the daily cooly is paid to the deceased and in respect of the same no document is maintained by him. On perusal of Ex.X2 it reveals that Srie Jem Works is registered under the Commercial Tax Department and Ex.X3 alleged salary certificate said to have issued by PW3 it is mentioned that the deceased was drawing a consolidated salary of Rs.15,000/- p.m. Further on perusal of Ex.P6 death certificate, It is admitted fact that deceased is died of road accident and Ex.P7 it reveals that the petitioners are the legal heirs of deceased Selvaraj, 18.On analyzing the materials in hand though P.W.3 would deposed that the deceased was employed at his establishment no material evidence is produced before this Court to prove the same. Though Ex.X2, X3 are marked the evidence of PW3 does not inspire the confidence of this Court. Hence considering the age of the deceased as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court Notional income of the deceased is taken into consideration to calculate the compensation. 19.As per the case of the petitioners the age of the deceased is 48 whereas in the post mortem certificate and in the death certificate the age of the deceased is mentioned as 51 Though the petitioners would alleged that deceased Selvaraj is aged about 48 no document evidence is produced to show that at the time of accident the deceased was aged about 48. Therefore the age of the deceased is fixed as 51 and a notional income of a sum of Rs.8,000/- is taken into consideration as monthly wages. And as per the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court a Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 11 and as there are 5 dependents 1/4th of the income of the deceased is deducted for his personal expenditure. 20.As per the latest Judgment Reported in 2017 (2) TN MAC 609 (SC) in the case between National Insurance Company Limited … Vs..... Pranay Sethi and others 10% of the income is taken as addition. Hence 10% of the income comes to Rs.800/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.8,000+ Rs.800/- which is comes to Rs.8,800/-. Hence s sum of Rs.8,800 /- is fixed as income of the deceased. 21.And as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 11 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court considering the marital status of the deceased 1/4 of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 11 22.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as the income of the deceased is Rs.8,800/-. Hence Rs.8,800 X 12 X 11 = Rs.11,61,600/- and 1/4th personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.2,90,400/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs. 11,61,600 – Rs.2,90,400 = Rs.8,71,200/- 23. Further as per the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for funeral expenses, and a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for loss of estate, and a sum of Rs.40,000/- was taken for loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner. 24.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.8,71,200/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/- 3 Funeral Expanes Rs. 15,000/- 4 Loss of consortium Rs. 40,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.9,41,200/- From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.19,41,200/- -towards compensation and the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.9,41,200/ -with interest . 25. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.6,41,200/-of claim amount, and the 2nd to 5th petitioners are entitled for each a sum of Rs.75,000/- of claim amount, Hence point Nos.3 & 4 are answered accordingly. In the result , the Respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.9,41,200/ - with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. And out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.6,41,200/- of claim amount and the 2nd to 5th Petitioners are entitled for each a sum of Rs.75,000/- of claim amount After deposit, all the petitioners are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount with 12 interest immediately.

Further case of the petitioner is that on that day the deceased was proceeding to his company JEM Pattern Works and on the way when he turned to his right after proper indication and sound however all of a sudden the two wheeler bearing registration NO. TN 38 BS 7938 dashed against the deceased vehicle who came in a rash and negligent manner. Due to the said accident the deceased was thrown away on the road and sustained multiple injuries all over his body. Further case of the petitioners is that the 1st respondent is the driver cum owner of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the insurer of the offending vehicle. Hence as the accident had occurred due to the rash and negligent act of the 1st respondent both the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 7.Whereas the contention of the 2nd respondent is that the rider of the offending vehicle was not holding in a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the alleged accident. Hence there is a violation of the conditions of policy. Further they would contend that as the conditions in the policy is violated the insurance company is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 8.Further contentions of the 2nd respondent is that they denied the place, date, time and mode of the alleged accident. Further it is also equally false to allege that it is the first respondent who has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. As a matter of fact it is the deceased who was the root cause of the alleged accident since the accident took place in the middle of the road. 9.This Court as given its anxious consideration on the rival contentions of both the parties. On perusal of Ex.P1 F.I.R it reveals that a case is registered as against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s 279 and 304 (A) I.P.C. On perusal of Ex.P2 rough sketch the place of accident is shown. Further on perusal of Ex.P3 M.V . Report in respect of vehicle driven by the 1st respondent it reveals that the 1st respondent was in possession of a valid driving license and the said vehicle is insured under R2. Hence the contention of the 2nd respondent is that the driver of the offending 8 vehicle drove his vehicle without a valid driving licence false to the ground. Further on perusal of Ex.P4 it reveals that the concerned Police has laid his final report as against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s 279 and 304 (A) I.P.C. Further on perusal of Ex.P5 Post mortem certificate the Doctor has opined that the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries and no adverse remarks is mentioned against the deceased. Further the petitioners have also examined PW2 Dinesh Kumar who is the eye witness to the accident. In the chief examination he has categorically deposed that the 1st respondent has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the vehicle of the deceased. Though the PW-2 was elaborately cross examined nothing was able to extract in support of their contention. 10.Therefore taking into consideration of the available materials in hand this court is of the considered view that the petitioner have prima facie established that the 1st respondent alone has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident due to which the deceased died. Hence Point NO 1 is answered against the 1st respondent. POINT NO. 2: Who is liable to pay compensation? 11.Admittedly the 1st respondent is the driver -cum owner of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the insurer and as Point NO. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 12.The case of the petitioner is that the 1st petitioner is the wife of the deceased 2nd and 3rd petitioners are the daughters of the deceased and the 4th and 5th petitioners are the parents of the deceased Selvaraj. 13.Further case of the petitioners is that at the time of accident deceased Selvaraj was aged about 48 years, and he was hale ad healthy at the time of accident and he was working 9 in the Jem Patter works as a turner and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- per month and he also used to get a sum of Rs.5,000/- as extra wages by doing over time. Further case of the petitioners is that the deceased Selvaraj is the only bread winner of the family, and but for the accident he would have lived a long life. 14. Whereas the contention of the 2nd respondent is that it is false to allege that he was getting a sum of Rs.20,000/- p.m and the petitioners are depending upon the income of the deceased Selvaraj, The 2nd respondent would further contend that the claim amount is exorbitant and not sustainable in the eye of law. 15.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or the dependents of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 16.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may proceed to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 17.In order to prove that the deceased was employed and was considerably earning they examined P.W3 Karthiheyan who would depose that the deceased Selvaraj was working in his concern from 2013 onwards and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- of monthly remuneration. However during cross examination he has admitted that though he is running Sree Jem Pattern Works, no attendance register is maintained and his establishment is not registered under E.S.I. and P.F. Act. Further she has also admitted that no monthly salary is paid as such and depending upon 10 the duty the daily cooly is paid to the deceased and in respect of the same no document is maintained by him. On perusal of Ex.X2 it reveals that Srie Jem Works is registered under the Commercial Tax Department and Ex.X3 alleged salary certificate said to have issued by PW3 it is mentioned that the deceased was drawing a consolidated salary of Rs.15,000/- p.m. Further on perusal of Ex.P6 death certificate, It is admitted fact that deceased is died of road accident and Ex.P7 it reveals that the petitioners are the legal heirs of deceased Selvaraj, 18.On analyzing the materials in hand though P.W.3 would deposed that the deceased was employed at his establishment no material evidence is produced before this Court to prove the same. Though Ex.X2, X3 are marked the evidence of PW3 does not inspire the confidence of this Court. Hence considering the age of the deceased as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court Notional income of the deceased is taken into consideration to calculate the compensation. 19.As per the case of the petitioners the age of the deceased is 48 whereas in the post mortem certificate and in the death certificate the age of the deceased is mentioned as 51 Though the petitioners would alleged that deceased Selvaraj is aged about 48 no document evidence is produced to show that at the time of accident the deceased was aged about 48. Therefore the age of the deceased is fixed as 51 and a notional income of a sum of Rs.8,000/- is taken into consideration as monthly wages. And as per the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court a Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 11 and as there are 5 dependents 1/4th of the income of the deceased is deducted for his personal expenditure. 20.As per the latest Judgment Reported in 2017 (2) TN MAC 609 (SC) in the case between National Insurance Company Limited … Vs..... Pranay Sethi and others 10% of the income is taken as addition. Hence 10% of the income comes to Rs.800/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.8,000+ Rs.800/- which is comes to Rs.8,800/-. Hence s sum of Rs.8,800 /- is fixed as income of the deceased. 21.And as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 11 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court considering the marital status of the deceased 1/4 of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 11 22.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as the income of the deceased is Rs.8,800/-. Hence Rs.8,800 X 12 X 11 = Rs.11,61,600/- and 1/4th personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.2,90,400/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs. 11,61,600 – Rs.2,90,400 = Rs.8,71,200/- 23.

POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle Hero Honda Pleasure bearing its Registration No. TN 38 BS 7938 on 30-08-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 4. If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 5.On behalf of the petitioner, the petitioner was examined as PW-1, and one Dinesh Kumar was examined as PW-2, and one Karthikeyan was examined as PW-3, and 17 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P17. On behalf of the defendants no witness has been examined and no documents were marked. On behalf of the witness 3 documents were marked as Ex.X1 to Ex.X3. 7 POINT No.1: Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle Hero Honda Pleasure bearing its Registration No. TN 38 BS 7938 on 30-08-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 6.The case of the petitioner is that on 30-08-2015 the deceased Selvaraj was riding in his two wheeler bearing registration No. TN 38 Y 3530 in the Coimbatore to Sakthi Main road. Further case of the petitioner is that on that day the deceased was proceeding to his company JEM Pattern Works and on the way when he turned to his right after proper indication and sound however all of a sudden the two wheeler bearing registration NO. TN 38 BS 7938 dashed against the deceased vehicle who came in a rash and negligent manner. Due to the said accident the deceased was thrown away on the road and sustained multiple injuries all over his body. Further case of the petitioners is that the 1st respondent is the driver cum owner of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the insurer of the offending vehicle. Hence as the accident had occurred due to the rash and negligent act of the 1st respondent both the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 7.Whereas the contention of the 2nd respondent is that the rider of the offending vehicle was not holding in a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the alleged accident. Hence there is a violation of the conditions of policy. Further they would contend that as the conditions in the policy is violated the insurance company is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 8.Further contentions of the 2nd respondent is that they denied the place, date, time and mode of the alleged accident. Further it is also equally false to allege that it is the first respondent who has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. As a matter of fact it is the deceased who was the root cause of the alleged accident since the accident took place in the middle of the road. 9.This Court as given its anxious consideration on the rival contentions of both the parties. On perusal of Ex.P1 F.I.R it reveals that a case is registered as against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s 279 and 304 (A) I.P.C. On perusal of Ex.P2 rough sketch the place of accident is shown. Further on perusal of Ex.P3 M.V . Report in respect of vehicle driven by the 1st respondent it reveals that the 1st respondent was in possession of a valid driving license and the said vehicle is insured under R2. Hence the contention of the 2nd respondent is that the driver of the offending 8 vehicle drove his vehicle without a valid driving licence false to the ground. Further on perusal of Ex.P4 it reveals that the concerned Police has laid his final report as against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s 279 and 304 (A) I.P.C. Further on perusal of Ex.P5 Post mortem certificate the Doctor has opined that the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries and no adverse remarks is mentioned against the deceased. Further the petitioners have also examined PW2 Dinesh Kumar who is the eye witness to the accident. In the chief examination he has categorically deposed that the 1st respondent has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the vehicle of the deceased. Though the PW-2 was elaborately cross examined nothing was able to extract in support of their contention. 10.Therefore taking into consideration of the available materials in hand this court is of the considered view that the petitioner have prima facie established that the 1st respondent alone has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident due to which the deceased died. Hence Point NO 1 is answered against the 1st respondent. POINT NO. 2: Who is liable to pay compensation? 11.Admittedly the 1st respondent is the driver -cum owner of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the insurer and as Point NO. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 12.The case of the petitioner is that the 1st petitioner is the wife of the deceased 2nd and 3rd petitioners are the daughters of the deceased and the 4th and 5th petitioners are the parents of the deceased Selvaraj. 13.Further case of the petitioners is that at the time of accident deceased Selvaraj was aged about 48 years, and he was hale ad healthy at the time of accident and he was working 9 in the Jem Patter works as a turner and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- per month and he also used to get a sum of Rs.5,000/- as extra wages by doing over time. Further case of the petitioners is that the deceased Selvaraj is the only bread winner of the family, and but for the accident he would have lived a long life. 14. Whereas the contention of the 2nd respondent is that it is false to allege that he was getting a sum of Rs.20,000/- p.m and the petitioners are depending upon the income of the deceased Selvaraj, The 2nd respondent would further contend that the claim amount is exorbitant and not sustainable in the eye of law. 15.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or the dependents of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 16.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may proceed to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 17.In order to prove that the deceased was employed and was considerably earning they examined P.W3 Karthiheyan who would depose that the deceased Selvaraj was working in his concern from 2013 onwards and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- of monthly remuneration. However during cross examination he has admitted that though he is running Sree Jem Pattern Works, no attendance register is maintained and his establishment is not registered under E.S.I. and P.F. Act. Further she has also admitted that no monthly salary is paid as such and depending upon 10 the duty the daily cooly is paid to the deceased and in respect of the same no document is maintained by him. On perusal of Ex.X2 it reveals that Srie Jem Works is registered under the Commercial Tax Department and Ex.X3 alleged salary certificate said to have issued by PW3 it is mentioned that the deceased was drawing a consolidated salary of Rs.15,000/- p.m. Further on perusal of Ex.P6 death certificate, It is admitted fact that deceased is died of road accident and Ex.P7 it reveals that the petitioners are the legal heirs of deceased Selvaraj, 18.On analyzing the materials in hand though P.W.3 would deposed that the deceased was employed at his establishment no material evidence is produced before this Court to prove the same. Though Ex.X2, X3 are marked the evidence of PW3 does not inspire the confidence of this Court. Hence considering the age of the deceased as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court Notional income of the deceased is taken into consideration to calculate the compensation. 19.As per the case of the petitioners the age of the deceased is 48 whereas in the post mortem certificate and in the death certificate the age of the deceased is mentioned as 51 Though the petitioners would alleged that deceased Selvaraj is aged about 48 no document evidence is produced to show that at the time of accident the deceased was aged about 48. Therefore the age of the deceased is fixed as 51 and a notional income of a sum of Rs.8,000/- is taken into consideration as monthly wages. And as per the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court a Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 11 and as there are 5 dependents 1/4th of the income of the deceased is deducted for his personal expenditure. 20.As per the latest Judgment Reported in 2017 (2) TN MAC 609 (SC) in the case between National Insurance Company Limited … Vs..... Pranay Sethi and others 10% of the income is taken as addition. Hence 10% of the income comes to Rs.800/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.8,000+ Rs.800/- which is comes to Rs.8,800/-. Hence s sum of Rs.8,800 /- is fixed as income of the deceased. 21.And as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 11 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court considering the marital status of the deceased 1/4 of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 11 22.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as the income of the deceased is Rs.8,800/-. Hence Rs.8,800 X 12 X 11 = Rs.11,61,600/- and 1/4th personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.2,90,400/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs. 11,61,600 – Rs.2,90,400 = Rs.8,71,200/- 23. Further as per the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for funeral expenses, and a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for loss of estate, and a sum of Rs.40,000/- was taken for loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner. 24.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.8,71,200/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/- 3 Funeral Expanes Rs. 15,000/- 4 Loss of consortium Rs. 40,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.9,41,200/- From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.19,41,200/- -towards compensation and the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.9,41,200/ -with interest . 25. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.6,41,200/-of claim amount, and the 2nd to 5th petitioners are entitled for each a sum of Rs.75,000/- of claim amount, Hence point Nos.3 & 4 are answered accordingly. In the result , the Respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.9,41,200/ - with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. And out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.6,41,200/- of claim amount and the 2nd to 5th Petitioners are entitled for each a sum of Rs.75,000/- of claim amount After deposit, all the petitioners are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount with 12 interest immediately.

POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle Hero Honda Pleasure bearing its Registration No. TN 38 BS 7938 on 30-08-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 4. If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 5.On behalf of the petitioner, the petitioner was examined as PW-1, and one Dinesh Kumar was examined as PW-2, and one Karthikeyan was examined as PW-3, and 17 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P17. On behalf of the defendants no witness has been examined and no documents were marked. On behalf of the witness 3 documents were marked as Ex.X1 to Ex.X3. 7 POINT No.1: Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle Hero Honda Pleasure bearing its Registration No. TN 38 BS 7938 on 30-08-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 6.The case of the petitioner is that on 30-08-2015 the deceased Selvaraj was riding in his two wheeler bearing registration No. TN 38 Y 3530 in the Coimbatore to Sakthi Main road. Further case of the petitioner is that on that day the deceased was proceeding to his company JEM Pattern Works and on the way when he turned to his right after proper indication and sound however all of a sudden the two wheeler bearing registration NO. TN 38 BS 7938 dashed against the deceased vehicle who came in a rash and negligent manner. Due to the said accident the deceased was thrown away on the road and sustained multiple injuries all over his body. Further case of the petitioners is that the 1st respondent is the driver cum owner of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the insurer of the offending vehicle. Hence as the accident had occurred due to the rash and negligent act of the 1st respondent both the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 7.Whereas the contention of the 2nd respondent is that the rider of the offending vehicle was not holding in a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the alleged accident. Hence there is a violation of the conditions of policy. Further they would contend that as the conditions in the policy is violated the insurance company is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 8.Further contentions of the 2nd respondent is that they denied the place, date, time and mode of the alleged accident. Further it is also equally false to allege that it is the first respondent who has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. As a matter of fact it is the deceased who was the root cause of the alleged accident since the accident took place in the middle of the road. 9.This Court as given its anxious consideration on the rival contentions of both the parties. On perusal of Ex.P1 F.I.R it reveals that a case is registered as against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s 279 and 304 (A) I.P.C. On perusal of Ex.P2 rough sketch the place of accident is shown. Further on perusal of Ex.P3 M.V . Report in respect of vehicle driven by the 1st respondent it reveals that the 1st respondent was in possession of a valid driving license and the said vehicle is insured under R2. Hence the contention of the 2nd respondent is that the driver of the offending 8 vehicle drove his vehicle without a valid driving licence false to the ground. Further on perusal of Ex.P4 it reveals that the concerned Police has laid his final report as against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s 279 and 304 (A) I.P.C. Further on perusal of Ex.P5 Post mortem certificate the Doctor has opined that the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries and no adverse remarks is mentioned against the deceased. Further the petitioners have also examined PW2 Dinesh Kumar who is the eye witness to the accident. In the chief examination he has categorically deposed that the 1st respondent has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the vehicle of the deceased. Though the PW-2 was elaborately cross examined nothing was able to extract in support of their contention. 10.Therefore taking into consideration of the available materials in hand this court is of the considered view that the petitioner have prima facie established that the 1st respondent alone has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident due to which the deceased died. Hence Point NO 1 is answered against the 1st respondent. POINT NO. 2: Who is liable to pay compensation? 11.Admittedly the 1st respondent is the driver -cum owner of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the insurer and as Point NO. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 12.The case of the petitioner is that the 1st petitioner is the wife of the deceased 2nd and 3rd petitioners are the daughters of the deceased and the 4th and 5th petitioners are the parents of the deceased Selvaraj. 13.Further case of the petitioners is that at the time of accident deceased Selvaraj was aged about 48 years, and he was hale ad healthy at the time of accident and he was working 9 in the Jem Patter works as a turner and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- per month and he also used to get a sum of Rs.5,000/- as extra wages by doing over time. Further case of the petitioners is that the deceased Selvaraj is the only bread winner of the family, and but for the accident he would have lived a long life. 14. Whereas the contention of the 2nd respondent is that it is false to allege that he was getting a sum of Rs.20,000/- p.m and the petitioners are depending upon the income of the deceased Selvaraj, The 2nd respondent would further contend that the claim amount is exorbitant and not sustainable in the eye of law. 15.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or the dependents of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 16.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may proceed to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 17.In order to prove that the deceased was employed and was considerably earning they examined P.W3 Karthiheyan who would depose that the deceased Selvaraj was working in his concern from 2013 onwards and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- of monthly remuneration. However during cross examination he has admitted that though he is running Sree Jem Pattern Works, no attendance register is maintained and his establishment is not registered under E.S.I. and P.F. Act. Further she has also admitted that no monthly salary is paid as such and depending upon 10 the duty the daily cooly is paid to the deceased and in respect of the same no document is maintained by him. On perusal of Ex.X2 it reveals that Srie Jem Works is registered under the Commercial Tax Department and Ex.X3 alleged salary certificate said to have issued by PW3 it is mentioned that the deceased was drawing a consolidated salary of Rs.15,000/- p.m. Further on perusal of Ex.P6 death certificate, It is admitted fact that deceased is died of road accident and Ex.P7 it reveals that the petitioners are the legal heirs of deceased Selvaraj, 18.On analyzing the materials in hand though P.W.3 would deposed that the deceased was employed at his establishment no material evidence is produced before this Court to prove the same. Though Ex.X2, X3 are marked the evidence of PW3 does not inspire the confidence of this Court. Hence considering the age of the deceased as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court Notional income of the deceased is taken into consideration to calculate the compensation. 19.As per the case of the petitioners the age of the deceased is 48 whereas in the post mortem certificate and in the death certificate the age of the deceased is mentioned as 51 Though the petitioners would alleged that deceased Selvaraj is aged about 48 no document evidence is produced to show that at the time of accident the deceased was aged about 48. Therefore the age of the deceased is fixed as 51 and a notional income of a sum of Rs.8,000/- is taken into consideration as monthly wages. And as per the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court a Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 11 and as there are 5 dependents 1/4th of the income of the deceased is deducted for his personal expenditure. 20.As per the latest Judgment Reported in 2017 (2) TN MAC 609 (SC) in the case between National Insurance Company Limited … Vs..... Pranay Sethi and others 10% of the income is taken as addition. Hence 10% of the income comes to Rs.800/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.8,000+ Rs.800/- which is comes to Rs.8,800/-. Hence s sum of Rs.8,800 /- is fixed as income of the deceased. 21.And as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 11 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court considering the marital status of the deceased 1/4 of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 11 22.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as the income of the deceased is Rs.8,800/-. Hence Rs.8,800 X 12 X 11 = Rs.11,61,600/- and 1/4th personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.2,90,400/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs. 11,61,600 – Rs.2,90,400 = Rs.8,71,200/- 23. Further as per the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for funeral expenses, and a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for loss of estate, and a sum of Rs.40,000/- was taken for loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner. 24.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.8,71,200/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/- 3 Funeral Expanes Rs. 15,000/- 4 Loss of consortium Rs. 40,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.9,41,200/- From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.19,41,200/- -towards compensation and the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.9,41,200/ -with interest . 25. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.6,41,200/-of claim amount, and the 2nd to 5th petitioners are entitled for each a sum of Rs.75,000/- of claim amount, Hence point Nos.3 & 4 are answered accordingly. In the result , the Respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.9,41,200/ - with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. And out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.6,41,200/- of claim amount and the 2nd to 5th Petitioners are entitled for each a sum of Rs.75,000/- of claim amount After deposit, all the petitioners are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount with 12 interest immediately. The court fee of Rs.8784.50/- is ordered to be paid by the Petitioners within one month. The Advocate fees is fixed at Rs.16,412/- to be paid by the respondents by a separate cheque.

The deceased was not having any work or income, and no such company was running. As per the postmortem certificate the age of the deceased was 51years. Hence, the petitioners are put to strict proof with documentary evidence regarding the age, incomes, occupation and dependency. The petitioners are not depending the income of the deceased and they are living separately and are having earnings. The averments that deceased was hale and healthy, and he was the bread winner of the family are false. Hence, the petitioners are put to strict proof with documentary evidence regarding 6 age, income and occupation. x.The compensation amount claimed by the petitioners in Para 22 part I & II are high exorbitant and imaginary. The 2nd respondent specifically deny the claim of compensation for loss of earning, for loss of love and affection, for loss of dependency as the petitioners are not entitled any claim as prayed for. The petitioners are put to strict proof of the same with documentary evidences. The petitioners claim of sum of Rs.20,00,000/- as compensation is very high. xi.The 2nd respondent denies that the TIW (East) Police station registered a case in crime No.635/2015 against the first respondent. Hence, the petitioners are put to strict proof of the same with documentary evidences. xii. The 2nd respondent cravesm leave of this Hon'ble court to take all defenses available to the respondent No.1 under sec 170 of M.V .Act and contest the case on all the grounds apart from those specific under section 149 of M.V .Act. 4. POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle Hero Honda Pleasure bearing its Registration No. TN 38 BS 7938 on 30-08-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 4. If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 5.On behalf of the petitioner, the petitioner was examined as PW-1, and one Dinesh Kumar was examined as PW-2, and one Karthikeyan was examined as PW-3, and 17 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P17. On behalf of the defendants no witness has been examined and no documents were marked. On behalf of the witness 3 documents were marked as Ex.X1 to Ex.X3. 7 POINT No.1: Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle Hero Honda Pleasure bearing its Registration No. TN 38 BS 7938 on 30-08-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 6.The case of the petitioner is that on 30-08-2015 the deceased Selvaraj was riding in his two wheeler bearing registration No. TN 38 Y 3530 in the Coimbatore to Sakthi Main road. Further case of the petitioner is that on that day the deceased was proceeding to his company JEM Pattern Works and on the way when he turned to his right after proper indication and sound however all of a sudden the two wheeler bearing registration NO. TN 38 BS 7938 dashed against the deceased vehicle who came in a rash and negligent manner. Due to the said accident the deceased was thrown away on the road and sustained multiple injuries all over his body. Further case of the petitioners is that the 1st respondent is the driver cum owner of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the insurer of the offending vehicle. Hence as the accident had occurred due to the rash and negligent act of the 1st respondent both the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 7.Whereas the contention of the 2nd respondent is that the rider of the offending vehicle was not holding in a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the alleged accident. Hence there is a violation of the conditions of policy. Further they would contend that as the conditions in the policy is violated the insurance company is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 8.Further contentions of the 2nd respondent is that they denied the place, date, time and mode of the alleged accident. Further it is also equally false to allege that it is the first respondent who has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. As a matter of fact it is the deceased who was the root cause of the alleged accident since the accident took place in the middle of the road. 9.This Court as given its anxious consideration on the rival contentions of both the parties. On perusal of Ex.P1 F.I.R it reveals that a case is registered as against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s 279 and 304 (A) I.P.C. On perusal of Ex.P2 rough sketch the place of accident is shown. Further on perusal of Ex.P3 M.V . Report in respect of vehicle driven by the 1st respondent it reveals that the 1st respondent was in possession of a valid driving license and the said vehicle is insured under R2. Hence the contention of the 2nd respondent is that the driver of the offending 8 vehicle drove his vehicle without a valid driving licence false to the ground. Further on perusal of Ex.P4 it reveals that the concerned Police has laid his final report as against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s 279 and 304 (A) I.P.C. Further on perusal of Ex.P5 Post mortem certificate the Doctor has opined that the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries and no adverse remarks is mentioned against the deceased. Further the petitioners have also examined PW2 Dinesh Kumar who is the eye witness to the accident. In the chief examination he has categorically deposed that the 1st respondent has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the vehicle of the deceased. Though the PW-2 was elaborately cross examined nothing was able to extract in support of their contention. 10.Therefore taking into consideration of the available materials in hand this court is of the considered view that the petitioner have prima facie established that the 1st respondent alone has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident due to which the deceased died. Hence Point NO 1 is answered against the 1st respondent. POINT NO. 2: Who is liable to pay compensation? 11.Admittedly the 1st respondent is the driver -cum owner of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the insurer and as Point NO. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 12.The case of the petitioner is that the 1st petitioner is the wife of the deceased 2nd and 3rd petitioners are the daughters of the deceased and the 4th and 5th petitioners are the parents of the deceased Selvaraj. 13.Further case of the petitioners is that at the time of accident deceased Selvaraj was aged about 48 years, and he was hale ad healthy at the time of accident and he was working 9 in the Jem Patter works as a turner and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- per month and he also used to get a sum of Rs.5,000/- as extra wages by doing over time. Further case of the petitioners is that the deceased Selvaraj is the only bread winner of the family, and but for the accident he would have lived a long life. 14. Whereas the contention of the 2nd respondent is that it is false to allege that he was getting a sum of Rs.20,000/- p.m and the petitioners are depending upon the income of the deceased Selvaraj, The 2nd respondent would further contend that the claim amount is exorbitant and not sustainable in the eye of law. 15.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or the dependents of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 16.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may proceed to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 17.In order to prove that the deceased was employed and was considerably earning they examined P.W3 Karthiheyan who would depose that the deceased Selvaraj was working in his concern from 2013 onwards and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- of monthly remuneration. However during cross examination he has admitted that though he is running Sree Jem Pattern Works, no attendance register is maintained and his establishment is not registered under E.S.I. and P.F. Act. Further she has also admitted that no monthly salary is paid as such and depending upon 10 the duty the daily cooly is paid to the deceased and in respect of the same no document is maintained by him. On perusal of Ex.X2 it reveals that Srie Jem Works is registered under the Commercial Tax Department and Ex.X3 alleged salary certificate said to have issued by PW3 it is mentioned that the deceased was drawing a consolidated salary of Rs.15,000/- p.m. Further on perusal of Ex.P6 death certificate, It is admitted fact that deceased is died of road accident and Ex.P7 it reveals that the petitioners are the legal heirs of deceased Selvaraj, 18.On analyzing the materials in hand though P.W.3 would deposed that the deceased was employed at his establishment no material evidence is produced before this Court to prove the same. Though Ex.X2, X3 are marked the evidence of PW3 does not inspire the confidence of this Court. Hence considering the age of the deceased as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court Notional income of the deceased is taken into consideration to calculate the compensation. 19.As per the case of the petitioners the age of the deceased is 48 whereas in the post mortem certificate and in the death certificate the age of the deceased is mentioned as 51 Though the petitioners would alleged that deceased Selvaraj is aged about 48 no document evidence is produced to show that at the time of accident the deceased was aged about 48. Therefore the age of the deceased is fixed as 51 and a notional income of a sum of Rs.8,000/- is taken into consideration as monthly wages. And as per the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court a Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 11 and as there are 5 dependents 1/4th of the income of the deceased is deducted for his personal expenditure. 20.As per the latest Judgment Reported in 2017 (2) TN MAC 609 (SC) in the case between National Insurance Company Limited … Vs..... Pranay Sethi and others 10% of the income is taken as addition. Hence 10% of the income comes to Rs.800/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.8,000+ Rs.800/- which is comes to Rs.8,800/-. Hence s sum of Rs.8,800 /- is fixed as income of the deceased. 21.And as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 11 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court considering the marital status of the deceased 1/4 of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 11 22.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as the income of the deceased is Rs.8,800/-. Hence Rs.8,800 X 12 X 11 = Rs.11,61,600/- and 1/4th personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.2,90,400/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs. 11,61,600 – Rs.2,90,400 = Rs.8,71,200/- 23. Further as per the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for funeral expenses, and a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for loss of estate, and a sum of Rs.40,000/- was taken for loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner. 24.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.8,71,200/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/- 3 Funeral Expanes Rs. 15,000/- 4 Loss of consortium Rs. 40,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.9,41,200/- From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.19,41,200/- -towards compensation and the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.9,41,200/ -with interest . 25. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.6,41,200/-of claim amount, and the 2nd to 5th petitioners are entitled for each a sum of Rs.75,000/- of claim amount, Hence point Nos.3 & 4 are answered accordingly. In the result , the Respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.9,41,200/ - with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. And out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.6,41,200/- of claim amount and the 2nd to 5th Petitioners are entitled for each a sum of Rs.75,000/- of claim amount After deposit, all the petitioners are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount with 12 interest immediately. The court fee of Rs.8784.50/- is ordered to be paid by the Petitioners within one month. The Advocate fees is fixed at Rs.16,412/- to be paid by the respondents by a separate cheque.

However due to the rash and negligent act of the respondent he met with the unfortunate accident and died.

However the deceased Subbiyan succumbed to the injuries on 14-08- 2015. 7.Further case of the petitioners is that deceased Subbiyan was a hale and healthy man and running a pressing shop who is aged about 60 years. He is the only bread winner of the family and hence due to sudden demise the entire family is in trouble and the petitioners are found it difficult 4 to run the family without the support of the said Subbiyan. Further case of the petitioners is that from his job the deceased Subbiyan earned a sum of Rs.10,000/- per month. But for the accident he would survived for a further period of 10 years. However due to the rash and negligent act of the respondent he met with the unfortunate accident and died. The Chithode Police Station has registered a criminal case against the respondent for the offences under 279, 304 (A) I.P.C. Hence the respondent is solely liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. The 1st petitioner is the wife of the deceased and the 2nd and 3rd petitioners are the sons of the deceased. 8.This Court has given it's anxious consideration on the contention raised by the petitioners and perused the documents filed in support of the same. On perusal the 1st petitioner was examined as PW1 and 14 documents were marked and one Palanisamy was examined as PW2 who is the eye witness to the said accident. On perusal of Ex.P2, on 14-08-2015 F.I.R was registered as against the respondent for the offences under 279, 304(A) I.P.C and Ex.P3 is the Rough Sketch showing the place of accident and Ex.P4 is the Final Report laid against the respondent for the offences under 279, 304(A) I.P.C and Ex.P5 is the Post Mortem Certificate in respect of the deceased Subbiyan in which the age of the deceased is mentioned as 60 and the doctor has opined that the deceased appeared to have died due to multiple injury, shock and hemorrhage and no adverse remarks are found in the Post Mortem Certificate as against the deceased. Ex. P6 is the M.V . Report of the offending vehicle driven by the respondent Venkateswaran. On perusal of Ex.P6 M.V . Report it reveals that the driving licence of Venkateswaran was not produced and the insurance policy is not also produced by him. Further on perusal of Ex.P7 death certificate of Subbiyan the age of the deceased is shown as 60 and Ex.P8 is the legal heir certificate. 9.As stated already in support of their case the petitioners have also examined P.W.2 who is the eye witness of the said accident.

Further though notice was properly served upon the respondent he remained absent and he was set ex-parte on 17-06-2017. Hence there is no contra evidence available as against the age and income of the deceased the age of the deceased is fixed as 60 and notional income of a sum of Rs.6,500/- is taken as his monthly 5 salary. 11.Further as per the latest Judgment Reported in 2017 (2) TN MAC 609 (SC) in the case between National Insurance Company Limited … Vs..... Pranay Sethi and others 10% of the income is taken as future prospects. Hence 10% of the income comes to Rs.650/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.6,500+ Rs.650/- which is comes to Rs.7,150/-. Hence s sum of 7,150 /- is fixed as income of the deceased. 12.And as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 9 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court considering the marital status of the deceased 1/3 of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 13.Hence, the compensation payable to the petitioners is calculate as follows. The loss of income of the deceased is Rs.7,150 X 12 X 9 = Rs.7,72,200/- and 1/3rd personal expenditure of the deceased comes to Rs.2,57,400/-. And the total loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs.7,72,200 – Rs.2,57,400 = Rs.5,14,800/- 14.

Ex. P6 is the M.V . Report of the offending vehicle driven by the respondent Venkateswaran. On perusal of Ex.P6 M.V . Report it reveals that the driving licence of Venkateswaran was not produced and the insurance policy is not also produced by him. Further on perusal of Ex.P7 death certificate of Subbiyan the age of the deceased is shown as 60 and Ex.P8 is the legal heir certificate. 9.As stated already in support of their case the petitioners have also examined P.W.2 who is the eye witness of the said accident.

Pranay Sethi and others 10% of the income is taken as future prospects. Hence 10% of the income comes to Rs.650/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.6,500+ Rs.650/- which is comes to Rs.7,150/-. Hence s sum of 7,150 /- is fixed as income of the deceased. 12.And as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 9 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court considering the marital status of the deceased 1/3 of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 13.Hence, the compensation payable to the petitioners is calculate as follows.

As this respondent and his granddaughter have sustained grievous injuries, became unconscious condition and took treatment as inpatient, taking advantage the respondent's condition. The father of the deceased, 3rd petitioner herein, has lodged false complaint to the police and suppressed the real fact and filed this frivolous petition. In fact, the accident occurred only due to rash and negligent driving with inebriated condition of deceased, thereby the deceased is alone responsible for the said accident. There is no fault on the part of the respondent. Under the above said circumstances the petitioners are not entitled to claim any compensation from the respondent and totally liable to be rejected in limini. 4. POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the respondent has drove the offending vehicle Bajaj Scooter bearing Registration No. TN B 4405 on 16.08.2015 in a rash and negligent manner ? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation ? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 5.On behalf of the petitioners, 1st petitioner was examined as PW-1 and Ex.P1 to Ex.P15 was marked. 6.As the Respondent failed to cross examine PW-1 he was called absent set ex-parte. Therefore, the arguments of the petitioners and perused the entire records. POINT No.1:- 7.The case of the petitioners is that on 16.08.2015 at about 12.00 hrs the deceased M.Rajagopal was riding his Motor cycle 'HONDA SHINE' bearing Registration No.TN 38 BY 2135 very slowly and carefully proceeding from south to north direction. When he was proceeding in the road, at VMT Nagar junction near 6 lorry Association Oil Company, Thadagam Road, Coimbatore, at that time the respondent who was riding a BAJAJ Scooter bearing Registration No. TN B 4405, proceeding from north to south in a rash and negligent manner without giving any signal and suddenly turned the right side of the road and dashed against the deceased M.Rajagopal's Motor cycle owing to that deceased fall on the road along with his motor cycle and sustained grievous head injuries and all over the body. Immediately the petitioner was taken to CMC Hospital, Coimbatore through 108 Ambulance. Where the medical officers referred with the deceased and informed that M.Rajagopal was died on the way itself. 8.Further case of the petitioners is that the above said accident was happened as the Respondent has violated the basic rule. Hence, the Thudialur Police Station has a filed a criminal case in Crime.No.416/2015 u/s.279, 334, and 304 (A) IPC against the respondent who was the driver cum owner of the said vehicle BAJAJ scooter bearing Registration No. TN B 4405 and the same is pending before the Ld Judicial Magistrate No.1, Coimbatore. 9.Further case of the petitioners is that at the time of accident, the deceased M.Rajagopal was aged about 23 years and he was working as Lorry Driver and earning monthly around Rs.9,000/- p.m. thereby the deceased M.Rajagopal, maintaining himself and his wife vis., 1st petitioner his minor daughter as 2nd petitioner, the parents 3rd and 4th petitioners. The sudden death of the deceased M.Rajagopal placed the petitioners in doll-drum and to suffer very lot both financially and mentally. Due to the death of the deceased M.Rajagopal, presently petitioners are engulfed and trapped by the burden of debts arising out of livelihood and maintaining the petitioners to answer the question of the survival. The Petitioners are just like fish out of water due to the sudden death of deceased M.Ragagoapl. 7 10.Further case of the petitioners is that the respondent is the driver cum owner of the offending vehicle BAJAJ scooter bearing Registration No.TN B 4405 at the time of accident. The said vehicle which involved in the accident was not insured at the time of accident. Therefore, the respondent is the only liable to pay the compensation the petitioner. 11.Whereas the contention of the respondent is that it is categorically false to aver that on 16.08.2015 at about 12.00 hrs, the deceased M.Rajagopal was riding his motor cycle HONDA SHINE bearing Registration No.TN 38 BY 2135, very slowly and carefully proceeding from south to north at Thadagam Road, Coimbatore. The Respondent would also contend that due to the negligence act of the deceased alone the accident took place and because of the accident he and his granddaughter sustained injuries and he was hospitalized for more than one month and spent huge amount of Rs.15,00,000/-. Further the Respondent would contend that the deceased has driven his vehicle in a drunken manner and he also carried two liquor bottles with him at the time of the accident and hence contended that the deceased alone is solely responsible for the accident. However in-order to gain money from the Respondent the 3rd Petitioner has lodge a criminal complaint against the Respondent. 12.On perusal of Ex.P1 FIR, Ex.P2 final report it is filed as against the Respondent and he was charged for the offences U/s.279, 304 (A) IPC. Likewise on perusal of Ex.P5 it is evident the vehicle of the Respondent is also not insured and no fitness certificate was produced before the vehicle Inspector. Of course with a valid license he has driven the vehicle. 13.Similarly on perusal of Ex.P4 it is evident that the vehicle in which the deceased was riding was not insured and Fitness certificate was also not produced before the Vehicle Inspector. However there is no iota of evidence to show that the deceased also contributed to the accident. Admittedly as per the MV report the 8 accident was not due to any mechanical defect of the vehicle of the deceased. 14.On perusal of Ex.P6 Post-mortem report the doctor has opined that the deceased would have died of his head injury. Apart from that no adverse remark is found place in the certificate as claimed by the Respondent. 15.Though the respondent filed his counter disputing the claim of petitioner however failed to cross examine PW-1 in respect of her claim. As there is no contra evidence available as against the claim of the Petitioners and having regard to the fact that the Petitioners have prima facie proved their claim considering the nature and circumstance of the case this court is of the considered view that the Respondent is liable to pay the compensation. 16.Now with regard to the quantum of compensation a s already stated the accident and death of the deceased are not disputed by the Respondent and no adverse remarks found in the Post Mortem certificate. Therefore as there is no contra evidence on the part of the Respondent that the deceased also contributed to the negligence the contention of the Respondent cannot be countenanced with as it is a vague and usual defence raised. 17.Further it should be bear in mind that t he object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or dependent of the deceased. The compensation should commensurate to the loss of dependency suffered by the legal representatives. Therefore it should be just and reasonable, proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 18.Though the petitioner has contended that the deceased Rajagopal has working 9 as Lorry Driver and was earning a sum of Rs.9,000/-, she has not filed any documentary proof to establish her claim. Further she is also not examined anybody in this regard. 19.However, on perusal of Ex.P4 MVI report submitted by the petitioner it appears that the deceased was in possession of the valid driving license, therefore though no document is filed to prove that he was employed as a driver and was earning Rs.9000/- p.m. at least the petitioner is able to establish the her deceased husband knew driving and was in possession of valid driving license. 20.In a given case, if the claim made is so exorbitant or if the claim made is contrary to ground realities, the Tribunal may not accept the claim and may proceed to determine the possible income by resorting to some guess work, which may include the ground realities prevailing at the relevant point of time. It depends on the facts of each case. Therefore on perusal of the entire evidence and upon the settled law this court is of the considered view that income can be guesstimated and the monthly income is fixed at Rs.3,000/-pm. 21.The sufferings and sorrows, mental agonies and hard ship that are undergone by the petitioners cannot be compensated by any means or kinds and they are incapable of mere monetary measures of calculations. However, they should be compensated to the extent to which they are practically possible in this material. On perusal of Ex.P7 death certificate the age of the deceased is mentioned that 23 years. The petitioner has marked Ex.P8 Legal Heir-ship certificate in order to prove that the petitioners are LRs of the deceased Rajagopal. Therefore upon the settled law on this point this court is of the considered view that income can be calculated and by applying the Multiplier as per the dictum laid down by the Apex court in Sarala Varma case the Multiplier is 18 which is the proper multiplier for assessing the income of the deceased. 10 22.With regard to the claim of consortium the Hono’ble Supreme Court in the case between Rajesh and Others V Rajbir Singh reported in 2013 ACJ 1403 had held that the wife is entitled for consortium to the extent of Rs.1,00,000/-. For better appreciation the relevant paragraph is reproduced below for better understanding. “20. We may therefore, revisit the practice of awarding compensation under conventional heads, Loss of Consortium to the spouse, Loss of Love, care and guidance to children and Funeral Expenses. It may be noted that the sum of Rs.2,500/- to Rs.10,000/- in those heads was fixed several decades ago and having regard to inflation factor, the some needs to be increased. In Sarla Varma's case (supra), it was held that Compensation for Loss of Consortium should be in the range of Rs.5,000/- to Rs.10,000/- In legal parlance, 'consortium' is the right of the spouse to the Company, care, help, comfort, guidance, society, solace, affection and sexual relations with his or her mate. That non-pecuniary head of damages has not been properly understood by our Courts. The Loss of Companionship, Love, Care and Protection, etc., the spouse is entitled to get, has to be compensated appropriately. The Concept of Non- Pecuniary Damage for Loss of Consortium' is one of the major head of award of Compensation in other parts of the world more particularly in the United States of America, Australia, etc., English Courts have also recognized the right of a spouse to get Compensation even during the period of temporary disablement. By Loss of Consortium, the Courts have made an attempt to compensate the loss of spouse's affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations during the future years. Unlike the Compensation awarded in other countries and other jurisdictions, since the Legal Heirs are otherwise adequately compensated for the Pecuniary Loss,it 11 would not be proper to award a major amount under the head. Hence, we are of the view that it would only be just and reasonable that the Courts award at least rupees one lakh for Loss of Consortium”. and following above judgment, in the present case, considering the age of the deceased, I hold that the 1st petitioner being the wife is entitled to a sum of Rs.1,00,000/-. 23.By applying the Multiplier as per the dictum laid down by the Apex court in Sarala Varma case the Multiplier is 18 which is the proper multiplier for assessing the income of the deceased. As per the law laid down in Sarala Varma case 1/4 of the amount is to be deducted for personal expenses. Considering the age of the deceased and in view of the dictum laid down by the apex court 1/4th of the total income is deducted for personal expenses of the deceased. As such the calculation of loss of income can be calculated as follows; Loss of income of deceased is Rs. 3,000/- and Multiplier is 18, future prospectus 1,500/- total 4,500/-and Personal expenses to be deducted is ¼. As such Rs.4,500 X 12 X 18 = Rs.9,72,000/- Rs.9,72,000 – Rs.2,43,000/- = Rs.7,29,000/- 1. Loss of Income -Rs.7,29,000/- 2. Love and Affection -Rs. 1,00,000/- 3. Loss of consortium -Rs. 1,00,000/- 4. Transportation from hospital -Rs. 1,000/- 5. Damages to clothing & articles -Rs. 2,000/- ----------------- Total -Rs.9,32,000/- ----------------- 12 24.As already held the Respondent is liable to pay the compensation as fixed above and hence Point No.1 to 3 are answered accordingly. 25.Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.3,00,000/- and the 2nd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.2,32,000/- and the 3rd and 4th Petitioners are entitled for a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- each and hence Point No.3 is answered accordingly. In the result, the Respondent is liable to pay a sum of Rs.9,32,000/- with interest to the petitioners at the rate of 6% per annum, from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with interest, and the 2nd petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.2,32,000/- with interest and the 3rd and 4th Petitioners are entitled for a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- each with interest. After deposit, the 1st petitioner is permitted to withdraw half of her share immediately and the balance Rs.1,50,000/- with interest of her share is to be deposited in any nationalized bank for three years and with regard to the share of the minor 2nd Petitioner is concerned it shall be deposited in any nationalized bank till she attains her majority and the 3rd and 4th Petitioners are permitted to withdraw their entire amount with interest. The court fee of Rs.8692.50- is ordered to be paid by the petitioners within 15 days. The Advocate fees is fixed at Rs.16,320/- to be paid by the Respondent by a separate cheque.

But for the accident he would have lived around about 10 more years and put his service in the above said work which would have been most helpful for him and his whole family since he was the only person and bread winner of his whole family. iv.Due to the death of the deceased entire family is in trouble and before the demise of this deceased the entire family was in his shoulder he only did all the entire family commitments. The 1st petitioner is the wife, 2nd, 3rd petitioners are the sons of the deceased Subbiyan. The whole family is in pathetic condition. This sudden accident pulled them down into a deep valley which they have to get themselves and come out of the situation, which is the irreparable loss to the family. v.The deceased namely Subbiyan was drawing a sum of Rs.10,000/- per month which was made the family to survive. The entire family was depending on his income alone. Due to the said accident his family put into great struggle for the day to day life. The petitioners 1 to 3 are facing lot of troubles due to the demise of the deceased. The 1st petitioner is not working anywhere. So the family is in very much trouble to come out this situation. Hence the petitioner 1 to 3 have filed the present claim petition for a sum of Rs.20,00,000/- from the respondents by way of compensation and damages from their movable or immovable properties. The accident took pace at near Periyavaikalmedu in the Coimbatore to Salem NH 47 Road which fell within the limits of Chithode Police Station, Erode. The said police have registered a case against the driver of the vehicle TN 39 BD 3 6039 in Cr.

POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the respondent has drove the offending vehicle car bearing its Registration No. 39 BD 6039 on 13-08-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 4. If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 5.On behalf of the petitioner, the 1st petitioner was examined as PW-1 and one Palanisamy was examined as PW-2 and 14 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to P14. On behalf of the Respondent no witness has been examined and no documents were marked. On behalf of the witness one document was marked as Ex.X1. POINT No.1 to 4: 6.The case of the petitioners is that on 13-08-2015 at about 18 hours the deceased Subbiyan was standing in the nearby Periyavaikalmedu Bus stop. At the time the respondent drove his car bearing registration No. TN 39 BD 6039 in a rash and negligent manner without following the rules and dashed against the deceased Subbiyan. Due to the said accident he sustained severe injuries all over the body and immediately he was taken to Vijaya Hi-tech Hospital. Later shifted to Government Hospital, Erode. However the deceased Subbiyan succumbed to the injuries on 14-08- 2015. 7.Further case of the petitioners is that deceased Subbiyan was a hale and healthy man and running a pressing shop who is aged about 60 years. He is the only bread winner of the family and hence due to sudden demise the entire family is in trouble and the petitioners are found it difficult 4 to run the family without the support of the said Subbiyan. Further case of the petitioners is that from his job the deceased Subbiyan earned a sum of Rs.10,000/- per month. But for the accident he would survived for a further period of 10 years. However due to the rash and negligent act of the respondent he met with the unfortunate accident and died. The Chithode Police Station has registered a criminal case against the respondent for the offences under 279, 304 (A) I.P.C. Hence the respondent is solely liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. The 1st petitioner is the wife of the deceased and the 2nd and 3rd petitioners are the sons of the deceased. 8.This Court has given it's anxious consideration on the contention raised by the petitioners and perused the documents filed in support of the same. On perusal the 1st petitioner was examined as PW1 and 14 documents were marked and one Palanisamy was examined as PW2 who is the eye witness to the said accident. On perusal of Ex.P2, on 14-08-2015 F.I.R was registered as against the respondent for the offences under 279, 304(A) I.P.C and Ex.P3 is the Rough Sketch showing the place of accident and Ex.P4 is the Final Report laid against the respondent for the offences under 279, 304(A) I.P.C and Ex.P5 is the Post Mortem Certificate in respect of the deceased Subbiyan in which the age of the deceased is mentioned as 60 and the doctor has opined that the deceased appeared to have died due to multiple injury, shock and hemorrhage and no adverse remarks are found in the Post Mortem Certificate as against the deceased. Ex. P6 is the M.V . Report of the offending vehicle driven by the respondent Venkateswaran. On perusal of Ex.P6 M.V . Report it reveals that the driving licence of Venkateswaran was not produced and the insurance policy is not also produced by him. Further on perusal of Ex.P7 death certificate of Subbiyan the age of the deceased is shown as 60 and Ex.P8 is the legal heir certificate. 9.As stated already in support of their case the petitioners have also examined P.W.2 who is the eye witness of the said accident. On perusal of the deposition of PW2 it reveals that the respondent drove his car in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased Subbiyan due to which he died. 10.On perusal of the available materials in hand it reveals that no documentary evidence is filed by the petitioners to prove the income of the deceased, and on perusal of the death certificate and Post Mortem certificate it reveals that the age of the deceased is 60. Further though notice was properly served upon the respondent he remained absent and he was set ex-parte on 17-06-2017. Hence there is no contra evidence available as against the age and income of the deceased the age of the deceased is fixed as 60 and notional income of a sum of Rs.6,500/- is taken as his monthly 5 salary. 11.Further as per the latest Judgment Reported in 2017 (2) TN MAC 609 (SC) in the case between National Insurance Company Limited … Vs..... Pranay Sethi and others 10% of the income is taken as future prospects. Hence 10% of the income comes to Rs.650/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.6,500+ Rs.650/- which is comes to Rs.7,150/-. Hence s sum of 7,150 /- is fixed as income of the deceased. 12.And as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 9 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court considering the marital status of the deceased 1/3 of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 13.Hence, the compensation payable to the petitioners is calculate as follows. The loss of income of the deceased is Rs.7,150 X 12 X 9 = Rs.7,72,200/- and 1/3rd personal expenditure of the deceased comes to Rs.2,57,400/-. And the total loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs.7,72,200 – Rs.2,57,400 = Rs.5,14,800/- 14. Further as per the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for funeral expenses, and a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for loss of estate, and a sum of Rs.40,000/- was taken for loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner. 15.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.5,14,800/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/- 3 Funeral Expenses Rs. 15,000/- 4 Loss of consortium Rs. 40,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.5,84,800/- From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.5,84,800/- towards compensation and the Respondent is liable to pay a sum of Rs.5,84,800/- with interest . 6 16.Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.3,84,800/-of claim amount, and the 2nd petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- of claim amount, and the 3rd petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- Hence point Nos. 1 to 4 are answered accordingly.

However the deceased Subbiyan succumbed to the injuries on 14-08- 2015. 7.Further case of the petitioners is that deceased Subbiyan was a hale and healthy man and running a pressing shop who is aged about 60 years. He is the only bread winner of the family and hence due to sudden demise the entire family is in trouble and the petitioners are found it difficult 4 to run the family without the support of the said Subbiyan. Further case of the petitioners is that from his job the deceased Subbiyan earned a sum of Rs.10,000/- per month. But for the accident he would survived for a further period of 10 years. However due to the rash and negligent act of the respondent he met with the unfortunate accident and died. The Chithode Police Station has registered a criminal case against the respondent for the offences under 279, 304 (A) I.P.C. Hence the respondent is solely liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. The 1st petitioner is the wife of the deceased and the 2nd and 3rd petitioners are the sons of the deceased. 8.This Court has given it's anxious consideration on the contention raised by the petitioners and perused the documents filed in support of the same. On perusal the 1st petitioner was examined as PW1 and 14 documents were marked and one Palanisamy was examined as PW2 who is the eye witness to the said accident. On perusal of Ex.P2, on 14-08-2015 F.I.R was registered as against the respondent for the offences under 279, 304(A) I.P.C and Ex.P3 is the Rough Sketch showing the place of accident and Ex.P4 is the Final Report laid against the respondent for the offences under 279, 304(A) I.P.C and Ex.P5 is the Post Mortem Certificate in respect of the deceased Subbiyan in which the age of the deceased is mentioned as 60 and the doctor has opined that the deceased appeared to have died due to multiple injury, shock and hemorrhage and no adverse remarks are found in the Post Mortem Certificate as against the deceased. Ex. P6 is the M.V . Report of the offending vehicle driven by the respondent Venkateswaran. On perusal of Ex.P6 M.V . Report it reveals that the driving licence of Venkateswaran was not produced and the insurance policy is not also produced by him. Further on perusal of Ex.P7 death certificate of Subbiyan the age of the deceased is shown as 60 and Ex.P8 is the legal heir certificate. 9.As stated already in support of their case the petitioners have also examined P.W.2 who is the eye witness of the said accident.

Further though notice was properly served upon the respondent he remained absent and he was set ex-parte on 17-06-2017. Hence there is no contra evidence available as against the age and income of the deceased the age of the deceased is fixed as 60 and notional income of a sum of Rs.6,500/- is taken as his monthly 5 salary. 11.Further as per the latest Judgment Reported in 2017 (2) TN MAC 609 (SC) in the case between National Insurance Company Limited … Vs..... Pranay Sethi and others 10% of the income is taken as future prospects. Hence 10% of the income comes to Rs.650/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.6,500+ Rs.650/- which is comes to Rs.7,150/-. Hence s sum of 7,150 /- is fixed as income of the deceased. 12.And as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 9 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court considering the marital status of the deceased 1/3 of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 13.Hence, the compensation payable to the petitioners is calculate as follows. The loss of income of the deceased is Rs.7,150 X 12 X 9 = Rs.7,72,200/- and 1/3rd personal expenditure of the deceased comes to Rs.2,57,400/-. And the total loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs.7,72,200 – Rs.2,57,400 = Rs.5,14,800/- 14.

The deceased Selvaraj was working as Watchman at Water Tank, Sivanantha Colony, Coimbatore and earning a sum of Rs.8,000/- per month. iii)On 04.06.2015 when the deceased Selvaraj was returning from his work by walk and was crossing the road on the Coimbatore , Sivnantha Colony, Tatabad, 4th street junction proceeded from West to East after completely crossed the road around 19.30 hours. At that time the 1st respondent riding her Ford Eco Sport Car bearing Registration No.TN 66 M 2666 in the same road proceeded from North to South in a rash, reckless, and negligent manner suddenly hit against the Deceased violently. Due to impact of the accident, the petitioner fell on the road and sustaining severe head injury and multiple injuries all over the body. The injured Selvaraj was immediately rushed to Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital by 108 Ambulance but the doctor on duty on examination declared them dead. The body was then sent to Mortuary where post mortem was held on 05.06.2015. iv)The 1st respondent who was rider cum owner of Ford Eco Sport Car bearing Registration No.TN 66 M 2666 is exclusively liable for the said accident due to rash and negligent driving. Therefore, the Sub-Inspector of Police, TIW (East) PS, Coimbatore has registered a case against him for the charges u/s.279 and 304(A) IPC in Crime No.418/2015 dated 04.06.2015 and the same has to be tried by the Learned Judicial Magistrate No.VIII, Coimbatore. 3 v)The deceased was active, hale and healthy prior to the accident.

But due to above said road accident and sustaining grievous multiple injuries all over the body and head and due to its complications, he died in the said accident. vi)The petitioners are Son, Daughter and father of deceased. They are totally depending upon the earning of deceased for their livelihood. They are hailing from poor family. There are no other sources of income to them neither form movable nor immovable properties. They had to borrow amount towards conduct of last rites of deceased and towards day to day expenses. Though the value of human being is precious and cannot be measured by way of monetary grant, yet for the sake of social justice and for the livelihood of petitioners in this materialistic world, he has reasonably worked out him claim of compensation under the relevant heads in sub paragraph 21 (a) of main application for a total sum of Rs.10,00,000/-. vii)The amount of compensation preferred by petition is a just, fair and reasonable one. The pathetic situation, mental shock, anguish, hardship and financial constraints of the petitioners are beyond words to explain.

It is learnt that the deceased was under intoxication at the time of the accident. iii)There is no pedestrian cross in the place of accident. The petitioners re put to strict proof, the place, time date and the alleged manner in which the occurrence is said to have taken place. As the 1st respondent or her vehicle were not involved in the above said accident, the Judicial Magistrate NoVIII, Coimbatore, after trial, acquitted the 1st respondent from the criminal case which was foisted against the 1st respondent 5 by police, u/s.255(1) of Cr.P.C. on 28.01.2016.

POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle Ford Eco Sport Car bearing Registration No. TN 66 M 2666 on 04.06.2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 6 2.Who is liable to pay compensation ? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 4.If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioner? 5.On behalf of the petitioners, the 1st petitioner was examined as PW-1 and one Jayakumar was examined as PW-2 and 14 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P14. On the side of the respondents the 1st Respondent was examined as RW-1 and three documents were marked as Ex.R1 and Ex.R2 and Ex.X1. POINT No.1:- 6.The case of the Petitioners is that on 04.06.2015 when the deceased Selvaraj was returning from his work by walk and was crossing the road on the Coimbatore , Sivnantha Colony, Tatabad, 4th street junction proceeded from West to East after completely crossed the road around 19.30 hours. At that time the 1st respondent riding her Ford Eco Sport Car bearing Registration No.TN 66 M 2666 in the same road proceeded from North to South in a rash, reckless, and negligent manner suddenly hit against the Deceased violently. Due to impact of the accident, the petitioner fell on the road and sustaining severe head injury and multiple injuries all over the body. The injured Selvaraj was immediately rushed to Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital by 108 Ambulance but the doctor on duty on examination declared them dead. The body was then sent to Mortuary where post mortem was held on 05.06.2015. 7.Further contention of the Petitioners is that the 1st respondent who was rider cum owner of Ford Eco Sport Car bearing Registration No.TN 66 M 2666 is exclusively liable for the said accident due to rash and negligent driving. Therefore, the Sub-Inspector of Police, TIW (East) PS, Coimbatore has registered a case against him for the charges u/s.279 and 304(A) IPC in Crime No.418/2015 dated 04.06.2015 and the same has to be tried by the Learned Judicial Magistrate No.VIII, Coimbatore. 7 8.Further contention of the Petitioners is that the 1st respondent who was rider cum owner of offending vehicle is exclusively liable for the said accident due to rash and negligent driving. While this being so, the 1st respondent is its rider cum owner and the Motor cycle has been indemnified with second respondent for insurance coverage as on the date of accident. Therefore, the respondents 1 and 2 are jointly, severally and vicariously liable to pay the compensation to the petitioner as claimed. 9.Whereas the contention of the 2nd Respondent is that the petition is false, frivolous, vexatious and not maintainable either in law or on the facts of the case. The insurance of the vehicle of the 1st respondent the Ford Eco Sport Car bearing Registration No.TN 66 M 2666 was covered at the material time of accident under the policy of insurance is issued by the 2nd respondent subject to the terms, conditions exceptions and limitations thereof and the confirmation of Sec.64 VB of the insurance Act 1938. 10.Further contention of the 2nd respondent is that at the outset denies the allegations that the accident took place only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st respondent. The 2nd respondent does not admit the manner of accident as narrated by the petitioner in Col. 23 of the petition to be true and genuine. It is false to state that on 04.06.2015 at about 19.30 hours the deceased Selvaraj was proceeded by walk from East to West direction on Tatabad 4th street, junction and while he completely crossed the road, the 1st respondent came there by driving her car TN 66 M 2666 from North to South direction on the same road in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and caused him death. Neither the 1st respondent nor her vehicle involved in the above said accident. It is learnt that an unknown vehicle hit the deceased and ran away. To get unlawful gain the 1st respondent and her vehicle were falsely implicated in the case. Since the involvement of the vehicle and the driver in the above accident is disputed, the petitioners are liable to prove the accident beyond any doubt. It is learnt that the deceased was under intoxication at the time of the accident. 8 11.Further contention of the 2nd respondent is that there is no pedestrian cross in the place of accident. The petitioners are put to strict proof, the place, time date and the alleged manner in which the occurrence is said to have taken place. As the 1st respondent or her vehicle were not involved in the above said accident, the Judicial Magistrate NoVIII, Coimbatore, after trial, acquitted the 1st respondent from the criminal case which was foisted against the 1st respondent by police, u/s.255(1) of Cr.P.C. on 28.01.2016. Therefore as neither the 1st respondent nor her vehicle were involved in the above said accident, neither 1st respondent nor 2nd respondent are liable to give any compensation for the death of deceased Selvaraj. 12.Further contention of the 2nd respondent is that they deny the averment that the deceased died due to the alleged injuries, which sustained by him in the above said accident. The petitioners are put to strict proof that the deceased got injuries and died due to the above accident by producing relevant medical records, finding and other evidence. 13.This court has given its anxious consideration on both sides and perused the relevant records. It is the specific case of the Petitioners that the 1st respondent was the rider cum owner of Ford Eco Sport Car bearing Registration No.TN 66 M 2666 which dashed against the deceased and caused his death. Whereas the contention of the 2nd Respondent is that neither the 1st respondent nor her vehicle involved in the above said accident. And it is learnt that an unknown vehicle hit the deceased and ran away. 14.On perusal of Ex.P1 FIR it is evident that a case is registered as against the 1st Respondent for the offence u/s.279 and 304-A IPC and based on the FIR final report is filed as against the 1st Respondent vide Ex.P5. Though proper notice was served upon the 1st Respondent she remained and was set ex-parte. And hence the allegations against the 1st Respondent is controverted. 9 15.However the Ld counsel for the 2nd Respondent examined the 1st Respondent as RW-1 in support of their case and contended that on 28.01.2016 as the 1st respondent or her vehicle were not involved in the above said accident, the Judicial Magistrate NoVIII, Coimbatore, after trial, acquitted the 1st respondent from the criminal case which was foisted against her. The order of the Ld Judicial Magistrate NoVIII, Coimbatore is marked as Ex.X1. 16.However the 1st respondent [RW-1] during the chief examination she would depose that, she only drove the offending vehicle on that fateful day. On perusal of her deposition it reveals that she has not informed about the accident to the insurance company R2. However deposed that she was acquitted for the charges levelled against her by the Ld J.M.No.VIII, Coimbatore and hence she is not responsible for the accident and the deceased alone is responsible for the accident. Though RW-3 is a Police Inspector attach to Vigilance department she has failed to inform about the accident to the concerned insurer and she also remained ex-parte. Though she deposes that the deceased died due to the accident however she failed to explain what is the contributory negligence on the part of the deceased. Therefore the evidence of RW-1 itself falsify the case of the 2nd Respondent that the vehicle Eco Sport is not driven by the 1st Respondent and it did not involve in the accident. 17.Further the 2nd Respondent would contend that on the day of the accident the deceased was under intoxication at the time of the accident. However on perusal of the death certificate Ex.P2 there is no adverse remarks find place and hence absolutely there is no evidence to prove the said contention. 18.Further in support of their case the 2nd Respondent marked Ex.R1 and Ex.R2 the deposition given before the Ld Judicial Magistrate Court No.VIII, Coimbatore of PW-1 and PW-2 herein. However on perusal of Ex.R2 it is evident that there is no cross examination done by the defence regarding that he did not witness the accident. Hence on perusal of Ex.R1 and Ex.R2 and having regard to the clear admission of 10 RW-1 that she only drove the vehicle on the date of the accident and her conduct of not informing the accident to anyone being in a responsible post in the Police department this court is of the considered view that the Petitioners have cogently proved the involvement of the 1st Respondent in the accident. Hence point No.1 is answered in favour of the Petitioners. POINT No.2:- Who is liable to pay compensation ? 19.The 1st respondent was rider cum owner of Ford Eco Sport Car bearing Registration No.TN 66 M 2666 involved in the accident. While this being so, 2nd respondent is its insurer at the time of said accident and as point No.1 is answered against the Respondents they both are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation. Hence point No.2 is answered accordingly. POINT No.3:- Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 20.The petitioners are Son, Daughter and father of deceased and they are the legal heirs of deceased Selvaraj and are dependents upon the earning of deceased for their livelihood. In support of it they have marked the death certificate Ex.P3 and the legal heirship certificate Ex.P4 are marked. As there is no contra evidence available as against those documents this court is of the considered view that they are the dependents of the deceased and hence point No.3 is answered accordingly. POINT No.4:- If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioner? 21.The case of the Petitioners is that the deceased was active, hale and healthy prior to the accident. He was merely 57 years old at the time of accident. But due to above said road accident and sustaining grievous multiple injuries all over the body 11 and head and due to its complications, he died in the said accident. The petitioners being are Son, Daughter and father of deceased they were totally depending upon the earning of deceased for their livelihood. They are hailing from poor family. There are no other sources of income to them neither form movable nor immovable properties. They had to borrow amount towards conduct of last rites of deceased and towards day to day expenses. 22.The petitioners are legal heirs of deceased Selvaraj and are dependents upon the earning of deceased for their livelihood. The deceased Selvaraj was working as Watchman at Water Tank, Sivanantha Colony, Coimbatore and earning a sum of Rs.8,000/- per month. Though the value of human being is precious and cannot be measured by way of monetary grant, yet for the sake of social justice and for the livelihood of petitioners in this materialistic world, he has reasonably worked out him claim of compensation under the relevant heads in sub paragraph 21 (a) of main application for a total sum of Rs.10,00,000/-. 23.The amount of compensation preferred by petition is a just, fair and reasonable one. The pathetic situation, mental shock, anguish, hardship and financial constraints of the petitioners are beyond words to explain. The deceased would have lived in good health up till the standard life span more than 10 years if not trapped in the cruel accident. Therefore the claim of petitioner is just and reasonable one. 24.Whereas the contention of the 2nd Respondent is that the petitioners are not Dependants of the deceased. The age of the deceased is denied as false. The allegation that the deceased was working as Watchman and was earning a sum of Rs.8,000/- per month is stoutly denied as false. The petitioners are strictly bound to prove the age, employment, income of the deceased and dependency of the petitioners etc., by marking documentary evidence through competent witness. 25.On perusal of the records it is evident that there is no documentary evidence to 12 show that Selvaraj was working as Watchman at Water Tank, Sivanantha Colony, Coimbatore and earning a sum of Rs.8,000/- per month hence according the dictum of the Hon'ble Apex Court notional income of the deceased is taken into consideration for awarding compensation to the Petitioners. 26.The object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or dependent of the deceased. The compensation should commensurate to the loss of dependency suffered by the legal representatives. Therefore it should be just and reasonable, proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 27.In a given case, if the claim made is so exorbitant or if the claim made is contrary to ground realities, the Tribunal may not accept the claim and may proceed to determine the possible income by resorting to some guess work, which may include the ground realities prevailing at the relevant point of time. It depends on the facts of each case. 28.However during the course of argument the Ld counsel for the 2nd Respondent would contend that on perusal of the rough sketch it is evident that it is the deceased who has violated the rules and he is the root cause of the accident and hence there is a contributory negligence on the part of the deceased also. 29.Repudiating the contention of the 2nd Respondent the Ld counsel for the Petitioner would contend that without any other corroborative evidence the rough sketch alone cannot be taken into consideration. In support of his contention the Ld counsel for the Petitioner relied upon a judgment reported in 2013 (2) TN MAC 685 (DB) in the case between Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Co. Ltd., Vs Ramya & Ors wherein it has been categorically held that in absence of corroboration 13 evidence, no conclusion can be drawn merely by placing reliance on Accident Sketch. 30.Hence based on Ex.P2 Post Mortem Certificate and Ex.P3 death certificate age of the deceased is fixed as 57. and the monthly income notionally fixed as Rs.6,000/- pm. By applying the multiplier as per the dictum lay down by the Sarala Varma case the multiplier is 9 which is proper multiplier for accessing the deceased. 31.As per the law lay down in Sarala Varma case 1/3rd of the total income is deduct for personal income. As such the calculation of loss of income is calculate as follows; Monthly salary of the deceased is Rs.6,000/- and the multiplier is 9 . Therefore, Rs.6000/- x 9 x 12 = 6,48,000/- and personal expenses 1/3rd which comes to 2,16,000/- = After deduction of the personal expenses of Rs.2,16,000/- from Rs.64,80,000/- the loss of income comes to Rs.4,32,000/- 32.The petitioners are entitled for the heads of compensation is as follows ; Sl.No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs. 4,32,000/- 2 Love and Affection Rs. 2,00,000/- 3 Funeral Expenses Rs. 15,000/- 4 Damages to clothing & Vehicle Rs. 3,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs. 6,50,000/- 33. Out of the sum of Rs.6,50,000/- the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.2,75,000/- and the 2nd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.2,75,000/- and the 3rd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.1,00,000/-. Hence Point No.4 is answered accordingly. 14 In the result, the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.6,50,000/- with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.2,75,000/- with interest; and the 2nd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.2,75,000/- with interest; and the 3rd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- with interest.

Therefore, the Sub-Inspector of Police, TIW (East) PS, Coimbatore has registered a case against him for the charges u/s.279 and 304(A) IPC in Crime No.418/2015 dated 04.06.2015 and the same has to be tried by the Learned Judicial Magistrate No.VIII, Coimbatore. 7 8.Further contention of the Petitioners is that the 1st respondent who was rider cum owner of offending vehicle is exclusively liable for the said accident due to rash and negligent driving. While this being so, the 1st respondent is its rider cum owner and the Motor cycle has been indemnified with second respondent for insurance coverage as on the date of accident. Therefore, the respondents 1 and 2 are jointly, severally and vicariously liable to pay the compensation to the petitioner as claimed. 9.Whereas the contention of the 2nd Respondent is that the petition is false, frivolous, vexatious and not maintainable either in law or on the facts of the case. The insurance of the vehicle of the 1st respondent the Ford Eco Sport Car bearing Registration No.TN 66 M 2666 was covered at the material time of accident under the policy of insurance is issued by the 2nd respondent subject to the terms, conditions exceptions and limitations thereof and the confirmation of Sec.64 VB of the insurance Act 1938. 10.Further contention of the 2nd respondent is that at the outset denies the allegations that the accident took place only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st respondent. The 2nd respondent does not admit the manner of accident as narrated by the petitioner in Col. 23 of the petition to be true and genuine. It is false to state that on 04.06.2015 at about 19.30 hours the deceased Selvaraj was proceeded by walk from East to West direction on Tatabad 4th street, junction and while he completely crossed the road, the 1st respondent came there by driving her car TN 66 M 2666 from North to South direction on the same road in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and caused him death. Neither the 1st respondent nor her vehicle involved in the above said accident. It is learnt that an unknown vehicle hit the deceased and ran away. To get unlawful gain the 1st respondent and her vehicle were falsely implicated in the case. Since the involvement of the vehicle and the driver in the above accident is disputed, the petitioners are liable to prove the accident beyond any doubt. It is learnt that the deceased was under intoxication at the time of the accident. 8 11.Further contention of the 2nd respondent is that there is no pedestrian cross in the place of accident. The petitioners are put to strict proof, the place, time date and the alleged manner in which the occurrence is said to have taken place. As the 1st respondent or her vehicle were not involved in the above said accident, the Judicial Magistrate NoVIII, Coimbatore, after trial, acquitted the 1st respondent from the criminal case which was foisted against the 1st respondent by police, u/s.255(1) of Cr.P.C. on 28.01.2016. Therefore as neither the 1st respondent nor her vehicle were involved in the above said accident, neither 1st respondent nor 2nd respondent are liable to give any compensation for the death of deceased Selvaraj. 12.Further contention of the 2nd respondent is that they deny the averment that the deceased died due to the alleged injuries, which sustained by him in the above said accident. The petitioners are put to strict proof that the deceased got injuries and died due to the above accident by producing relevant medical records, finding and other evidence. 13.This court has given its anxious consideration on both sides and perused the relevant records. It is the specific case of the Petitioners that the 1st respondent was the rider cum owner of Ford Eco Sport Car bearing Registration No.TN 66 M 2666 which dashed against the deceased and caused his death. Whereas the contention of the 2nd Respondent is that neither the 1st respondent nor her vehicle involved in the above said accident. And it is learnt that an unknown vehicle hit the deceased and ran away. 14.On perusal of Ex.P1 FIR it is evident that a case is registered as against the 1st Respondent for the offence u/s.279 and 304-A IPC and based on the FIR final report is filed as against the 1st Respondent vide Ex.P5. Though proper notice was served upon the 1st Respondent she remained and was set ex-parte. And hence the allegations against the 1st Respondent is controverted. 9 15.However the Ld counsel for the 2nd Respondent examined the 1st Respondent as RW-1 in support of their case and contended that on 28.01.2016 as the 1st respondent or her vehicle were not involved in the above said accident, the Judicial Magistrate NoVIII, Coimbatore, after trial, acquitted the 1st respondent from the criminal case which was foisted against her. The order of the Ld Judicial Magistrate NoVIII, Coimbatore is marked as Ex.X1. 16.However the 1st respondent [RW-1] during the chief examination she would depose that, she only drove the offending vehicle on that fateful day. On perusal of her deposition it reveals that she has not informed about the accident to the insurance company R2. However deposed that she was acquitted for the charges levelled against her by the Ld J.M.No.VIII, Coimbatore and hence she is not responsible for the accident and the deceased alone is responsible for the accident. Though RW-3 is a Police Inspector attach to Vigilance department she has failed to inform about the accident to the concerned insurer and she also remained ex-parte. Though she deposes that the deceased died due to the accident however she failed to explain what is the contributory negligence on the part of the deceased. Therefore the evidence of RW-1 itself falsify the case of the 2nd Respondent that the vehicle Eco Sport is not driven by the 1st Respondent and it did not involve in the accident. 17.Further the 2nd Respondent would contend that on the day of the accident the deceased was under intoxication at the time of the accident. However on perusal of the death certificate Ex.P2 there is no adverse remarks find place and hence absolutely there is no evidence to prove the said contention. 18.Further in support of their case the 2nd Respondent marked Ex.R1 and Ex.R2 the deposition given before the Ld Judicial Magistrate Court No.VIII, Coimbatore of PW-1 and PW-2 herein. However on perusal of Ex.R2 it is evident that there is no cross examination done by the defence regarding that he did not witness the accident. Hence on perusal of Ex.R1 and Ex.R2 and having regard to the clear admission of 10 RW-1 that she only drove the vehicle on the date of the accident and her conduct of not informing the accident to anyone being in a responsible post in the Police department this court is of the considered view that the Petitioners have cogently proved the involvement of the 1st Respondent in the accident. Hence point No.1 is answered in favour of the Petitioners. POINT No.2:- Who is liable to pay compensation ? 19.The 1st respondent was rider cum owner of Ford Eco Sport Car bearing Registration No.TN 66 M 2666 involved in the accident. While this being so, 2nd respondent is its insurer at the time of said accident and as point No.1 is answered against the Respondents they both are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation. Hence point No.2 is answered accordingly. POINT No.3:- Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 20.The petitioners are Son, Daughter and father of deceased and they are the legal heirs of deceased Selvaraj and are dependents upon the earning of deceased for their livelihood. In support of it they have marked the death certificate Ex.P3 and the legal heirship certificate Ex.P4 are marked. As there is no contra evidence available as against those documents this court is of the considered view that they are the dependents of the deceased and hence point No.3 is answered accordingly. POINT No.4:- If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioner? 21.The case of the Petitioners is that the deceased was active, hale and healthy prior to the accident. He was merely 57 years old at the time of accident. But due to above said road accident and sustaining grievous multiple injuries all over the body 11 and head and due to its complications, he died in the said accident. The petitioners being are Son, Daughter and father of deceased they were totally depending upon the earning of deceased for their livelihood. They are hailing from poor family. There are no other sources of income to them neither form movable nor immovable properties. They had to borrow amount towards conduct of last rites of deceased and towards day to day expenses. 22.The petitioners are legal heirs of deceased Selvaraj and are dependents upon the earning of deceased for their livelihood. The deceased Selvaraj was working as Watchman at Water Tank, Sivanantha Colony, Coimbatore and earning a sum of Rs.8,000/- per month. Though the value of human being is precious and cannot be measured by way of monetary grant, yet for the sake of social justice and for the livelihood of petitioners in this materialistic world, he has reasonably worked out him claim of compensation under the relevant heads in sub paragraph 21 (a) of main application for a total sum of Rs.10,00,000/-. 23.The amount of compensation preferred by petition is a just, fair and reasonable one. The pathetic situation, mental shock, anguish, hardship and financial constraints of the petitioners are beyond words to explain. The deceased would have lived in good health up till the standard life span more than 10 years if not trapped in the cruel accident. Therefore the claim of petitioner is just and reasonable one. 24.Whereas the contention of the 2nd Respondent is that the petitioners are not Dependants of the deceased. The age of the deceased is denied as false. The allegation that the deceased was working as Watchman and was earning a sum of Rs.8,000/- per month is stoutly denied as false. The petitioners are strictly bound to prove the age, employment, income of the deceased and dependency of the petitioners etc., by marking documentary evidence through competent witness. 25.On perusal of the records it is evident that there is no documentary evidence to 12 show that Selvaraj was working as Watchman at Water Tank, Sivanantha Colony, Coimbatore and earning a sum of Rs.8,000/- per month hence according the dictum of the Hon'ble Apex Court notional income of the deceased is taken into consideration for awarding compensation to the Petitioners. 26.The object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or dependent of the deceased. The compensation should commensurate to the loss of dependency suffered by the legal representatives. Therefore it should be just and reasonable, proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 27.In a given case, if the claim made is so exorbitant or if the claim made is contrary to ground realities, the Tribunal may not accept the claim and may proceed to determine the possible income by resorting to some guess work, which may include the ground realities prevailing at the relevant point of time. It depends on the facts of each case. 28.However during the course of argument the Ld counsel for the 2nd Respondent would contend that on perusal of the rough sketch it is evident that it is the deceased who has violated the rules and he is the root cause of the accident and hence there is a contributory negligence on the part of the deceased also. 29.Repudiating the contention of the 2nd Respondent the Ld counsel for the Petitioner would contend that without any other corroborative evidence the rough sketch alone cannot be taken into consideration. In support of his contention the Ld counsel for the Petitioner relied upon a judgment reported in 2013 (2) TN MAC 685 (DB) in the case between Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Co. Ltd., Vs Ramya & Ors wherein it has been categorically held that in absence of corroboration 13 evidence, no conclusion can be drawn merely by placing reliance on Accident Sketch. 30.Hence based on Ex.P2 Post Mortem Certificate and Ex.P3 death certificate age of the deceased is fixed as 57. and the monthly income notionally fixed as Rs.6,000/- pm. By applying the multiplier as per the dictum lay down by the Sarala Varma case the multiplier is 9 which is proper multiplier for accessing the deceased. 31.As per the law lay down in Sarala Varma case 1/3rd of the total income is deduct for personal income. As such the calculation of loss of income is calculate as follows; Monthly salary of the deceased is Rs.6,000/- and the multiplier is 9 . Therefore, Rs.6000/- x 9 x 12 = 6,48,000/- and personal expenses 1/3rd which comes to 2,16,000/- = After deduction of the personal expenses of Rs.2,16,000/- from Rs.64,80,000/- the loss of income comes to Rs.4,32,000/- 32.The petitioners are entitled for the heads of compensation is as follows ; Sl.No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs. 4,32,000/- 2 Love and Affection Rs. 2,00,000/- 3 Funeral Expenses Rs. 15,000/- 4 Damages to clothing & Vehicle Rs. 3,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs. 6,50,000/- 33. Out of the sum of Rs.6,50,000/- the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.2,75,000/- and the 2nd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.2,75,000/- and the 3rd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.1,00,000/-. Hence Point No.4 is answered accordingly. 14 In the result, the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.6,50,000/- with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.2,75,000/- with interest; and the 2nd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.2,75,000/- with interest; and the 3rd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- with interest. After deposit, the petitioners 1 to 3 are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount with interest immediately. The court fee of Rs.5,872.50- is ordered to be paid by the Petitioners within 15 days. The Advocate fees is fixed at Rs.13,500/- to be paid by the respondents by a separate cheque.

POINT No.1:- 6.The case of the Petitioners is that on 04.06.2015 when the deceased Selvaraj was returning from his work by walk and was crossing the road on the Coimbatore , Sivnantha Colony, Tatabad, 4th street junction proceeded from West to East after completely crossed the road around 19.30 hours. At that time the 1st respondent riding her Ford Eco Sport Car bearing Registration No.TN 66 M 2666 in the same road proceeded from North to South in a rash, reckless, and negligent manner suddenly hit against the Deceased violently. Due to impact of the accident, the petitioner fell on the road and sustaining severe head injury and multiple injuries all over the body. The injured Selvaraj was immediately rushed to Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital by 108 Ambulance but the doctor on duty on examination declared them dead. The body was then sent to Mortuary where post mortem was held on 05.06.2015. 7.Further contention of the Petitioners is that the 1st respondent who was rider cum owner of Ford Eco Sport Car bearing Registration No.TN 66 M 2666 is exclusively liable for the said accident due to rash and negligent driving. Therefore, the Sub-Inspector of Police, TIW (East) PS, Coimbatore has registered a case against him for the charges u/s.279 and 304(A) IPC in Crime No.418/2015 dated 04.06.2015 and the same has to be tried by the Learned Judicial Magistrate No.VIII, Coimbatore. 7 8.Further contention of the Petitioners is that the 1st respondent who was rider cum owner of offending vehicle is exclusively liable for the said accident due to rash and negligent driving. While this being so, the 1st respondent is its rider cum owner and the Motor cycle has been indemnified with second respondent for insurance coverage as on the date of accident. Therefore, the respondents 1 and 2 are jointly, severally and vicariously liable to pay the compensation to the petitioner as claimed. 9.Whereas the contention of the 2nd Respondent is that the petition is false, frivolous, vexatious and not maintainable either in law or on the facts of the case. The insurance of the vehicle of the 1st respondent the Ford Eco Sport Car bearing Registration No.TN 66 M 2666 was covered at the material time of accident under the policy of insurance is issued by the 2nd respondent subject to the terms, conditions exceptions and limitations thereof and the confirmation of Sec.64 VB of the insurance Act 1938. 10.Further contention of the 2nd respondent is that at the outset denies the allegations that the accident took place only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st respondent. The 2nd respondent does not admit the manner of accident as narrated by the petitioner in Col. 23 of the petition to be true and genuine. It is false to state that on 04.06.2015 at about 19.30 hours the deceased Selvaraj was proceeded by walk from East to West direction on Tatabad 4th street, junction and while he completely crossed the road, the 1st respondent came there by driving her car TN 66 M 2666 from North to South direction on the same road in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and caused him death. Neither the 1st respondent nor her vehicle involved in the above said accident. It is learnt that an unknown vehicle hit the deceased and ran away. To get unlawful gain the 1st respondent and her vehicle were falsely implicated in the case. Since the involvement of the vehicle and the driver in the above accident is disputed, the petitioners are liable to prove the accident beyond any doubt. It is learnt that the deceased was under intoxication at the time of the accident. 8 11.Further contention of the 2nd respondent is that there is no pedestrian cross in the place of accident. The petitioners are put to strict proof, the place, time date and the alleged manner in which the occurrence is said to have taken place. As the 1st respondent or her vehicle were not involved in the above said accident, the Judicial Magistrate NoVIII, Coimbatore, after trial, acquitted the 1st respondent from the criminal case which was foisted against the 1st respondent by police, u/s.255(1) of Cr.P.C. on 28.01.2016. Therefore as neither the 1st respondent nor her vehicle were involved in the above said accident, neither 1st respondent nor 2nd respondent are liable to give any compensation for the death of deceased Selvaraj. 12.Further contention of the 2nd respondent is that they deny the averment that the deceased died due to the alleged injuries, which sustained by him in the above said accident. The petitioners are put to strict proof that the deceased got injuries and died due to the above accident by producing relevant medical records, finding and other evidence. 13.This court has given its anxious consideration on both sides and perused the relevant records. It is the specific case of the Petitioners that the 1st respondent was the rider cum owner of Ford Eco Sport Car bearing Registration No.TN 66 M 2666 which dashed against the deceased and caused his death. Whereas the contention of the 2nd Respondent is that neither the 1st respondent nor her vehicle involved in the above said accident. And it is learnt that an unknown vehicle hit the deceased and ran away. 14.On perusal of Ex.P1 FIR it is evident that a case is registered as against the 1st Respondent for the offence u/s.279 and 304-A IPC and based on the FIR final report is filed as against the 1st Respondent vide Ex.P5. Though proper notice was served upon the 1st Respondent she remained and was set ex-parte. And hence the allegations against the 1st Respondent is controverted. 9 15.However the Ld counsel for the 2nd Respondent examined the 1st Respondent as RW-1 in support of their case and contended that on 28.01.2016 as the 1st respondent or her vehicle were not involved in the above said accident, the Judicial Magistrate NoVIII, Coimbatore, after trial, acquitted the 1st respondent from the criminal case which was foisted against her. The order of the Ld Judicial Magistrate NoVIII, Coimbatore is marked as Ex.X1. 16.However the 1st respondent [RW-1] during the chief examination she would depose that, she only drove the offending vehicle on that fateful day. On perusal of her deposition it reveals that she has not informed about the accident to the insurance company R2. However deposed that she was acquitted for the charges levelled against her by the Ld J.M.No.VIII, Coimbatore and hence she is not responsible for the accident and the deceased alone is responsible for the accident. Though RW-3 is a Police Inspector attach to Vigilance department she has failed to inform about the accident to the concerned insurer and she also remained ex-parte. Though she deposes that the deceased died due to the accident however she failed to explain what is the contributory negligence on the part of the deceased. Therefore the evidence of RW-1 itself falsify the case of the 2nd Respondent that the vehicle Eco Sport is not driven by the 1st Respondent and it did not involve in the accident. 17.Further the 2nd Respondent would contend that on the day of the accident the deceased was under intoxication at the time of the accident. However on perusal of the death certificate Ex.P2 there is no adverse remarks find place and hence absolutely there is no evidence to prove the said contention. 18.Further in support of their case the 2nd Respondent marked Ex.R1 and Ex.R2 the deposition given before the Ld Judicial Magistrate Court No.VIII, Coimbatore of PW-1 and PW-2 herein. However on perusal of Ex.R2 it is evident that there is no cross examination done by the defence regarding that he did not witness the accident. Hence on perusal of Ex.R1 and Ex.R2 and having regard to the clear admission of 10 RW-1 that she only drove the vehicle on the date of the accident and her conduct of not informing the accident to anyone being in a responsible post in the Police department this court is of the considered view that the Petitioners have cogently proved the involvement of the 1st Respondent in the accident. Hence point No.1 is answered in favour of the Petitioners. POINT No.2:- Who is liable to pay compensation ? 19.The 1st respondent was rider cum owner of Ford Eco Sport Car bearing Registration No.TN 66 M 2666 involved in the accident. While this being so, 2nd respondent is its insurer at the time of said accident and as point No.1 is answered against the Respondents they both are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation. Hence point No.2 is answered accordingly. POINT No.3:- Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 20.The petitioners are Son, Daughter and father of deceased and they are the legal heirs of deceased Selvaraj and are dependents upon the earning of deceased for their livelihood. In support of it they have marked the death certificate Ex.P3 and the legal heirship certificate Ex.P4 are marked. As there is no contra evidence available as against those documents this court is of the considered view that they are the dependents of the deceased and hence point No.3 is answered accordingly. POINT No.4:- If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioner? 21.The case of the Petitioners is that the deceased was active, hale and healthy prior to the accident. He was merely 57 years old at the time of accident. But due to above said road accident and sustaining grievous multiple injuries all over the body 11 and head and due to its complications, he died in the said accident. The petitioners being are Son, Daughter and father of deceased they were totally depending upon the earning of deceased for their livelihood. They are hailing from poor family. There are no other sources of income to them neither form movable nor immovable properties. They had to borrow amount towards conduct of last rites of deceased and towards day to day expenses. 22.The petitioners are legal heirs of deceased Selvaraj and are dependents upon the earning of deceased for their livelihood. The deceased Selvaraj was working as Watchman at Water Tank, Sivanantha Colony, Coimbatore and earning a sum of Rs.8,000/- per month. Though the value of human being is precious and cannot be measured by way of monetary grant, yet for the sake of social justice and for the livelihood of petitioners in this materialistic world, he has reasonably worked out him claim of compensation under the relevant heads in sub paragraph 21 (a) of main application for a total sum of Rs.10,00,000/-. 23.The amount of compensation preferred by petition is a just, fair and reasonable one. The pathetic situation, mental shock, anguish, hardship and financial constraints of the petitioners are beyond words to explain. The deceased would have lived in good health up till the standard life span more than 10 years if not trapped in the cruel accident. Therefore the claim of petitioner is just and reasonable one. 24.Whereas the contention of the 2nd Respondent is that the petitioners are not Dependants of the deceased. The age of the deceased is denied as false. The allegation that the deceased was working as Watchman and was earning a sum of Rs.8,000/- per month is stoutly denied as false. The petitioners are strictly bound to prove the age, employment, income of the deceased and dependency of the petitioners etc., by marking documentary evidence through competent witness. 25.On perusal of the records it is evident that there is no documentary evidence to 12 show that Selvaraj was working as Watchman at Water Tank, Sivanantha Colony, Coimbatore and earning a sum of Rs.8,000/- per month hence according the dictum of the Hon'ble Apex Court notional income of the deceased is taken into consideration for awarding compensation to the Petitioners. 26.The object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or dependent of the deceased. The compensation should commensurate to the loss of dependency suffered by the legal representatives. Therefore it should be just and reasonable, proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 27.In a given case, if the claim made is so exorbitant or if the claim made is contrary to ground realities, the Tribunal may not accept the claim and may proceed to determine the possible income by resorting to some guess work, which may include the ground realities prevailing at the relevant point of time. It depends on the facts of each case. 28.However during the course of argument the Ld counsel for the 2nd Respondent would contend that on perusal of the rough sketch it is evident that it is the deceased who has violated the rules and he is the root cause of the accident and hence there is a contributory negligence on the part of the deceased also. 29.Repudiating the contention of the 2nd Respondent the Ld counsel for the Petitioner would contend that without any other corroborative evidence the rough sketch alone cannot be taken into consideration. In support of his contention the Ld counsel for the Petitioner relied upon a judgment reported in 2013 (2) TN MAC 685 (DB) in the case between Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Co. Ltd., Vs Ramya & Ors wherein it has been categorically held that in absence of corroboration 13 evidence, no conclusion can be drawn merely by placing reliance on Accident Sketch. 30.Hence based on Ex.P2 Post Mortem Certificate and Ex.P3 death certificate age of the deceased is fixed as 57. and the monthly income notionally fixed as Rs.6,000/- pm. By applying the multiplier as per the dictum lay down by the Sarala Varma case the multiplier is 9 which is proper multiplier for accessing the deceased. 31.As per the law lay down in Sarala Varma case 1/3rd of the total income is deduct for personal income. As such the calculation of loss of income is calculate as follows; Monthly salary of the deceased is Rs.6,000/- and the multiplier is 9 . Therefore, Rs.6000/- x 9 x 12 = 6,48,000/- and personal expenses 1/3rd which comes to 2,16,000/- = After deduction of the personal expenses of Rs.2,16,000/- from Rs.64,80,000/- the loss of income comes to Rs.4,32,000/- 32.The petitioners are entitled for the heads of compensation is as follows ; Sl.No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs. 4,32,000/- 2 Love and Affection Rs. 2,00,000/- 3 Funeral Expenses Rs. 15,000/- 4 Damages to clothing & Vehicle Rs. 3,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs. 6,50,000/- 33. Out of the sum of Rs.6,50,000/- the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.2,75,000/- and the 2nd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.2,75,000/- and the 3rd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.1,00,000/-. Hence Point No.4 is answered accordingly. 14 In the result, the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.6,50,000/- with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.2,75,000/- with interest; and the 2nd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.2,75,000/- with interest; and the 3rd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- with interest. After deposit, the petitioners 1 to 3 are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount with interest immediately. The court fee of Rs.5,872.50- is ordered to be paid by the Petitioners within 15 days. The Advocate fees is fixed at Rs.13,500/- to be paid by the respondents by a separate cheque.

Respondents The petition came up on 06-10-2017 for final hearing before me in the presence of Thiru. A. K. Rahman, Advocate for Petitioners and of Thiru. V . Gopalakrishnan, Advocate for the 2nd respondent, 1st Respondent is called absent set ex-parte on 18-01-2016 and upon perusing the relevant records and having stood over for consideration till this day this court delivered the following. ORDER The Petition is filed U/S. 166 (1) ( C ) of the MOTOR VEHICLES ACT, 1994, directing the respondents to pay s sum of Rs.10,00,000/- (Rupees ten lakh) to the petitioners towards compensation together with subsequent interest thereon; AND directing the respondents to pay the cost of the claim; AND to pass such other and further reliefs as may deem fit and proper in the circumstances of the claim and thus render justice. 2.A VERMENTS CONTANED IN THE PETITION :- i.The petitioners are the legal heirs of the deceased Mohammed Ali Jinna who died in a 2 motor vehicle accident that took place on 13-08-2015 involving a Motor cycle bearing Registration No. TN 66 M 5552. ii.On the unfortunate day of 13-08-2015 the deceased Mohammed Ali Jinna was walking on the Sathi road from west to east direction. It was 10.45 a.m on 13-08-2015 the said Mohammed Ali Jinna was nearing in front of Malabar Provisions store, opposite to CMS School, Coimbatore. At that time all at a sudden there came a motor cycle bearing registration No. TN 66 M 5552 from North to South direction in a rash and negligent manner and dashed the said Mohammed Ali Jinna. Due to which the said Mohammed Ali Jinna fell down and sustained severe head injuries. The Motor Cycle bears registration No. TN 66 M 5552. iii.Immediately after the accident the injured was taken to the nearby Siva Hospital, Ganapathy, Coimbatore and there he was given first aid treatment and shifted to Sri Ramakrishna Hospital, Coimbatore and again shifted to Coimbatore Medical College Hospital, Coimbatore and admitted as in-patient. There he was given full treatment and even after best treatment he was succumbed to his injuries on the same day at about 3.15 p.m. The death was informed to the concerned authorities. The Post Mortem was conducted and the body was handed over to the petitioners to perform the last rites. The post mortem certificate revealed the cause of death due to the multiple injuries. iv.But for the rash and negligent driving of the Motor cycle bearing Registration No. TN 66 M 5552 by its driver, the accident would not have taken place. The Traffic Investigation Wing (East) police have registered a case in Cr. No. 592/2015 under section 279, 338 IPC @ 279, 304 (A) IPC and arrested the driver of the said motor cycle for causing the accident and are investigating upon. v.Before the accident the deceased Mohammed Ali Jinna was working as a Manager cum Accountant of Sri Selvi Paper Mills Private Limited, Palathurai, Madukkarai and was earning Rs.20,000/- per month and maintaining himself and supporting the petitioners very much. At the time of accident the deceased was aged about 72 years and was hale and 3 healthy. Due to the unexpected sudden death of Mohammed Ali Jinna the petitioners are terribly shocked and their day to day life structure itself is paralyzed. But for the accident he would have lived for another 10 years. His sudden and tragic demise has left a void that can never be filled as the first petitioner has lost all the caring and sharing that can be only given by her husband. The 2nd petitioner is the daughter and the 3rd petitioner is son of the deceased. In long and short the untimely death of the deceased has taken the entire wind out of their sail and is going to be an impediment to them. The petitioners are yet to relieve from the shock. vi.The first respondent is the driver cum owner of the Motor cycle bearing its Registration No. TN 66 M 5552 at the time and date of accident. The 2nd respondent is the indemnifier under whom the said vehicle has been insured at the time of accident. Therefore both these respondents are jointly severally and liable to pay compensation as claimed. vii.The suffering and sorrows and mental agonies and hardships that are undergone by the petitioner cannot be compensated by any means of kinds, of course they are incapable of more monetary measures of calculations. However they should be compensated to the extent to which they are practically possible in this material world. 3. A VERMENTS CONTAINED IN THE COUNTER STATEMENT FILED BY THE 2 nd RESPONDENT :- i.This respondent does not admit that the insurance of Shri. S. G. Manoharan in vehicle No. TN 66 M 5552 was covered at the material time under the policy of insurance issued by the 2nd respondent subject to the terms, conditions, exceptions and limitations thereof and the confirmation of the compliance of Sec. 64 VB of the Insurance Act, 1938. The insurance policy issued if any by the 2nd respondent in favour of the 1st respondent would be in the possession of the 1st respondent. The 1st respondent may kindly be directed to produce the original insurance policy before the Hon'ble Tribunal, failing which, the 2nd respondent is not liable to pay any compensation to the petitioner. If the 2nd respondent 4 found that the policy of insurance is issued then the 2nd respondent shall produce the policy of insurance. ii.The driver of the vehicle bearing Registration No. TN 66 M 5552 was not holding a valid and effective driving license at the time of the accident. Hence the 2nd respondent is not liable to pay compensation to the claimants. iii.The 2nd respondent seeks protection under the section 147 and 149 of M.V . Act. iv.As per section 134 © of M.V Act 1988, it mandatory duty of the insured/respondent No. 1 herein to furnish the particulars of policy, date, time and place of accident, particulars of insured and the name of the driver and particulars of the driving license but the insured/respondent No. 1 herein has not complied with the statutory demand. Hence the 2nd respondent is not liable to pay any compensation and the case is liable to be dismissed against the 2nd respondent for non-compliance of statutory demand by the respondent No. 1. v. As per section 158 ( C ) of M.V . Act, 1988, it is a mandatory duty of the concerned Police Station to forward all the relevant documents to the concerned insurer within 30 days from the date of the information but the concerned police station failed to forward the documents and not complied with the statutory demand. Hence this Hon'ble tribunal has to pass suitable orders against the erring officials for the non-compliance and for its consequences. vi.The petitioner is put to strict proof that the registered owner used the vehicle bearing No. TN 66 M 5552 without any breach of traffic rules. The petitioner is put to strict proof that there was no violation of any section of M.V . Act, 1988 and its subsequent amendments. vii.The petitioners are not entitled to claim any interest on non-pecuniary damages as per the observations of the judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court. viii. The 2nd respondent does not admit and denies the allegation that the vehicle bearing No. TN 66 M 5552 was involved in the above alleged accident and it was driven in a rash 5 and negligent manner and the petitioner is put to strict proof of the same. ix.The 2nd respondent does not admit and denies the allegations regarding the manner in which the alleged accident said to have occurred. The 1st respondent is not negligent and the allegation is purely with a view to get unlawful compensation. The deceased negligently and suddenly crossed the road, without noticing the traffic and invited the accident. x.The 2nd respondent is not aware and denies that the deceased Mohammed Ali Jinna was aged about 72 years and used to earn a sum of Rs.20,000/- per month as a Manager cum Accountant. Hence the petitioners are put to strict proof with documentary evidence regarding the deceased age, income, and occupation. The petitioner had given the false information regarding age, income and occupation of the deceased for the purpose of getting higher compensation. The petitioners are not depending on the deceased at the time of accident. Hence the claim is liable to be dismissed. xi.The petitioner, 1st respondent and others are colluding with an unlawful intension and have filed the above claim against this respondent to get unlawful compensation. xii.The 2nd respondent does not admit and denies that the TIW Coimbatore Police Station registered a case in Cr. No. 592/2015 u/s 279, 338, 304 (A) IPC against the 1st respondent. Hence the petitioners are put to strict proof of the same with documentary evidence. xiii.The 2nd respondent craves leave of this Hon'ble Court to take all defenses available to the respondent No. 1 under section 170 of M.V . Act and contest the case on all the grounds apart from those specified u/s 149 (2) of M.V . Act. xiv.The 2nd respondent craves the leave of this Hon'ble Court to file an additional counter at a later stage as and when the better particulars come to its knowledge. xv.Without prejudice to the above contentions, the amount of Rs.10,00,000/- with interest and costs claimed by the petitioner under different heads in the petition is more 6 excessive exorbitant and exaggerated and the petitioner is not entitled for the same from the 2nd respondent. Hence this petition has to be dismissed. 4.Though summon was served to the 1st respondent he remained absent and set ex- parte on 18-01-2016. 5. POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle bearing Registration No.TN 66 M 552 on 13-08 -2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation ? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 4. If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 6.On behalf of the petitioners, the 3rd petitioner was examined as PW-1 and one Rajesh Khanna was examined as PW-2, and 16 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P16. On behalf of the 2nd Respondent, no witnesses were examined and no document was marked. POINT No.1 :- Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle bearing Registration No.TN 66 M 552 on 13-08 -2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 7.The case of the petitioner is that 13-08-2015 the deceased Mohammed Ali Jinna was walking on the Sakthi Main road from West to East direction at about 10.45 a.m. when he was proceeding Malabar Provisions store situated opposite to CMS School, Coimbatore all of sudden the motor cycle bearing registration No. TN 66 M 5552 driven by the 1st respondent from North to South direction came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the said Mohammed Ali Jinna due to which he fell down and sustained severe head injuries. 8.Further case of the petitioner is that immediately the injured was shifted to nearby 7 Siva Hospital, Ganapathy, Coimbatore for first aid and thereafter he was shifted to Sri Ramakrishna Hospital, Coimbatore. Further once again he was shifted to Coimbatore Medical College Hospital and he was admitted as inpatient. Without responding to the treatment the said Mohammed Ali Jinna succumbed to the injuries sustained by him. Post Mortem was conducted and the body was handed over to the petitioner to perform his lost rites. 9.Further case of the petitioner is that but for the rash and negligent driving of the motor cycle bearing registration No. TN 66 M 5552 driven by the 1st respondent the accident would not have taken place. Hence the concerned Police has registered a case as against his for offenses under section 279, 338 and 304 (A) I.P.C. in Cr. No.592/15. 10.However the case of the 2nd respondent is that, the 1st respondent/driver of the vehicle bearing registration TN 66 M 5552 was not holding a valid and effective driving license at the time of accident. The 2nd respondent would further contend that as per Sec. 134 ( C ) of M.C. Act 1988 it is mandatory duty of the 1st respondent to furnish the particulars of policy date, time and place of accident, particulars of insured and the name of the driver and license. However the 1st respondent has not complied with the statutory demand as stated above. Therefore the 2nd respondent is not liable to pay compensation and the petition as against R2 is to be dismissed for non compliance of statutory demand by the 1st respondent. 11.Further contention of the 2nd t respondent is that as per Sec. 158 (6) of M.V . Act 1988 it is mandatory duty of the concerned police station to forward all the relevant documents to the concerned insurer within 30 days from the date of information. However this statutory requirement is also not complied with. 12.Further the contention of the 2nd respondent is that the petitioner is put to strict proof that the vehicle bearing registration No. TN 66 M 5552 was involved in the above alleged accident and it was driven in a rash and negligent manner. The 2nd respondent would further contend that it is denied the allegations regarding the manner in which the alleged accident 8 said to have occurred and the 1st respondent is not negligent it is the deceased who negligently all of sudden attempted to cross the road without noticing the traffic and met with the accident. 13.The 1st respondent remained absent and set ex-parte on 18-01-2016. 14.This Court has given its anxious consideration on the rival contentions of the parties to the petition. On perusal it reveals that the 1st respondent has driven the vehicle bearing registration NO. TN 66 M 5552 on 13-08-2015 and caused the accident due to which the deceased sustained grievous head injuries and died subsequently. Though the 2nd respondent would contend that the deceased alone is responsible for the accident it was not established by the 2nd respondent. Whereas on perusal of Ex. P1 F.I.R. dated 13-08-2015 it reveals that a complaint is lodged as against the 1st respondent for the offenses u/s 277 and 338 IPC and on perusal of Ex.P2 and Ex.P5 it appears that a Alteration and Final report is filed by the concerned police as against the 1st respondent for the offenses u/s 279 and 304 (A) I.P.C. 15.Further as stated already though the 2nd respondent would contend that there is no fault on the 1st respondent contra to their own statement they would contend that the 1st respondent was not in possession of valid and effective driving license at the time of accident. However it was not elucidated though oral and documentary evidence and the 1st respondent is also renamed called absent set ex-parte. 16.Further on perusal of the evidence or PW1 it reveals that during the time of accident PW1 was with deceased and who admitted him at Siva Hospital and later shifted the injured to Ramakrishna Hospital and to Government Hospital, Coimbatore. He would depose that while he and his father were crossing the road the vehicle driven by the 1st respondent came in a rash and negligent manned and dashed against the father deceased. 17.Therefore taking into consideration of the material papers on hand and having regard to the deposition of PW1 who is the eye witness to the accident this court is of the 9 considered view the 1st respondent is alone has driven the vehicle bearing registration NO. TN 66 M 5552 in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and caused his death. As the petitioners have prima facie established that the 1st respondent alone is responsible for the accident and having the 2nd respondent failed to prove the contributory negligence on the part of the deceased this court holds that the 1st respondent alone is responsible for the accident. Hence Point NO. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent. POINT NO. 2 : Who is liable to pay compensation? 18.It is admitted fact that the 1st respondent is the owner cum driver of the offending vehicle bearing registration No. TN 66 M 5552 and the 2nd respondent is the insurer of the offending vehicle under a comprehensive policy scheme. Further as Point No. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent both the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. Hence Point No. 2 is answered accordingly. POINT No. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioner? 19.The case of the petitioners is that at the time of accident Mohammed Ali Jinna was working as Manager cum Accountant Sri Selvi Paper Mills Private Limited , Palathurai, Madhukarai and was earning a sum of Rs.20,000/- per month and maintaining himself and supporting the petitioners. Further contention of the petitioners is that at the time of accident the deceased was aged about 72 years and was hale and healthy. Due to the unexpected sudden death of Mohammed Ali Jinnah the petitioners are terribly shocked and their day to day life structure itself is paralyzed. But for the accident he would have lived for another 10 years. His sudden and tragic demise has left a void that can never be filled as the 1st petitioner has lost all the carrying and sharing that can be given only by her husband. Further the 2nd petitioner and the 3rd petitioner have lost their lovable father. 10 20.Further they would contend that the sufferings and sorrows, mental agonies and hardships that are undergone by the petitioners cannot be compensated by any means or kinds. Of course, such things are also incapable of mere monetary measures of calculations. However, they should be compensated to the extent to which they are practically possible in this material world, by taking into account all the governing factors in life parlance. 21.Per contra the contention of the 2nd respondent is that they are not aware and denies that the deceased Mohammed Ali Jinna was aged about 72 years and used to earn a sum of Rs.20,000/- per month as a Manager cum Accountant. Hence the petitioners are put to strict proof with documentary evidence regarding the deceased age, income, and occupation. The petitioner had given the false information regarding age, income and occupation of the deceased for the purpose of getting higher compensation. The petitioners are not depending on the deceased at the time of accident. Hence the claim is liable to be dismissed. 22.Further they would contend that the petitioners, 1st respondent and others are colluding with an unlawful intension and have filed the above claim against this respondent to get unlawful compensation. 23.Further they would contend that without prejudice to the above contentions, the amount of Rs.10,00,000/- with interest and costs claimed by the petitioner under different heads in the petition is more excessive exorbitant and exaggerated and the petitioner is not entitled for the same from the 2nd respondent. Hence this petition has to be dismissed. 24.with the available materials in hand it is to be decided what is the quantum of compensation payable to the Petitioners. In respect of quantum of compensation is concerned it is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation which should bear in mind that the object of providing of compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been passed to legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim of the petitioners is for the monetary injury inflicted upon them and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore it should 11 be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 25.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may produced to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 26.Now coming to the case in hand the case of the petitioner is that the age of the deceased at the time of accident is 72. On perusal of Ex.P6 also the same age is reflected and in the Post Mortem Report the Doctor has opined that the deceased would appear to have died of head injury and its complications. Whereas on perusal of Ex.P7 death certificate the age of the deceased is stated as 70. However taking into consideration of the contentions of the petitioner and the age mentioned in the Post Mortem Certificate and as there is no contra evidence available in respect of the age of the deceased this Court holds that the age of the deceased is 72. 27.Now coming to the monthly income of the deceased the case of the petitioners is that at the time of accident the deceased was working as Manager cum Accountant at Sri Selvi Paper Mills Private Limited functioning at S.F. No. 41/10, Palathurai Village, Madhukkarai Post, Coimbatore 105 and he was earning a sum of Rs.20,000/- per month. In support of their claim they have also examined PW2 on summon who is the Manager of the above said Sri Selvi Paper Mills Private Limited. On perusal of the deposition of PW2 he would deposed that the deceased was getting a sum of Rs.8,000/- through cheque and a sum of Rs.12,000/- from cash and in support of his deposition he also marked Ex.P15 & P16 with objection of R2. 28.On perusal of the material placed before this Court though the petitioners and PW2 would contend that the deceased who is aged about 72 was working at Sri Selvi Paper Mills Private Limited, except Ex.P15 and P16 no other documents like appointment order, attendance register or wages register produced before this Court. 12 29.Therefore, taking into consideration of the age of the deceased this Court holds a sum of Rs.6,500/- as monthly income of the deceased. As the deceased is aged about 72, future prospects will not arise. 30.Taking into consideration of the age of the deceased and the guideline of the Hon'ble Supreme Court the appropriate multiplier would be 5 and as there are three dependents the 1/3rd of the monthly income of the deceased is taken for personal expenditure of the deceased. 31.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as t he income of the de - ceased is Rs. Rs.6,500/-. Hence Rs. Rs.6,500 x 5 x 12 = Rs.3,90,000/- and 1/3rd personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.1,30,000/-. And the Loss of Income of the de - ceased comes to [Rs. 3,90,000/- – Rs.1,30,000/-] is Rs.2,60,000/- 32.Now coming into the aspect of awarding compensation under the head consortium the Hon'ble Supreme Court had held that the wife is entitled for consortium to the extent of Rs.1,00,000/- and the Hon'ble Supreme Court in 2013 ACJ 1403 Rajesh and Others V Rajbir Singh in Para 20 held as follows: “20. We may therefore, revisit the practice of awarding compensation under conven - tional heads, Loss of Consortium to the spouse, Loss of Love, care and guidance to children and Funeral Expenses. It may be noted that the sum of Rs.2,500/- to Rs.10,000/- in those heads was fixed several decades ago and having regard to inflation factor, the some needs to be increased. In Sarla Varma's case (supra), it was held that Compensation for Loss of Consortium should be in the range of Rs.5,000/- to Rs.10,000/- In legal parlance, 'consor - tium' is the right of the spouse to the Company, care, help, comfort, guidance, society, so - lace, affection and sexual relations with his or her mate. That non-pecuniary head of dam - ages has not been properly understood by our Courts. The Loss of Companionship, Love, Care and Protection, etc., the spouse is entitled to get, has to be compensated appropriately. The Concept of Non-Pecuniary Damage for Loss of Consortium' is one of the major head of award of Compensation in other parts of the world more particularly in the United States of 13 America, Australia, etc., English Courts have also recognized the right of a spouse to get Compensation even during the period of temporary disablement. By Loss of Consortium, the Courts have made an attempt to compensate the loss of spouse's affection, comfort, so - lace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations during the future years. Unlike the Compensation awarded in other countries and other jurisdictions, since the Legal Heirs are otherwise adequately compensated for the Pecuniary Loss, it would not be proper to award a major amount under the head. Hence, we are of the view that it would only be just and reasonable that the Courts award at least rupees one lakh for Loss of Consortium”. 33.By following the above judgment, in the present case, considering the age of the de - ceased, this court holds that the 1st Petitioner is the wife of the deceased and considering her age she is entitled to a sum of Rs.50,000/- towards loss of consortium, further the petition - ers are entitled to a sum of Rs.25,000/- towards funeral expenses, further the petitioners are entitled to a sum of Rs.1,000/- towards clothing and articles, further the petitioners are enti - tled to a sum of Rs.5,000/- towards transport expenses, and Therefore, in total, the petition - ers are entitled to a sum of Rs.3,41,000/-towards compensation as listed below; Sl.No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs. 2,60,000/- 2 Loss of Consortium (1st petitioner) Rs. 50,000/- 3 Funeral Expenses Rs. 25,000/- 4 Clothing and Articles Rs. 1,000/- 6 Transport Expenses Rs. 5,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs. 3,41,000/- 34. From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.3,41,000/- towards compensation and the Respondents are 14 jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the Petitioners. And out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.2,41,000/- of claim amount and the 2nd and 3rd petitioners are entitled for Rs.50,000/- each of claim amount. Hence, the Point No.3 & 4 are answered accordingly. In the result, the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs..3,41,000/-with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. And out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.2,41,000/- of claim amount and the 2nd and 3rd petitioners are entitled for Rs.50,000/- each of claim amount. After deposit, the petitioners are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount with interest immediately. The court fee of Rs.2,782.50- is ordered to be paid by the Petitioners within 15 days.

Mariyammal was riding as a pillion rider with her sister's husband P. Masanamuthu in his Motor cycle bearing Registration No. TN 37 AE-2138 and her daughter one Vishnupriya and her sister Subbulakshmi were pillion riders.

The said Mariyammal has sustained severe head injuries and died on the spot itself. Immediately she was taken to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital and the Doctors who examined her confirmed her death. The same was informed to concerned authorities and Post-mortem was conducted. 11.Further case of the petitioner is that the said accident took place only due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent herein. The Traffic Investigation Wing (East) Police, Coimbatore has registered a First Information Report against the 1st Respondent for the offense of rash and negligent driving in their Crime No. 290/2014 dated 19-07-2014 u/s 279, 338 & 304(A) of IPC. 12.Further case of the petitioner is that at the time of accident, the 1st respondent herein was the driver and the 2nd respondent was the registered owner of the offending bus bearing Registration No. TN-33-N-2588 which caused the said accident. But for the 1st Respondent's rash and negligent driving of the said offending Bus, the said accident would not have taken place. There was no negligence on part of P. Masanamuthu. 13.Per contra the case of the 2nd respondent is that there is no negligence on the part of the 1st respondent who drove the bus bearing registration No. TN 33 N 2588 following the trafic rules and hence the respondents are not liable to compensate the petitioners. Further they would contend that as there is no fault on the part of the 1st respondent he is contesting the case lodged against him for the offences under 279,338, 304(A) IPC. 14.This Court has given it's anxious consideration on the rival contention of both parties. On perusal of Ex.P1 it reveals that on 19-07-2014 FIR is registered as against the 1st respondent for the offences under 279, 338, 304(A) IPC and vide Ex.P2 dated 6-09-2014 Final Report is filed as against R1 and ExP3 is the rough sketch showing the accident occurred near Shri. Nayagi Automobiles, Chinniampalayam and Ex.P4 is the M.V . Report in respect of the two wheeler driven by PW2 in which the deceased was a pillion rider,and 10 Ex.P5 is the M.V . Report in respect of bus belongs to 2nd respondent driven by 1st respondent and Ex.P6 is the Post Mortem Report of deceased Mariammal in which it has stated that the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries and no adverse remark has been stated, and Ex.P7 is the death certificate of Mariammal. 15.In support of the case the petitioners have examined the rider of two wheeler in which deceased Mariammal was riding as a pillion rider. On perusal of deposition of PW2 he would categorically depose that the bus driven by 1st respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the vehicle driven by him. Further he would depose that when they were proceeding in the road the offending bus without honking and making any indication attempted to over take them due to which it hit the two wheeler driven by him due to which they all fell down. Corroborating the evidence of PW2, Ex.P5 MV .I. Report in respect of the offending bus reveals that a paint scratch marks near rare left door steps. 16.Further though notice was duly served upon the 1st respondent who is the driver of the offending bus he reamined absent and he was set ex-parte on 22-12-2015. R1 is the right person who could speak about the manner of accident however remained absent. 17.Therefore taking into consideration of the evidence of PW2 and the available materials in hand this court is of the considered view that the petitioners have prima facie established that it is the 1st respondent who has driven the vehicle in a rash and the negligent manner and without making any sound and indication attempted to over take the vehicle driven by R1 and hit against it due to which all of them where thrown away and sustained injuries and due to which the deceased also died. Hence as prema facie materials are available as against R1 this court of the considered view that R1 alone drove the offending bus in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. Hence Point No. 1 is answered accordingly. POINT NO.2: Who is liable to pay compensation? 11 18.As point No.1 is answered against the 1st Respondent he as the driver of the offending vehicle, the 2nd Respondent the owner of the offending vehicle are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the Petitioners. Hence point No.2 is answered accordingly. POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 19.At the time of accident, the deceased was aged about 28 years, hale, healthy young woman, working as a Labour in a Banian Company, Tiruppur and was earning Rs.15,000/- per month. The 1st petitioner is the husband of the deceased aged about 30 years, lost his beloved wife and her caring and sharing that can be given only by his wife. The 2nd petitioner is the only daughter of the deceased, is just aged 4 years has lost her beloved mother and her love and affection at her tender age. The 1st petitioner has to look after his minor daughter in future. Due to the permanent absence of the deceased Mariyammal, the house of the petitioners looks deserted. Both the petitioners were the dependents of the income of the deceased. Their entire present and future are put into darkness and gloomy. 20.Though the petitioners would contend that the deceased was working as a labour in a Banian Company Tirupur and was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- p.m. absolutely there is no evidence adduced by the petitioners in order to prove the same. Therefore as per the rules laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.6,000/- is taken as notional income of the deceased. 21.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives are the dependence of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it 12 should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 22.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may produced to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Accordingly depending upon the facts and circumstances of this case the income of the deceased is fixed as Rs.6,000/- p.m., and as already discussed age of the deceased is fixed as 28. Considering the age of the deceased 40% of the income is taken as future prospects which comes to Rs.2,400/- in total income Rs.8,400/- In respect of the age there is no dispute and there is no contra evidence available age of the deceased is fixed as 28. As per Sharla Varma case multiplier is 17. as there are four dependents the appropriate deduction for personal expenses is 1/3 . 23.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as th income of the deceased is Rs.8,400/-. Hence Rs.8,400 X 12 X 17 = Rs.17,13,600/- and 1/3rd personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.5,71,200/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs.17,13,600 – 5,71.200 = Rs.11,42,400/-. 24.As per the latest Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court for loss of estate the petitioners are entitled for a sum of Rs.15,000/- and the 1st petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.40,000/- by way of consortium and all the petitioners for a sum of Rs.15,000/- for funeral expenses. 25.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.11,42,400/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs.15,000/- 3 Loss of consortium Rs.40,000/- 4 Funeral Expenses Rs.15,000/- 13 TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.12,12,400/- 26. From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.12,12,400/- -towards compensation and the Respondent is liable to pay a sum of Rs.12,12,400/- with interest . 27. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.3,12,400/-of claim amount and the 2nd minor petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs. 9,00,000/- of claim amount.

The said Mariyammal has sustained severe head injuries and died on the spot itself. Immediately she was taken to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital and the Doctors who examined her confirmed her death. The same was informed to concerned authorities and Post-mortem was conducted. 11.Further case of the petitioner is that the said accident took place only due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent herein. The Traffic Investigation Wing (East) Police, Coimbatore has registered a First Information Report against the 1st Respondent for the offense of rash and negligent driving in their Crime No. 290/2014 dated 19-07-2014 u/s 279, 338 & 304(A) of IPC. 12.Further case of the petitioner is that at the time of accident, the 1st respondent herein was the driver and the 2nd respondent was the registered owner of the offending bus bearing Registration No. TN-33-N-2588 which caused the said accident. But for the 1st Respondent's rash and negligent driving of the said offending Bus, the said accident would not have taken place. There was no negligence on part of P. Masanamuthu. 13.Per contra the case of the 2nd respondent is that there is no negligence on the part of the 1st respondent who drove the bus bearing registration No. TN 33 N 2588 following the trafic rules and hence the respondents are not liable to compensate the petitioners. Further they would contend that as there is no fault on the part of the 1st respondent he is contesting the case lodged against him for the offences under 279,338, 304(A) IPC. 14.This Court has given it's anxious consideration on the rival contention of both parties. On perusal of Ex.P1 it reveals that on 19-07-2014 FIR is registered as against the 1st respondent for the offences under 279, 338, 304(A) IPC and vide Ex.P2 dated 6-09-2014 Final Report is filed as against R1 and ExP3 is the rough sketch showing the accident occurred near Shri. Nayagi Automobiles, Chinniampalayam and Ex.P4 is the M.V . Report in respect of the two wheeler driven by PW2 in which the deceased was a pillion rider,and 10 Ex.P5 is the M.V . Report in respect of bus belongs to 2nd respondent driven by 1st respondent and Ex.P6 is the Post Mortem Report of deceased Mariammal in which it has stated that the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries and no adverse remark has been stated, and Ex.P7 is the death certificate of Mariammal. 15.In support of the case the petitioners have examined the rider of two wheeler in which deceased Mariammal was riding as a pillion rider. On perusal of deposition of PW2 he would categorically depose that the bus driven by 1st respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the vehicle driven by him. Further he would depose that when they were proceeding in the road the offending bus without honking and making any indication attempted to over take them due to which it hit the two wheeler driven by him due to which they all fell down. Corroborating the evidence of PW2, Ex.P5 MV .I. Report in respect of the offending bus reveals that a paint scratch marks near rare left door steps. 16.Further though notice was duly served upon the 1st respondent who is the driver of the offending bus he reamined absent and he was set ex-parte on 22-12-2015. R1 is the right person who could speak about the manner of accident however remained absent. 17.Therefore taking into consideration of the evidence of PW2 and the available materials in hand this court is of the considered view that the petitioners have prima facie established that it is the 1st respondent who has driven the vehicle in a rash and the negligent manner and without making any sound and indication attempted to over take the vehicle driven by R1 and hit against it due to which all of them where thrown away and sustained injuries and due to which the deceased also died. Hence as prema facie materials are available as against R1 this court of the considered view that R1 alone drove the offending bus in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. Hence Point No. 1 is answered accordingly. POINT NO.2: Who is liable to pay compensation? 11 18.As point No.1 is answered against the 1st Respondent he as the driver of the offending vehicle, the 2nd Respondent the owner of the offending vehicle are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the Petitioners. Hence point No.2 is answered accordingly. POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 19.At the time of accident, the deceased was aged about 28 years, hale, healthy young woman, working as a Labour in a Banian Company, Tiruppur and was earning Rs.15,000/- per month. The 1st petitioner is the husband of the deceased aged about 30 years, lost his beloved wife and her caring and sharing that can be given only by his wife. The 2nd petitioner is the only daughter of the deceased, is just aged 4 years has lost her beloved mother and her love and affection at her tender age. The 1st petitioner has to look after his minor daughter in future. Due to the permanent absence of the deceased Mariyammal, the house of the petitioners looks deserted. Both the petitioners were the dependents of the income of the deceased. Their entire present and future are put into darkness and gloomy. 20.Though the petitioners would contend that the deceased was working as a labour in a Banian Company Tirupur and was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- p.m. absolutely there is no evidence adduced by the petitioners in order to prove the same. Therefore as per the rules laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.6,000/- is taken as notional income of the deceased. 21.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives are the dependence of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it 12 should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 22.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may produced to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Accordingly depending upon the facts and circumstances of this case the income of the deceased is fixed as Rs.6,000/- p.m., and as already discussed age of the deceased is fixed as 28. Considering the age of the deceased 40% of the income is taken as future prospects which comes to Rs.2,400/- in total income Rs.8,400/- In respect of the age there is no dispute and there is no contra evidence available age of the deceased is fixed as 28. As per Sharla Varma case multiplier is 17. as there are four dependents the appropriate deduction for personal expenses is 1/3 . 23.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as th income of the deceased is Rs.8,400/-. Hence Rs.8,400 X 12 X 17 = Rs.17,13,600/- and 1/3rd personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.5,71,200/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs.17,13,600 – 5,71.200 = Rs.11,42,400/-. 24.As per the latest Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court for loss of estate the petitioners are entitled for a sum of Rs.15,000/- and the 1st petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.40,000/- by way of consortium and all the petitioners for a sum of Rs.15,000/- for funeral expenses. 25.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.11,42,400/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs.15,000/- 3 Loss of consortium Rs.40,000/- 4 Funeral Expenses Rs.15,000/- 13 TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.12,12,400/- 26. From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.12,12,400/- -towards compensation and the Respondent is liable to pay a sum of Rs.12,12,400/- with interest . 27. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.3,12,400/-of claim amount and the 2nd minor petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs. 9,00,000/- of claim amount. Hence point Nos.3 & 4 are answered accordingly. 28. In respect of petition filed in MCOP. 470/15 is concerned the petitioner would contend that a t the time of accident, the minor petitioner N. Vishnupriya was hale and healthy just aged 4 years studying in a play school nearby her house. Due to the accident the Minor petitioner feels severe head ache, loss of concentration, diminishing power of vision, giddiness and tiredness. She is confined to bed rest need others aid even to do her day to day normal works due to the permanent disabilities arising out of the injuries. In the said accident the minor petitioner's mother also sustained grievous injuries and died on the spot itself. Now the petitioner is only looking after the minor N. Vishnupriya with great difficulty. Due to the sudden impact of the accident the entire family is suffering both physically and monetarily; However no doctor certificate is enclosed or filed before the Court. On perusal of Ex.P9 which is a photo copy of the accident register. It is stated that abbration to an extent of 2 X 2 c.m and ear and nosile bleeding and abration in parital region and fracture at occipital borne is found place on the petiitoners and the doctor has opined the nature of injury as grevious. However the percentage of incapacity are the medical condition of the petitioner is not found in any of the documents. Further on perusal of Ex.P11 it appears that after the accident the minor petitioner was admitted at Government Hospital at Coimbatore on 18-07-2014 and discharged on 24-07-2014. Therefor taking into consideration of the available materials in hand and in the absence of any doctor certificate this court is of the considered view that the minor petitioner is entitled for a total sum of Rs.50,000/-. 14 29.MCOP. 469/15: In the result, the Respondents are liable to pay a sum of Rs.12,12,400/- with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months.

Mariyammal was riding as a pillion rider with her sister's husband P. Masanamuthu in his Motor cycle bearing Registration No. TN 37 AE-2138 and her daughter one Vishnupriya and her sister Subbulakshmi were pillion riders. It was 9.00 p.m on 18-07-2014 the said motor cycle was driven by the said P. Masanamuthu on the Avinashi road near Sri Nayaki Automobiles, Chinniampalayam, Coimbatore from west to east direction very slowly. At that time a TNSTC Bus bearing its Registration No. TN 33- N – 2588 driven by the 1st respondent herein came from behind i.e., from west to east direction while overtaking the said motor cycle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the said motor cycle's right side abruptly. As a result, the rider and pillion riders were thrown out from the motor cycle and sustained grievous injuries. 9 10.Further case of the petitioner is that soon after the accident the people who gathered there rescued the said Mariyammal. The said Mariyammal has sustained severe head injuries and died on the spot itself. Immediately she was taken to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital and the Doctors who examined her confirmed her death. The same was informed to concerned authorities and Post-mortem was conducted. 11.Further case of the petitioner is that the said accident took place only due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent herein. The Traffic Investigation Wing (East) Police, Coimbatore has registered a First Information Report against the 1st Respondent for the offense of rash and negligent driving in their Crime No. 290/2014 dated 19-07-2014 u/s 279, 338 & 304(A) of IPC. 12.Further case of the petitioner is that at the time of accident, the 1st respondent herein was the driver and the 2nd respondent was the registered owner of the offending bus bearing Registration No. TN-33-N-2588 which caused the said accident. But for the 1st Respondent's rash and negligent driving of the said offending Bus, the said accident would not have taken place. There was no negligence on part of P. Masanamuthu. 13.Per contra the case of the 2nd respondent is that there is no negligence on the part of the 1st respondent who drove the bus bearing registration No. TN 33 N 2588 following the trafic rules and hence the respondents are not liable to compensate the petitioners. Further they would contend that as there is no fault on the part of the 1st respondent he is contesting the case lodged against him for the offences under 279,338, 304(A) IPC. 14.This Court has given it's anxious consideration on the rival contention of both parties. On perusal of Ex.P1 it reveals that on 19-07-2014 FIR is registered as against the 1st respondent for the offences under 279, 338, 304(A) IPC and vide Ex.P2 dated 6-09-2014 Final Report is filed as against R1 and ExP3 is the rough sketch showing the accident occurred near Shri. Nayagi Automobiles, Chinniampalayam and Ex.P4 is the M.V . Report in respect of the two wheeler driven by PW2 in which the deceased was a pillion rider,and 10 Ex.P5 is the M.V . Report in respect of bus belongs to 2nd respondent driven by 1st respondent and Ex.P6 is the Post Mortem Report of deceased Mariammal in which it has stated that the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries and no adverse remark has been stated, and Ex.P7 is the death certificate of Mariammal. 15.In support of the case the petitioners have examined the rider of two wheeler in which deceased Mariammal was riding as a pillion rider. On perusal of deposition of PW2 he would categorically depose that the bus driven by 1st respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the vehicle driven by him. Further he would depose that when they were proceeding in the road the offending bus without honking and making any indication attempted to over take them due to which it hit the two wheeler driven by him due to which they all fell down. Corroborating the evidence of PW2, Ex.P5 MV .I. Report in respect of the offending bus reveals that a paint scratch marks near rare left door steps. 16.Further though notice was duly served upon the 1st respondent who is the driver of the offending bus he reamined absent and he was set ex-parte on 22-12-2015. R1 is the right person who could speak about the manner of accident however remained absent. 17.Therefore taking into consideration of the evidence of PW2 and the available materials in hand this court is of the considered view that the petitioners have prima facie established that it is the 1st respondent who has driven the vehicle in a rash and the negligent manner and without making any sound and indication attempted to over take the vehicle driven by R1 and hit against it due to which all of them where thrown away and sustained injuries and due to which the deceased also died. Hence as prema facie materials are available as against R1 this court of the considered view that R1 alone drove the offending bus in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. Hence Point No. 1 is answered accordingly. POINT NO.2: Who is liable to pay compensation? 11 18.As point No.1 is answered against the 1st Respondent he as the driver of the offending vehicle, the 2nd Respondent the owner of the offending vehicle are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the Petitioners. Hence point No.2 is answered accordingly. POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 19.At the time of accident, the deceased was aged about 28 years, hale, healthy young woman, working as a Labour in a Banian Company, Tiruppur and was earning Rs.15,000/- per month. The 1st petitioner is the husband of the deceased aged about 30 years, lost his beloved wife and her caring and sharing that can be given only by his wife. The 2nd petitioner is the only daughter of the deceased, is just aged 4 years has lost her beloved mother and her love and affection at her tender age. The 1st petitioner has to look after his minor daughter in future. Due to the permanent absence of the deceased Mariyammal, the house of the petitioners looks deserted. Both the petitioners were the dependents of the income of the deceased. Their entire present and future are put into darkness and gloomy. 20.Though the petitioners would contend that the deceased was working as a labour in a Banian Company Tirupur and was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- p.m. absolutely there is no evidence adduced by the petitioners in order to prove the same. Therefore as per the rules laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.6,000/- is taken as notional income of the deceased. 21.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives are the dependence of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it 12 should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 22.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may produced to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Accordingly depending upon the facts and circumstances of this case the income of the deceased is fixed as Rs.6,000/- p.m., and as already discussed age of the deceased is fixed as 28. Considering the age of the deceased 40% of the income is taken as future prospects which comes to Rs.2,400/- in total income Rs.8,400/- In respect of the age there is no dispute and there is no contra evidence available age of the deceased is fixed as 28. As per Sharla Varma case multiplier is 17. as there are four dependents the appropriate deduction for personal expenses is 1/3 . 23.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as th income of the deceased is Rs.8,400/-. Hence Rs.8,400 X 12 X 17 = Rs.17,13,600/- and 1/3rd personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.5,71,200/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs.17,13,600 – 5,71.200 = Rs.11,42,400/-. 24.As per the latest Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court for loss of estate the petitioners are entitled for a sum of Rs.15,000/- and the 1st petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.40,000/- by way of consortium and all the petitioners for a sum of Rs.15,000/- for funeral expenses. 25.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.11,42,400/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs.15,000/- 3 Loss of consortium Rs.40,000/- 4 Funeral Expenses Rs.15,000/- 13 TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.12,12,400/- 26. From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.12,12,400/- -towards compensation and the Respondent is liable to pay a sum of Rs.12,12,400/- with interest . 27. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.3,12,400/-of claim amount and the 2nd minor petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs. 9,00,000/- of claim amount. Hence point Nos.3 & 4 are answered accordingly. 28. In respect of petition filed in MCOP. 470/15 is concerned the petitioner would contend that a t the time of accident, the minor petitioner N. Vishnupriya was hale and healthy just aged 4 years studying in a play school nearby her house. Due to the accident the Minor petitioner feels severe head ache, loss of concentration, diminishing power of vision, giddiness and tiredness. She is confined to bed rest need others aid even to do her day to day normal works due to the permanent disabilities arising out of the injuries. In the said accident the minor petitioner's mother also sustained grievous injuries and died on the spot itself. Now the petitioner is only looking after the minor N. Vishnupriya with great difficulty. Due to the sudden impact of the accident the entire family is suffering both physically and monetarily; However no doctor certificate is enclosed or filed before the Court. On perusal of Ex.P9 which is a photo copy of the accident register. It is stated that abbration to an extent of 2 X 2 c.m and ear and nosile bleeding and abration in parital region and fracture at occipital borne is found place on the petiitoners and the doctor has opined the nature of injury as grevious. However the percentage of incapacity are the medical condition of the petitioner is not found in any of the documents. Further on perusal of Ex.P11 it appears that after the accident the minor petitioner was admitted at Government Hospital at Coimbatore on 18-07-2014 and discharged on 24-07-2014. Therefor taking into consideration of the available materials in hand and in the absence of any doctor certificate this court is of the considered view that the minor petitioner is entitled for a total sum of Rs.50,000/-. 14 29.MCOP. 469/15: In the result, the Respondents are liable to pay a sum of Rs.12,12,400/- with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months.

The said vehicle which involved in the accident was not insured at the time of accident. Therefore, the respondent is the only liable to pay the compensation the the petitioner. 3. BRIEF A VERMENT CONTAINED IN THE COUNTER :- i.It is categorically false to aver that on 16.08.2015 at about 12.00 hrs, the deceased M.Rajagopal was riding his motor cycle HONDA SHINE bearing Registration No.TN 38 BY 2135, very slowly and carefully proceeding from south to north, at VMT Nagar junction, nearly lorry Association Oil Company, Thadagam Road, Coimbatore at that time the respondent driven by his vehicle BAJAJ scooter bearing Registration No.TN B 4405 proceeding from north to south in a rash and negligent manner without giving any signal and suddenly turned the right side of the road and dashed against the deceased M.Rajagopal's motorcycle. It is false to aver that the accident was happened due to the violation of the basic rules by the Respondent. It is false to aver that at the time of accident the deceased was aged about 23 years and he was working as lorry driver and earning monthly around Rs.9,000/- p.m. The rest of the allegations made in the petition in support of the petitioners' case are distorting one and self-explanatory. ii.On 16.08.2015 at about 01.00 P.M. the Respondent drove the scooter along with his 2 years old granddaughter, who stood in front of the scooter, on the Kovai to Thadagam road, from north to south direction at a moderate speed, cautious manner and adhering the traffic rules and regulations and nearing Lorry Association Oil Company, in order to VMT Nagar, he further reduced speed and gave indicator and proper hand signal, then swerved towards right side and almost crossed ¾ portion and 4 also reached at pirivu road. At that time, one Honda Bike, bearing Registration No.TN 38 BY 2135 came from south to north direction, driven by the deceased M.Rajagopal, in a rash and negligent manner, without adhering the traffic rules and regulations and also inebriated condition , in the result of which hit at left middle of the scooter. Due to that, the respondent and his granddaughter were thrown off to some distance about 10 feet and fell down. Due to impact this respondent became unconscious condition. iii.After a while, the respondent's son came to the scene of occurrence and the respondent and his granddaughter were brought to Ganga Hospital, Coimbatore where this respondent underwent treatment 1-1/2 months as inpatient at Intensive Care Unit due to life endanger injuries and till date this respondent has not completely cured. His granddaughter has also sustained grievous injuries at leg, hand, and head for which took treatment more than 4 months at Ganga Hospital. This respondent spent Rs.15,00,000/- towards medical expenses for himself and his granddaughter. iv.The respondent's vehicle model is 1978 and this respondent service maintained properly, thereby it is good condition at the time of accident and too, its speed is below 30 K.M. and the respondent aged about 67 years old and he took his granddaughter in front of scooter drove his scooter in dead slow. While the real fact is so, for the only one reason as rider of motorcycle, Rajagopal died, 3rd petitioner, Manikandan lodged false complaint against this respondent in order to get wrongful gain from this respondent with influence of police officials. But the deceased was drove the above said motorcycle in drunken condition and he has kept two quarter Alcohol Bottles in his motorcycles tank cover which was well known to (1)Vijayakumar, Kanuvai, (2) Shanmugam, Sanjeevi Nagar, (3) Manjula, VMT Nagar, (4) Jayakumar. VSK Nagar, (5) Arusamy, Kanuvai and (6) Karthikeyan, Pannimadai who all were at the scene of occurrence and real fact at the time of 5 accident. As this respondent and his granddaughter have sustained grievous injuries, became unconscious condition and took treatment as inpatient, taking advantage the respondent's condition. The father of the deceased, 3rd petitioner herein, has lodged false complaint to the police and suppressed the real fact and filed this frivolous petition. In fact, the accident occurred only due to rash and negligent driving with inebriated condition of deceased, thereby the deceased is alone responsible for the said accident. There is no fault on the part of the respondent. Under the above said circumstances the petitioners are not entitled to claim any compensation from the respondent and totally liable to be rejected in limini. 4. POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the respondent has drove the offending vehicle Bajaj Scooter bearing Registration No. TN B 4405 on 16.08.2015 in a rash and negligent manner ? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation ? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 5.On behalf of the petitioners, 1st petitioner was examined as PW-1 and Ex.P1 to Ex.P15 was marked. 6.As the Respondent failed to cross examine PW-1 he was called absent set ex-parte. Therefore, the arguments of the petitioners and perused the entire records. POINT No.1:- 7.The case of the petitioners is that on 16.08.2015 at about 12.00 hrs the deceased M.Rajagopal was riding his Motor cycle 'HONDA SHINE' bearing Registration No.TN 38 BY 2135 very slowly and carefully proceeding from south to north direction. When he was proceeding in the road, at VMT Nagar junction near 6 lorry Association Oil Company, Thadagam Road, Coimbatore, at that time the respondent who was riding a BAJAJ Scooter bearing Registration No. TN B 4405, proceeding from north to south in a rash and negligent manner without giving any signal and suddenly turned the right side of the road and dashed against the deceased M.Rajagopal's Motor cycle owing to that deceased fall on the road along with his motor cycle and sustained grievous head injuries and all over the body. Immediately the petitioner was taken to CMC Hospital, Coimbatore through 108 Ambulance. Where the medical officers referred with the deceased and informed that M.Rajagopal was died on the way itself. 8.Further case of the petitioners is that the above said accident was happened as the Respondent has violated the basic rule. Hence, the Thudialur Police Station has a filed a criminal case in Crime.No.416/2015 u/s.279, 334, and 304 (A) IPC against the respondent who was the driver cum owner of the said vehicle BAJAJ scooter bearing Registration No. TN B 4405 and the same is pending before the Ld Judicial Magistrate No.1, Coimbatore. 9.Further case of the petitioners is that at the time of accident, the deceased M.Rajagopal was aged about 23 years and he was working as Lorry Driver and earning monthly around Rs.9,000/- p.m. thereby the deceased M.Rajagopal, maintaining himself and his wife vis., 1st petitioner his minor daughter as 2nd petitioner, the parents 3rd and 4th petitioners. The sudden death of the deceased M.Rajagopal placed the petitioners in doll-drum and to suffer very lot both financially and mentally. Due to the death of the deceased M.Rajagopal, presently petitioners are engulfed and trapped by the burden of debts arising out of livelihood and maintaining the petitioners to answer the question of the survival. The Petitioners are just like fish out of water due to the sudden death of deceased M.Ragagoapl. 7 10.Further case of the petitioners is that the respondent is the driver cum owner of the offending vehicle BAJAJ scooter bearing Registration No.TN B 4405 at the time of accident. The said vehicle which involved in the accident was not insured at the time of accident. Therefore, the respondent is the only liable to pay the compensation the petitioner. 11.Whereas the contention of the respondent is that it is categorically false to aver that on 16.08.2015 at about 12.00 hrs, the deceased M.Rajagopal was riding his motor cycle HONDA SHINE bearing Registration No.TN 38 BY 2135, very slowly and carefully proceeding from south to north at Thadagam Road, Coimbatore. The Respondent would also contend that due to the negligence act of the deceased alone the accident took place and because of the accident he and his granddaughter sustained injuries and he was hospitalized for more than one month and spent huge amount of Rs.15,00,000/-. Further the Respondent would contend that the deceased has driven his vehicle in a drunken manner and he also carried two liquor bottles with him at the time of the accident and hence contended that the deceased alone is solely responsible for the accident. However in-order to gain money from the Respondent the 3rd Petitioner has lodge a criminal complaint against the Respondent. 12.On perusal of Ex.P1 FIR, Ex.P2 final report it is filed as against the Respondent and he was charged for the offences U/s.279, 304 (A) IPC. Likewise on perusal of Ex.P5 it is evident the vehicle of the Respondent is also not insured and no fitness certificate was produced before the vehicle Inspector. Of course with a valid license he has driven the vehicle. 13.Similarly on perusal of Ex.P4 it is evident that the vehicle in which the deceased was riding was not insured and Fitness certificate was also not produced before the Vehicle Inspector. However there is no iota of evidence to show that the deceased also contributed to the accident. Admittedly as per the MV report the 8 accident was not due to any mechanical defect of the vehicle of the deceased. 14.On perusal of Ex.P6 Post-mortem report the doctor has opined that the deceased would have died of his head injury. Apart from that no adverse remark is found place in the certificate as claimed by the Respondent. 15.Though the respondent filed his counter disputing the claim of petitioner however failed to cross examine PW-1 in respect of her claim. As there is no contra evidence available as against the claim of the Petitioners and having regard to the fact that the Petitioners have prima facie proved their claim considering the nature and circumstance of the case this court is of the considered view that the Respondent is liable to pay the compensation. 16.Now with regard to the quantum of compensation a s already stated the accident and death of the deceased are not disputed by the Respondent and no adverse remarks found in the Post Mortem certificate. Therefore as there is no contra evidence on the part of the Respondent that the deceased also contributed to the negligence the contention of the Respondent cannot be countenanced with as it is a vague and usual defence raised. 17.Further it should be bear in mind that t he object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or dependent of the deceased. The compensation should commensurate to the loss of dependency suffered by the legal representatives. Therefore it should be just and reasonable, proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 18.Though the petitioner has contended that the deceased Rajagopal has working 9 as Lorry Driver and was earning a sum of Rs.9,000/-, she has not filed any documentary proof to establish her claim. Further she is also not examined anybody in this regard. 19.However, on perusal of Ex.P4 MVI report submitted by the petitioner it appears that the deceased was in possession of the valid driving license, therefore though no document is filed to prove that he was employed as a driver and was earning Rs.9000/- p.m. at least the petitioner is able to establish the her deceased husband knew driving and was in possession of valid driving license. 20.In a given case, if the claim made is so exorbitant or if the claim made is contrary to ground realities, the Tribunal may not accept the claim and may proceed to determine the possible income by resorting to some guess work, which may include the ground realities prevailing at the relevant point of time. It depends on the facts of each case. Therefore on perusal of the entire evidence and upon the settled law this court is of the considered view that income can be guesstimated and the monthly income is fixed at Rs.3,000/-pm. 21.The sufferings and sorrows, mental agonies and hard ship that are undergone by the petitioners cannot be compensated by any means or kinds and they are incapable of mere monetary measures of calculations. However, they should be compensated to the extent to which they are practically possible in this material. On perusal of Ex.P7 death certificate the age of the deceased is mentioned that 23 years. The petitioner has marked Ex.P8 Legal Heir-ship certificate in order to prove that the petitioners are LRs of the deceased Rajagopal. Therefore upon the settled law on this point this court is of the considered view that income can be calculated and by applying the Multiplier as per the dictum laid down by the Apex court in Sarala Varma case the Multiplier is 18 which is the proper multiplier for assessing the income of the deceased. 10 22.With regard to the claim of consortium the Hono’ble Supreme Court in the case between Rajesh and Others V Rajbir Singh reported in 2013 ACJ 1403 had held that the wife is entitled for consortium to the extent of Rs.1,00,000/-. For better appreciation the relevant paragraph is reproduced below for better understanding. “20. We may therefore, revisit the practice of awarding compensation under conventional heads, Loss of Consortium to the spouse, Loss of Love, care and guidance to children and Funeral Expenses. It may be noted that the sum of Rs.2,500/- to Rs.10,000/- in those heads was fixed several decades ago and having regard to inflation factor, the some needs to be increased. In Sarla Varma's case (supra), it was held that Compensation for Loss of Consortium should be in the range of Rs.5,000/- to Rs.10,000/- In legal parlance, 'consortium' is the right of the spouse to the Company, care, help, comfort, guidance, society, solace, affection and sexual relations with his or her mate. That non-pecuniary head of damages has not been properly understood by our Courts. The Loss of Companionship, Love, Care and Protection, etc., the spouse is entitled to get, has to be compensated appropriately. The Concept of Non- Pecuniary Damage for Loss of Consortium' is one of the major head of award of Compensation in other parts of the world more particularly in the United States of America, Australia, etc., English Courts have also recognized the right of a spouse to get Compensation even during the period of temporary disablement. By Loss of Consortium, the Courts have made an attempt to compensate the loss of spouse's affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations during the future years. Unlike the Compensation awarded in other countries and other jurisdictions, since the Legal Heirs are otherwise adequately compensated for the Pecuniary Loss,it 11 would not be proper to award a major amount under the head. Hence, we are of the view that it would only be just and reasonable that the Courts award at least rupees one lakh for Loss of Consortium”. and following above judgment, in the present case, considering the age of the deceased, I hold that the 1st petitioner being the wife is entitled to a sum of Rs.1,00,000/-. 23.By applying the Multiplier as per the dictum laid down by the Apex court in Sarala Varma case the Multiplier is 18 which is the proper multiplier for assessing the income of the deceased. As per the law laid down in Sarala Varma case 1/4 of the amount is to be deducted for personal expenses. Considering the age of the deceased and in view of the dictum laid down by the apex court 1/4th of the total income is deducted for personal expenses of the deceased. As such the calculation of loss of income can be calculated as follows; Loss of income of deceased is Rs. 3,000/- and Multiplier is 18, future prospectus 1,500/- total 4,500/-and Personal expenses to be deducted is ¼. As such Rs.4,500 X 12 X 18 = Rs.9,72,000/- Rs.9,72,000 – Rs.2,43,000/- = Rs.7,29,000/- 1. Loss of Income -Rs.7,29,000/- 2. Love and Affection -Rs. 1,00,000/- 3. Loss of consortium -Rs. 1,00,000/- 4. Transportation from hospital -Rs. 1,000/- 5. Damages to clothing & articles -Rs. 2,000/- ----------------- Total -Rs.9,32,000/- ----------------- 12 24.As already held the Respondent is liable to pay the compensation as fixed above and hence Point No.1 to 3 are answered accordingly. 25.Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.3,00,000/- and the 2nd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.2,32,000/- and the 3rd and 4th Petitioners are entitled for a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- each and hence Point No.3 is answered accordingly. In the result, the Respondent is liable to pay a sum of Rs.9,32,000/- with interest to the petitioners at the rate of 6% per annum, from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with interest, and the 2nd petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.2,32,000/- with interest and the 3rd and 4th Petitioners are entitled for a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- each with interest. After deposit, the 1st petitioner is permitted to withdraw half of her share immediately and the balance Rs.1,50,000/- with interest of her share is to be deposited in any nationalized bank for three years and with regard to the share of the minor 2nd Petitioner is concerned it shall be deposited in any nationalized bank till she attains her majority and the 3rd and 4th Petitioners are permitted to withdraw their entire amount with interest. The court fee of Rs.8692.50- is ordered to be paid by the petitioners within 15 days. The Advocate fees is fixed at Rs.16,320/- to be paid by the Respondent by a separate cheque.

The said Mariyammal has sustained severe head injuries and died on the spot itself. Immediately she was taken to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital and the Doctors who examined her confirmed her death. The same was informed to concerned authorities and Post-mortem was conducted. 11.Further case of the petitioner is that the said accident took place only due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent herein. The Traffic Investigation Wing (East) Police, Coimbatore has registered a First Information Report against the 1st Respondent for the offense of rash and negligent driving in their Crime No. 290/2014 dated 19-07-2014 u/s 279, 338 & 304(A) of IPC. 12.Further case of the petitioner is that at the time of accident, the 1st respondent herein was the driver and the 2nd respondent was the registered owner of the offending bus bearing Registration No. TN-33-N-2588 which caused the said accident. But for the 1st Respondent's rash and negligent driving of the said offending Bus, the said accident would not have taken place. There was no negligence on part of P. Masanamuthu. 13.Per contra the case of the 2nd respondent is that there is no negligence on the part of the 1st respondent who drove the bus bearing registration No. TN 33 N 2588 following the trafic rules and hence the respondents are not liable to compensate the petitioners. Further they would contend that as there is no fault on the part of the 1st respondent he is contesting the case lodged against him for the offences under 279,338, 304(A) IPC. 14.This Court has given it's anxious consideration on the rival contention of both parties. On perusal of Ex.P1 it reveals that on 19-07-2014 FIR is registered as against the 1st respondent for the offences under 279, 338, 304(A) IPC and vide Ex.P2 dated 6-09-2014 Final Report is filed as against R1 and ExP3 is the rough sketch showing the accident occurred near Shri. Nayagi Automobiles, Chinniampalayam and Ex.P4 is the M.V . Report in respect of the two wheeler driven by PW2 in which the deceased was a pillion rider,and 10 Ex.P5 is the M.V . Report in respect of bus belongs to 2nd respondent driven by 1st respondent and Ex.P6 is the Post Mortem Report of deceased Mariammal in which it has stated that the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries and no adverse remark has been stated, and Ex.P7 is the death certificate of Mariammal. 15.In support of the case the petitioners have examined the rider of two wheeler in which deceased Mariammal was riding as a pillion rider. On perusal of deposition of PW2 he would categorically depose that the bus driven by 1st respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the vehicle driven by him. Further he would depose that when they were proceeding in the road the offending bus without honking and making any indication attempted to over take them due to which it hit the two wheeler driven by him due to which they all fell down. Corroborating the evidence of PW2, Ex.P5 MV .I. Report in respect of the offending bus reveals that a paint scratch marks near rare left door steps. 16.Further though notice was duly served upon the 1st respondent who is the driver of the offending bus he reamined absent and he was set ex-parte on 22-12-2015. R1 is the right person who could speak about the manner of accident however remained absent. 17.Therefore taking into consideration of the evidence of PW2 and the available materials in hand this court is of the considered view that the petitioners have prima facie established that it is the 1st respondent who has driven the vehicle in a rash and the negligent manner and without making any sound and indication attempted to over take the vehicle driven by R1 and hit against it due to which all of them where thrown away and sustained injuries and due to which the deceased also died. Hence as prema facie materials are available as against R1 this court of the considered view that R1 alone drove the offending bus in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. Hence Point No. 1 is answered accordingly. POINT NO.2: Who is liable to pay compensation? 11 18.As point No.1 is answered against the 1st Respondent he as the driver of the offending vehicle, the 2nd Respondent the owner of the offending vehicle are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the Petitioners. Hence point No.2 is answered accordingly. POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 19.At the time of accident, the deceased was aged about 28 years, hale, healthy young woman, working as a Labour in a Banian Company, Tiruppur and was earning Rs.15,000/- per month. The 1st petitioner is the husband of the deceased aged about 30 years, lost his beloved wife and her caring and sharing that can be given only by his wife. The 2nd petitioner is the only daughter of the deceased, is just aged 4 years has lost her beloved mother and her love and affection at her tender age. The 1st petitioner has to look after his minor daughter in future. Due to the permanent absence of the deceased Mariyammal, the house of the petitioners looks deserted. Both the petitioners were the dependents of the income of the deceased. Their entire present and future are put into darkness and gloomy. 20.Though the petitioners would contend that the deceased was working as a labour in a Banian Company Tirupur and was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- p.m. absolutely there is no evidence adduced by the petitioners in order to prove the same. Therefore as per the rules laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.6,000/- is taken as notional income of the deceased. 21.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives are the dependence of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it 12 should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 22.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may produced to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Accordingly depending upon the facts and circumstances of this case the income of the deceased is fixed as Rs.6,000/- p.m., and as already discussed age of the deceased is fixed as 28. Considering the age of the deceased 40% of the income is taken as future prospects which comes to Rs.2,400/- in total income Rs.8,400/- In respect of the age there is no dispute and there is no contra evidence available age of the deceased is fixed as 28. As per Sharla Varma case multiplier is 17. as there are four dependents the appropriate deduction for personal expenses is 1/3 . 23.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as th income of the deceased is Rs.8,400/-. Hence Rs.8,400 X 12 X 17 = Rs.17,13,600/- and 1/3rd personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.5,71,200/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs.17,13,600 – 5,71.200 = Rs.11,42,400/-. 24.As per the latest Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court for loss of estate the petitioners are entitled for a sum of Rs.15,000/- and the 1st petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.40,000/- by way of consortium and all the petitioners for a sum of Rs.15,000/- for funeral expenses. 25.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.11,42,400/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs.15,000/- 3 Loss of consortium Rs.40,000/- 4 Funeral Expenses Rs.15,000/- 13 TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.12,12,400/- 26. From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.12,12,400/- -towards compensation and the Respondent is liable to pay a sum of Rs.12,12,400/- with interest . 27. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.3,12,400/-of claim amount and the 2nd minor petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs. 9,00,000/- of claim amount. Hence point Nos.3 & 4 are answered accordingly. 28. In respect of petition filed in MCOP. 470/15 is concerned the petitioner would contend that a t the time of accident, the minor petitioner N. Vishnupriya was hale and healthy just aged 4 years studying in a play school nearby her house. Due to the accident the Minor petitioner feels severe head ache, loss of concentration, diminishing power of vision, giddiness and tiredness. She is confined to bed rest need others aid even to do her day to day normal works due to the permanent disabilities arising out of the injuries. In the said accident the minor petitioner's mother also sustained grievous injuries and died on the spot itself. Now the petitioner is only looking after the minor N. Vishnupriya with great difficulty. Due to the sudden impact of the accident the entire family is suffering both physically and monetarily; However no doctor certificate is enclosed or filed before the Court. On perusal of Ex.P9 which is a photo copy of the accident register. It is stated that abbration to an extent of 2 X 2 c.m and ear and nosile bleeding and abration in parital region and fracture at occipital borne is found place on the petiitoners and the doctor has opined the nature of injury as grevious. However the percentage of incapacity are the medical condition of the petitioner is not found in any of the documents.

Mariyammal was riding as a pillion rider with her sister's husband P. Masanamuthu in his Motor cycle bearing Registration No. TN 37 AE-2138 and her daughter one Vishnupriya and her sister Subbulakshmi were pillion riders. It was 9.00 p.m on 18-07-2014 the said motor cycle was driven by the said P. Masanamuthu on the Avinashi road near Sri Nayaki Automobiles, Chinniampalayam, Coimbatore from west to east direction very slowly. At that time a TNSTC Bus bearing its Registration No. TN 33- N – 2588 driven by the 1st respondent herein came from behind i.e., from west to east direction while overtaking the said motor cycle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the said motor cycle's right side abruptly. As a result, the rider and pillion riders were thrown out from the motor cycle and sustained grievous injuries. 9 10.Further case of the petitioner is that soon after the accident the people who gathered there rescued the said Mariyammal. The said Mariyammal has sustained severe head injuries and died on the spot itself. Immediately she was taken to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital and the Doctors who examined her confirmed her death. The same was informed to concerned authorities and Post-mortem was conducted. 11.Further case of the petitioner is that the said accident took place only due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent herein. The Traffic Investigation Wing (East) Police, Coimbatore has registered a First Information Report against the 1st Respondent for the offense of rash and negligent driving in their Crime No. 290/2014 dated 19-07-2014 u/s 279, 338 & 304(A) of IPC. 12.Further case of the petitioner is that at the time of accident, the 1st respondent herein was the driver and the 2nd respondent was the registered owner of the offending bus bearing Registration No. TN-33-N-2588 which caused the said accident. But for the 1st Respondent's rash and negligent driving of the said offending Bus, the said accident would not have taken place. There was no negligence on part of P. Masanamuthu. 13.Per contra the case of the 2nd respondent is that there is no negligence on the part of the 1st respondent who drove the bus bearing registration No. TN 33 N 2588 following the trafic rules and hence the respondents are not liable to compensate the petitioners. Further they would contend that as there is no fault on the part of the 1st respondent he is contesting the case lodged against him for the offences under 279,338, 304(A) IPC. 14.This Court has given it's anxious consideration on the rival contention of both parties. On perusal of Ex.P1 it reveals that on 19-07-2014 FIR is registered as against the 1st respondent for the offences under 279, 338, 304(A) IPC and vide Ex.P2 dated 6-09-2014 Final Report is filed as against R1 and ExP3 is the rough sketch showing the accident occurred near Shri. Nayagi Automobiles, Chinniampalayam and Ex.P4 is the M.V . Report in respect of the two wheeler driven by PW2 in which the deceased was a pillion rider,and 10 Ex.P5 is the M.V . Report in respect of bus belongs to 2nd respondent driven by 1st respondent and Ex.P6 is the Post Mortem Report of deceased Mariammal in which it has stated that the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries and no adverse remark has been stated, and Ex.P7 is the death certificate of Mariammal. 15.In support of the case the petitioners have examined the rider of two wheeler in which deceased Mariammal was riding as a pillion rider. On perusal of deposition of PW2 he would categorically depose that the bus driven by 1st respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the vehicle driven by him. Further he would depose that when they were proceeding in the road the offending bus without honking and making any indication attempted to over take them due to which it hit the two wheeler driven by him due to which they all fell down. Corroborating the evidence of PW2, Ex.P5 MV .I. Report in respect of the offending bus reveals that a paint scratch marks near rare left door steps. 16.Further though notice was duly served upon the 1st respondent who is the driver of the offending bus he reamined absent and he was set ex-parte on 22-12-2015. R1 is the right person who could speak about the manner of accident however remained absent. 17.Therefore taking into consideration of the evidence of PW2 and the available materials in hand this court is of the considered view that the petitioners have prima facie established that it is the 1st respondent who has driven the vehicle in a rash and the negligent manner and without making any sound and indication attempted to over take the vehicle driven by R1 and hit against it due to which all of them where thrown away and sustained injuries and due to which the deceased also died. Hence as prema facie materials are available as against R1 this court of the considered view that R1 alone drove the offending bus in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. Hence Point No. 1 is answered accordingly. POINT NO.2: Who is liable to pay compensation? 11 18.As point No.1 is answered against the 1st Respondent he as the driver of the offending vehicle, the 2nd Respondent the owner of the offending vehicle are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the Petitioners. Hence point No.2 is answered accordingly. POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 19.At the time of accident, the deceased was aged about 28 years, hale, healthy young woman, working as a Labour in a Banian Company, Tiruppur and was earning Rs.15,000/- per month. The 1st petitioner is the husband of the deceased aged about 30 years, lost his beloved wife and her caring and sharing that can be given only by his wife. The 2nd petitioner is the only daughter of the deceased, is just aged 4 years has lost her beloved mother and her love and affection at her tender age. The 1st petitioner has to look after his minor daughter in future. Due to the permanent absence of the deceased Mariyammal, the house of the petitioners looks deserted. Both the petitioners were the dependents of the income of the deceased. Their entire present and future are put into darkness and gloomy. 20.Though the petitioners would contend that the deceased was working as a labour in a Banian Company Tirupur and was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- p.m. absolutely there is no evidence adduced by the petitioners in order to prove the same. Therefore as per the rules laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.6,000/- is taken as notional income of the deceased. 21.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives are the dependence of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it 12 should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 22.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may produced to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Accordingly depending upon the facts and circumstances of this case the income of the deceased is fixed as Rs.6,000/- p.m., and as already discussed age of the deceased is fixed as 28. Considering the age of the deceased 40% of the income is taken as future prospects which comes to Rs.2,400/- in total income Rs.8,400/- In respect of the age there is no dispute and there is no contra evidence available age of the deceased is fixed as 28. As per Sharla Varma case multiplier is 17. as there are four dependents the appropriate deduction for personal expenses is 1/3 . 23.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as th income of the deceased is Rs.8,400/-. Hence Rs.8,400 X 12 X 17 = Rs.17,13,600/- and 1/3rd personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.5,71,200/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs.17,13,600 – 5,71.200 = Rs.11,42,400/-. 24.As per the latest Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court for loss of estate the petitioners are entitled for a sum of Rs.15,000/- and the 1st petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.40,000/- by way of consortium and all the petitioners for a sum of Rs.15,000/- for funeral expenses. 25.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.11,42,400/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs.15,000/- 3 Loss of consortium Rs.40,000/- 4 Funeral Expenses Rs.15,000/- 13 TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.12,12,400/- 26. From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.12,12,400/- -towards compensation and the Respondent is liable to pay a sum of Rs.12,12,400/- with interest . 27. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.3,12,400/-of claim amount and the 2nd minor petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs. 9,00,000/- of claim amount. Hence point Nos.3 & 4 are answered accordingly. 28. In respect of petition filed in MCOP. 470/15 is concerned the petitioner would contend that a t the time of accident, the minor petitioner N. Vishnupriya was hale and healthy just aged 4 years studying in a play school nearby her house. Due to the accident the Minor petitioner feels severe head ache, loss of concentration, diminishing power of vision, giddiness and tiredness. She is confined to bed rest need others aid even to do her day to day normal works due to the permanent disabilities arising out of the injuries. In the said accident the minor petitioner's mother also sustained grievous injuries and died on the spot itself. Now the petitioner is only looking after the minor N. Vishnupriya with great difficulty. Due to the sudden impact of the accident the entire family is suffering both physically and monetarily; However no doctor certificate is enclosed or filed before the Court. On perusal of Ex.P9 which is a photo copy of the accident register. It is stated that abbration to an extent of 2 X 2 c.m and ear and nosile bleeding and abration in parital region and fracture at occipital borne is found place on the petiitoners and the doctor has opined the nature of injury as grevious.

As a result, the rider and pillion riders were thrown out from the motor cycle and sustained grievous injuries. 9 10.Further case of the petitioner is that soon after the accident the people who gathered there rescued the said Mariyammal. The said Mariyammal has sustained severe head injuries and died on the spot itself. Immediately she was taken to the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital and the Doctors who examined her confirmed her death. The same was informed to concerned authorities and Post-mortem was conducted. 11.Further case of the petitioner is that the said accident took place only due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent herein. The Traffic Investigation Wing (East) Police, Coimbatore has registered a First Information Report against the 1st Respondent for the offense of rash and negligent driving in their Crime No. 290/2014 dated 19-07-2014 u/s 279, 338 & 304(A) of IPC. 12.Further case of the petitioner is that at the time of accident, the 1st respondent herein was the driver and the 2nd respondent was the registered owner of the offending bus bearing Registration No. TN-33-N-2588 which caused the said accident. But for the 1st Respondent's rash and negligent driving of the said offending Bus, the said accident would not have taken place. There was no negligence on part of P. Masanamuthu. 13.Per contra the case of the 2nd respondent is that there is no negligence on the part of the 1st respondent who drove the bus bearing registration No. TN 33 N 2588 following the trafic rules and hence the respondents are not liable to compensate the petitioners. Further they would contend that as there is no fault on the part of the 1st respondent he is contesting the case lodged against him for the offences under 279,338, 304(A) IPC. 14.This Court has given it's anxious consideration on the rival contention of both parties. On perusal of Ex.P1 it reveals that on 19-07-2014 FIR is registered as against the 1st respondent for the offences under 279, 338, 304(A) IPC and vide Ex.P2 dated 6-09-2014 Final Report is filed as against R1 and ExP3 is the rough sketch showing the accident occurred near Shri. Nayagi Automobiles, Chinniampalayam and Ex.P4 is the M.V . Report in respect of the two wheeler driven by PW2 in which the deceased was a pillion rider,and 10 Ex.P5 is the M.V . Report in respect of bus belongs to 2nd respondent driven by 1st respondent and Ex.P6 is the Post Mortem Report of deceased Mariammal in which it has stated that the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries and no adverse remark has been stated, and Ex.P7 is the death certificate of Mariammal. 15.In support of the case the petitioners have examined the rider of two wheeler in which deceased Mariammal was riding as a pillion rider. On perusal of deposition of PW2 he would categorically depose that the bus driven by 1st respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the vehicle driven by him. Further he would depose that when they were proceeding in the road the offending bus without honking and making any indication attempted to over take them due to which it hit the two wheeler driven by him due to which they all fell down. Corroborating the evidence of PW2, Ex.P5 MV .I. Report in respect of the offending bus reveals that a paint scratch marks near rare left door steps. 16.Further though notice was duly served upon the 1st respondent who is the driver of the offending bus he reamined absent and he was set ex-parte on 22-12-2015. R1 is the right person who could speak about the manner of accident however remained absent. 17.Therefore taking into consideration of the evidence of PW2 and the available materials in hand this court is of the considered view that the petitioners have prima facie established that it is the 1st respondent who has driven the vehicle in a rash and the negligent manner and without making any sound and indication attempted to over take the vehicle driven by R1 and hit against it due to which all of them where thrown away and sustained injuries and due to which the deceased also died. Hence as prema facie materials are available as against R1 this court of the considered view that R1 alone drove the offending bus in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. Hence Point No. 1 is answered accordingly. POINT NO.2: Who is liable to pay compensation? 11 18.As point No.1 is answered against the 1st Respondent he as the driver of the offending vehicle, the 2nd Respondent the owner of the offending vehicle are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the Petitioners. Hence point No.2 is answered accordingly. POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 19.At the time of accident, the deceased was aged about 28 years, hale, healthy young woman, working as a Labour in a Banian Company, Tiruppur and was earning Rs.15,000/- per month. The 1st petitioner is the husband of the deceased aged about 30 years, lost his beloved wife and her caring and sharing that can be given only by his wife. The 2nd petitioner is the only daughter of the deceased, is just aged 4 years has lost her beloved mother and her love and affection at her tender age. The 1st petitioner has to look after his minor daughter in future. Due to the permanent absence of the deceased Mariyammal, the house of the petitioners looks deserted. Both the petitioners were the dependents of the income of the deceased. Their entire present and future are put into darkness and gloomy. 20.Though the petitioners would contend that the deceased was working as a labour in a Banian Company Tirupur and was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- p.m. absolutely there is no evidence adduced by the petitioners in order to prove the same. Therefore as per the rules laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.6,000/- is taken as notional income of the deceased. 21.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives are the dependence of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it 12 should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 22.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may produced to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Accordingly depending upon the facts and circumstances of this case the income of the deceased is fixed as Rs.6,000/- p.m., and as already discussed age of the deceased is fixed as 28. Considering the age of the deceased 40% of the income is taken as future prospects which comes to Rs.2,400/- in total income Rs.8,400/- In respect of the age there is no dispute and there is no contra evidence available age of the deceased is fixed as 28. As per Sharla Varma case multiplier is 17. as there are four dependents the appropriate deduction for personal expenses is 1/3 . 23.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as th income of the deceased is Rs.8,400/-. Hence Rs.8,400 X 12 X 17 = Rs.17,13,600/- and 1/3rd personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.5,71,200/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs.17,13,600 – 5,71.200 = Rs.11,42,400/-. 24.As per the latest Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court for loss of estate the petitioners are entitled for a sum of Rs.15,000/- and the 1st petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.40,000/- by way of consortium and all the petitioners for a sum of Rs.15,000/- for funeral expenses. 25.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.11,42,400/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs.15,000/- 3 Loss of consortium Rs.40,000/- 4 Funeral Expenses Rs.15,000/- 13 TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.12,12,400/- 26. From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.12,12,400/- -towards compensation and the Respondent is liable to pay a sum of Rs.12,12,400/- with interest . 27. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.3,12,400/-of claim amount and the 2nd minor petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs. 9,00,000/- of claim amount. Hence point Nos.3 & 4 are answered accordingly. 28. In respect of petition filed in MCOP. 470/15 is concerned the petitioner would contend that a t the time of accident, the minor petitioner N. Vishnupriya was hale and healthy just aged 4 years studying in a play school nearby her house. Due to the accident the Minor petitioner feels severe head ache, loss of concentration, diminishing power of vision, giddiness and tiredness. She is confined to bed rest need others aid even to do her day to day normal works due to the permanent disabilities arising out of the injuries. In the said accident the minor petitioner's mother also sustained grievous injuries and died on the spot itself. Now the petitioner is only looking after the minor N. Vishnupriya with great difficulty. Due to the sudden impact of the accident the entire family is suffering both physically and monetarily; However no doctor certificate is enclosed or filed before the Court.

On perusal of deposition of PW2 he would categorically depose that the bus driven by 1st respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the vehicle driven by him. Further he would depose that when they were proceeding in the road the offending bus without honking and making any indication attempted to over take them due to which it hit the two wheeler driven by him due to which they all fell down. Corroborating the evidence of PW2, Ex.P5 MV .I. Report in respect of the offending bus reveals that a paint scratch marks near rare left door steps. 16.Further though notice was duly served upon the 1st respondent who is the driver of the offending bus he reamined absent and he was set ex-parte on 22-12-2015. R1 is the right person who could speak about the manner of accident however remained absent. 17.Therefore taking into consideration of the evidence of PW2 and the available materials in hand this court is of the considered view that the petitioners have prima facie established that it is the 1st respondent who has driven the vehicle in a rash and the negligent manner and without making any sound and indication attempted to over take the vehicle driven by R1 and hit against it due to which all of them where thrown away and sustained injuries and due to which the deceased also died. Hence as prema facie materials are available as against R1 this court of the considered view that R1 alone drove the offending bus in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. Hence Point No. 1 is answered accordingly. POINT NO.2: Who is liable to pay compensation? 11 18.As point No.1 is answered against the 1st Respondent he as the driver of the offending vehicle, the 2nd Respondent the owner of the offending vehicle are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the Petitioners. Hence point No.2 is answered accordingly. POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 19.At the time of accident, the deceased was aged about 28 years, hale, healthy young woman, working as a Labour in a Banian Company, Tiruppur and was earning Rs.15,000/- per month. The 1st petitioner is the husband of the deceased aged about 30 years, lost his beloved wife and her caring and sharing that can be given only by his wife. The 2nd petitioner is the only daughter of the deceased, is just aged 4 years has lost her beloved mother and her love and affection at her tender age. The 1st petitioner has to look after his minor daughter in future. Due to the permanent absence of the deceased Mariyammal, the house of the petitioners looks deserted. Both the petitioners were the dependents of the income of the deceased. Their entire present and future are put into darkness and gloomy. 20.Though the petitioners would contend that the deceased was working as a labour in a Banian Company Tirupur and was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- p.m. absolutely there is no evidence adduced by the petitioners in order to prove the same. Therefore as per the rules laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.6,000/- is taken as notional income of the deceased. 21.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives are the dependence of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it 12 should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 22.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may produced to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Accordingly depending upon the facts and circumstances of this case the income of the deceased is fixed as Rs.6,000/- p.m., and as already discussed age of the deceased is fixed as 28. Considering the age of the deceased 40% of the income is taken as future prospects which comes to Rs.2,400/- in total income Rs.8,400/- In respect of the age there is no dispute and there is no contra evidence available age of the deceased is fixed as 28. As per Sharla Varma case multiplier is 17. as there are four dependents the appropriate deduction for personal expenses is 1/3 . 23.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as th income of the deceased is Rs.8,400/-. Hence Rs.8,400 X 12 X 17 = Rs.17,13,600/- and 1/3rd personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.5,71,200/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs.17,13,600 – 5,71.200 = Rs.11,42,400/-. 24.As per the latest Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court for loss of estate the petitioners are entitled for a sum of Rs.15,000/- and the 1st petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.40,000/- by way of consortium and all the petitioners for a sum of Rs.15,000/- for funeral expenses. 25.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.11,42,400/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs.15,000/- 3 Loss of consortium Rs.40,000/- 4 Funeral Expenses Rs.15,000/- 13 TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.12,12,400/- 26. From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.12,12,400/- -towards compensation and the Respondent is liable to pay a sum of Rs.12,12,400/- with interest . 27. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.3,12,400/-of claim amount and the 2nd minor petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs. 9,00,000/- of claim amount. Hence point Nos.3 & 4 are answered accordingly. 28. In respect of petition filed in MCOP. 470/15 is concerned the petitioner would contend that a t the time of accident, the minor petitioner N. Vishnupriya was hale and healthy just aged 4 years studying in a play school nearby her house. Due to the accident the Minor petitioner feels severe head ache, loss of concentration, diminishing power of vision, giddiness and tiredness. She is confined to bed rest need others aid even to do her day to day normal works due to the permanent disabilities arising out of the injuries. In the said accident the minor petitioner's mother also sustained grievous injuries and died on the spot itself. Now the petitioner is only looking after the minor N. Vishnupriya with great difficulty. Due to the sudden impact of the accident the entire family is suffering both physically and monetarily; However no doctor certificate is enclosed or filed before the Court.

Their entire present and future are put into darkness and gloomy. 20.Though the petitioners would contend that the deceased was working as a labour in a Banian Company Tirupur and was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- p.m. absolutely there is no evidence adduced by the petitioners in order to prove the same. Therefore as per the rules laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.6,000/- is taken as notional income of the deceased. 21.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives are the dependence of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it 12 should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 22.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may produced to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Accordingly depending upon the facts and circumstances of this case the income of the deceased is fixed as Rs.6,000/- p.m., and as already discussed age of the deceased is fixed as 28. Considering the age of the deceased 40% of the income is taken as future prospects which comes to Rs.2,400/- in total income Rs.8,400/- In respect of the age there is no dispute and there is no contra evidence available age of the deceased is fixed as 28. As per Sharla Varma case multiplier is 17. as there are four dependents the appropriate deduction for personal expenses is 1/3 . 23.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as th income of the deceased is Rs.8,400/-. Hence Rs.8,400 X 12 X 17 = Rs.17,13,600/- and 1/3rd personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.5,71,200/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs.17,13,600 – 5,71.200 = Rs.11,42,400/-. 24.As per the latest Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court for loss of estate the petitioners are entitled for a sum of Rs.15,000/- and the 1st petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.40,000/- by way of consortium and all the petitioners for a sum of Rs.15,000/- for funeral expenses. 25.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.11,42,400/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs.15,000/- 3 Loss of consortium Rs.40,000/- 4 Funeral Expenses Rs.15,000/- 13 TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.12,12,400/- 26. From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.12,12,400/- -towards compensation and the Respondent is liable to pay a sum of Rs.12,12,400/- with interest . 27. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.3,12,400/-of claim amount and the 2nd minor petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs. 9,00,000/- of claim amount.

Mariyammal was riding as a pillion rider with her sister's husband P. Masanamuthu in his Motor cycle bearing Registration No. TN 37 AE-2138 and her daughter one Vishnupriya and her sister Subbulakshmi were pillion riders.

The same was informed to concerned authorities and Post-mortem was conducted. 11.Further case of the petitioner is that the said accident took place only due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent herein. The Traffic Investigation Wing (East) Police, Coimbatore has registered a First Information Report against the 1st Respondent for the offense of rash and negligent driving in their Crime No. 290/2014 dated 19-07-2014 u/s 279, 338 & 304(A) of IPC. 12.Further case of the petitioner is that at the time of accident, the 1st respondent herein was the driver and the 2nd respondent was the registered owner of the offending bus bearing Registration No. TN-33-N-2588 which caused the said accident.

Further they would contend that as there is no fault on the part of the 1st respondent he is contesting the case lodged against him for the offences under 279,338, 304(A) IPC. 14.This Court has given it's anxious consideration on the rival contention of both parties. On perusal of Ex.P1 it reveals that on 19-07-2014 FIR is registered as against the 1st respondent for the offences under 279, 338, 304(A) IPC and vide Ex.P2 dated 6-09-2014 Final Report is filed as against R1 and ExP3 is the rough sketch showing the accident occurred near Shri. Nayagi Automobiles, Chinniampalayam and Ex.P4 is the M.V . Report in respect of the two wheeler driven by PW2 in which the deceased was a pillion rider,and 10 Ex.P5 is the M.V . Report in respect of bus belongs to 2nd respondent driven by 1st respondent and Ex.P6 is the Post Mortem Report of deceased Mariammal in which it has stated that the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries and no adverse remark has been stated, and Ex.P7 is the death certificate of Mariammal. 15.In support of the case the petitioners have examined the rider of two wheeler in which deceased Mariammal was riding as a pillion rider. On perusal of deposition of PW2 he would categorically depose that the bus driven by 1st respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the vehicle driven by him. Further he would depose that when they were proceeding in the road the offending bus without honking and making any indication attempted to over take them due to which it hit the two wheeler driven by him due to which they all fell down. Corroborating the evidence of PW2, Ex.P5 MV .I. Report in respect of the offending bus reveals that a paint scratch marks near rare left door steps. 16.Further though notice was duly served upon the 1st respondent who is the driver of the offending bus he reamined absent and he was set ex-parte on 22-12-2015. R1 is the right person who could speak about the manner of accident however remained absent. 17.Therefore taking into consideration of the evidence of PW2 and the available materials in hand this court is of the considered view that the petitioners have prima facie established that it is the 1st respondent who has driven the vehicle in a rash and the negligent manner and without making any sound and indication attempted to over take the vehicle driven by R1 and hit against it due to which all of them where thrown away and sustained injuries and due to which the deceased also died. Hence as prema facie materials are available as against R1 this court of the considered view that R1 alone drove the offending bus in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. Hence Point No. 1 is answered accordingly. POINT NO.2: Who is liable to pay compensation? 11 18.As point No.1 is answered against the 1st Respondent he as the driver of the offending vehicle, the 2nd Respondent the owner of the offending vehicle are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the Petitioners. Hence point No.2 is answered accordingly. POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 19.At the time of accident, the deceased was aged about 28 years, hale, healthy young woman, working as a Labour in a Banian Company, Tiruppur and was earning Rs.15,000/- per month. The 1st petitioner is the husband of the deceased aged about 30 years, lost his beloved wife and her caring and sharing that can be given only by his wife. The 2nd petitioner is the only daughter of the deceased, is just aged 4 years has lost her beloved mother and her love and affection at her tender age. The 1st petitioner has to look after his minor daughter in future. Due to the permanent absence of the deceased Mariyammal, the house of the petitioners looks deserted. Both the petitioners were the dependents of the income of the deceased. Their entire present and future are put into darkness and gloomy. 20.Though the petitioners would contend that the deceased was working as a labour in a Banian Company Tirupur and was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- p.m. absolutely there is no evidence adduced by the petitioners in order to prove the same. Therefore as per the rules laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.6,000/- is taken as notional income of the deceased. 21.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives are the dependence of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it 12 should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 22.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may produced to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Accordingly depending upon the facts and circumstances of this case the income of the deceased is fixed as Rs.6,000/- p.m., and as already discussed age of the deceased is fixed as 28. Considering the age of the deceased 40% of the income is taken as future prospects which comes to Rs.2,400/- in total income Rs.8,400/- In respect of the age there is no dispute and there is no contra evidence available age of the deceased is fixed as 28. As per Sharla Varma case multiplier is 17. as there are four dependents the appropriate deduction for personal expenses is 1/3 . 23.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as th income of the deceased is Rs.8,400/-. Hence Rs.8,400 X 12 X 17 = Rs.17,13,600/- and 1/3rd personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.5,71,200/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs.17,13,600 – 5,71.200 = Rs.11,42,400/-. 24.As per the latest Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court for loss of estate the petitioners are entitled for a sum of Rs.15,000/- and the 1st petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.40,000/- by way of consortium and all the petitioners for a sum of Rs.15,000/- for funeral expenses. 25.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.11,42,400/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs.15,000/- 3 Loss of consortium Rs.40,000/- 4 Funeral Expenses Rs.15,000/- 13 TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.12,12,400/- 26. From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.12,12,400/- -towards compensation and the Respondent is liable to pay a sum of Rs.12,12,400/- with interest . 27. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.3,12,400/-of claim amount and the 2nd minor petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs. 9,00,000/- of claim amount.

Due to the accident the Minor petitioner feels severe head ache, loss of concentration, diminishing power of vision, giddiness and tiredness. She is confined to bed rest need others aid even to do her day to day normal works due to the permanent disabilities arising out of the injuries. In the said accident the minor petitioner's mother also sustained grievous injuries and died on the spot itself. Now the petitioner is only looking after the minor N. Vishnupriya with great difficulty.

He was earning Rs.7,000/- per month out of his job. Due to the sudden demise of Dharmalingam, the 1st petitioner lost her husband and the only bread winner and the Petitioners 2 to 4 lost their father at their young age and the loss of their father is absolute in-nature which cannot be regained at any cost or compensated by monetary means. iv)The accident took place by the rash and negligent manner of the 1st respondent who is the driver cum owner of the vehicle TVS Scooty Wego bearing Regn. No. TN 66 E 2279 and hence a criminal case has been registered by the Traffic Investigation Wing (Central) in Cr. No.17/2013. Therefore, the Respondent is solely liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. . 3.Though summons were duly served upon the respondent remained absent and set ex-parte on 25-02-2016 4. POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the respondent has drove TVS Scooty Wego bearing Regn. No. TN 66 E 2279, on 13-01-2013in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation? 3 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation? 4.If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 5.On behalf of the petitioners, the 3rd petitioner was examined as PW-1 and 14 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P14. And one Marimuthu was examined as PW-2 and Ex.X1 is marked. The Respondent was called absent and set ex-parte. POINT No.1:- Whether the respondent has drove TVS Scooty Wego bearing Regn. No. TN 66 E 2279, on 13-01-2013in a rash and negligent manner? 6.The case of the Petitioners is that the claim application is filed in respect of the death of Dharmalingam who died in road accident on 13-01-2013. The 1st petitioner is the wife, 2nd to 4th petitioners are his daughters and the 5th petitioner is his mother. During pendency of the case the 5th petitioner died. 7.Further case of the Petitioners that on 13-01-2013 at about 9.00 P.M the respondent drove the vehicle TVS Scooty Wego bearing Regn. No. TN 66 E 2279 and from East to West direction at Trichy Road, Opposite to CTC Bus Depot, with a rash and negligent manner without making horn and against traffic rules and hit the deceased who was crossing the road. Due to the sudden accident, the deceased was thrown out and sustained head injury. The deceased was taken to CMC Hospital by nearby persons but he died on the way to hospital. 8.Though notice was properly served upon the Respondent he failed to appear before this court and hence he was set ex-parte. 9.In support of their case the Petitioners examined one Marimuthu who would depose that on 13.01.2013 he saw the vehicle driven by the Respondent came and in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and due to which the deceased died on the way to hospital. 4 10.This court has given its anxious consideration on the contentions of the petitioners. On perusal of Ex.P1 FIR it reveals a case is registered as against the Respondent for the offence u/s.279 and 304(A) IPC and the rough sketch of the incident is also marked as Ex.P5. Further based on the FIR and after due investigation final report is filed as against the Respondent for the offence u/s.279 and 304(A) IPC. And on perusal of the Post Mortem certificate the Doctor who conducted the autopsy on the body of the deceased has opined that the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries and no adverse remarks is mentioned against the deceased in the report. 11.Therefore, taking into consideration of the material papers on hand, as there is no contra evidence available against the above said fact this court is of the considered view that the Petitioners have prima facie proved that the Respondent alone driven his vehicle TVS Scooty Wego bearing Regn. No. TN 66 E 2279 in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident due to which the deceased died. Hence the Respondent alone is responsible for the accident and hence point No.1 is answered against the Respondent. POINT NO.2:- Who is liable to pay compensation? 12.As Point No.1 is answered against the respondent, he is liable to pay the compensation to the petitioners. Hence, point No.2 is answered accordingly. POINT NO.3 & 4 :- Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 13.Now coming to the quantum of compensation is concerned the case of the Petitioners is that at the time of accident the deceased was hale and healthy person and he was working as “Watchman” in Super Airports Karikkal (P) Ltd., Thomas Park, Race Course, Coimbatore. He was earning Rs.7,000/- per month out of his job. Due to the sudden demise of Dharmalingam, the 1st petitioner lost her husband and their only bread winner. The 2nd to 5 4th petitioners lost their beloved father at their young age and the loss of their father is absolute in-nature which cannot be regained at any cost or compensated by monetary means. 14.Further case of the Petitioners is that but for the rash and negligent driving of the rider of TVS Schooty Wego bearing Regn. No. TN 66 E 2279 the accident would not have taken place. The accident took place by the rash and negligent manner of the respondent who is the driver cum owner of the vehicle, therefore, the Respondent is liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 15.As already stated the Respondent remained absent and he was set ex-parte. It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives who are the dependents of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 16.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may produced to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 17.Hence from the available materials in hand the quantum of compensation is to be calculated. Now coming to the age of the deceased, the case of the Petitioners is that the age of the deceased at the time of the accident is 60. However on perusal of Ex.P2 Post Mortem Report the age of the deceased in mentioned as 65. Further in the death certificate it is mentioned as 60. Hence considering the deposition of PW-1 and taking into consideration of the death certificate the this court holds that the age of the deceased is 60 at the time of the 6 accident. 18.Now coming to the income of the deceased the Petitioners would contend that the deceased was hale and healthy person and he was working as “Watchman” in Super Airports Karikkal (P) Ltd., Thomas Park, Race Course, Coimbatore. He was earning Rs.7,000/- per month out of his job. However none was examined in this aspect and no documentary proof is filed to prove the same. Hence taking into consideration of the age of the deceased notional income of the deceased is taken for awarding compensation. 19.In so far as the income is concerned, that the Honourable Supreme Court had fixed Rs.6,500/- for a vegetable vendor as monthly income in the judgment reported in 2014 (1) TNMAC 459 (SC) = 2014(2) SCC 735 [Syed Saliq vs Divisional Manager, United India Insurance Company Limited] . In the said Judgment the Hon’ble Apex Court has in Paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 held as follows: “7. Further, the Appellant claims that he was working as a vegetable vendor. It is true that a vegetable vendor might not require mobility to the extent that he sells vegetables at one place. However, the occupation of vegetable vending is not confined to selling veg - etables from a particular location. It rather involves procuring vegetables from the whole- sale market or the farmers and then selling it off in the retail market. This often involves selling vegetables in the cart which requires 100% mobility. But even by conservative ap - proach, if we presume that the vegetable vending by the Appellant/claimant involved selling vegetables from one place, the claimant would require assistance with his mobility in bring - ing vegetables to the market place which otherwise would be extremely difficult for him with an amputated leg. We are required to be sensitive while dealing with manual labour cases where loss of limb is often equivalent to loss of livelihood. Yet, considering that the Appel - lant/claimant is still capable to fend for his livelihood once he is brought in the market place, we determine the disability at 85% to determine the loss of income. 7 8. The Appellant/claimant in his appeal further claimed that he had been earning 10,000/- p.m. by doing vegetable vending work. The High Court however, considered the loss of income at 3500/- p.m. considering that the claimant did not produce any document to establish his loss of income. It is difficult for us to convince ourselves as to how a labour involved in an unorganized sector doing his own business is expected to produce documents to prove his monthly income. In this regard, this Court, in the case of Ramchandrappa v. Manager, Royal Sundaram Alliance Co. Limited (2011) 13 SCC 236, has held as under: 9. There is no reason, in the instant case for the Tribunal and the High Court to ask for evidence of monthly income of the Appellant/claimant. On the other hand, going by the present state of economy and the rising prices in agricultural products, we are inclined to believe that a vegetable vendor is reasonably capable of earning Rs. 6,500/- per month. The above judgment would categorically rule that there cannot be positive evidence for a per - son who is involved in an unorganized sector doing his own business and hence the court has to guestimate the monthly income having regard to the fact that the Honourable Supreme Court had taken Rs.6,500/- for a vegetable vender and in the present case, consid - ering the age of the deceased as 38 years and considering the dependents are concerned, three minor children are there and hence the income can be fixed at Rs.6,500/- and proper multiplier as per the Judgment in Sarla Verma and Others vs Delhi Transport corporation and another reported in 2009(2) TNMAC 1(SC) the multiplier for the age of 38 would be 15 and considering the fact that the deceased is aged about 38 years and I have already held that the deceased is a agriculturist by profession hence 50% towards future prospects has to be taken and the deduction has to be 1/3rd for the personal expenses of the deceased in view of the petitioners are 3 in number. 20.further in so far as the future prospects for persons working in an unorganized sector is concerned the Honourable Supreme Court in 2013 ACJ 1403 in the case between Rajesh and Others V Rajbir Singh and others held as follows: “18. Therefore, we do not think that while making the observations in the last three lines of paragraph 24 of Sarla Verma's Judgment, the Court had intended to lay down an 8 absolute rule that there will be no addition in the income of a person who is self employed or who is paid fixed wages. Rather, it would be reasonable to say that a person who is self- employed or is engaged on fixed wages will also get 30 per cent increase in his total income ever a period of time and if he/she becomes victim of accident then the same formula de - serves to be applied for calculating the amount of compensation”. 21.In addition, the Hon’ble Apex Court in 2014(1) TNMAC 279 , (Larger Bench Judg - ment of the Honourable Supreme Court) in the case between Sanjay Verma V Haryana Roadways held as follows: “12. The view taken in Santosh Devi (supra) has been reiterated by a Bench of Three Judges in Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others,by holding as follows: “8.Since, the Court in Santosh Devi case actually intended to follow the principle in the case of salaried persons as laid down in Sarla Verma case and to make it applicable also to the self-employed and persons on fixed wages, it is clarified that the increase in the case of those groups is not 30% always; it will also have a reference to the age. In other words, in the case of self-employed or persons with fixed wages, in case, the deceased vic - tim was below 40 years, there must be an addition of 50% to the actual income of the de - ceased while computing Future Prospects. Needless to say that the actual income should be income after paying the tax, if any. Addition should be 30% in case the deceased was in the age group of 40 to 50 years”. 22.Therefore, taking into consideration of the evidence of PW-1 and the guidelines of the Hon'ble Supreme Court notional income of the deceased is taken as Rs.6,500/- per month and as the deceased is aged about 60 the question of future prospectus will not arise. Further as per the law laid down by the Hon'nble Apex Court in Sarala Varma case the relevant multiplier is 9 and as per the law laid in the same judgment and taking Considering the fact that there are 4 claimants / dependents in the family of the deceased. 1/3rd of the monthly income of the deceased is taken for the personal expenditure of the deceased. 9 23.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as t he income of the de - ceased is Rs.6,500/- hence Rs.6,500 x 9 x 12 = Rs.7,02,000/- and 1/3rd personal expendi- ture of the deceased is comes to [Rs.2,34,000 ]. And the Loss of Income of the deceased comes to [Rs. 7,02,000– Rs. 2,34,000 /-] is Rs.4,68,000/- 24.Now coming into the aspect of awarding compensation under the head consortium the Honourable Supreme Court had held that the wife is entitled for consortium to the extent of Rs.1,00,000/- and the Honourable Supreme Court in2013 ACJ 1403 Rajesh and Others V Rajbir Singh in Para 20 held as follows: “20. We may therefore, revisit the practice of awarding compensation under conven - tional heads, Loss of Consortium to the spouse, Loss of Love, care and guidance to children and Funeral Expenses. It may be noted that the sum of Rs.2,500/- to Rs.10,000/- in those heads was fixed several decades ago and having regard to inflation factor, the some needs to be increased. In Sarla Varma's case (supra), it was held that Compensation for Loss of Consortium should be in the range of Rs.5,000/- to Rs.10,000/- In legal parlance, 'consor - tium' is the right of the spouse to the Company, care, help, comfort, guidance, society, so - lace, affection and sexual relations with his or her mate. That non-pecuniary head of dam - ages has not been properly understood by our Courts. The Loss of Companionship, Love, Care and Protection, etc., the spouse is entitled to get, has to be compensated appropriately. The Concept of Non-Pecuniary Damage for Loss of Consortium' is one of the major head of award of Compensation in other parts of the world more particularly in the United States of America, Australia, etc., English Courts have also recognized the right of a spouse to get Compensation even during the period of temporary disablement. By Loss of Consortium, the Courts have made an attempt to compensate the loss of spouse's affection, comfort, so - lace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations during the future years. Unlike the Compensation awarded in other countries and other jurisdictions, since the Legal Heirs are otherwise adequately compensated for the Pecuniary Loss, it would not be proper to award a major amount under the head. Hence, we are of the view that it would only be just and reasonable that the Courts award at least rupees one lakh for Loss of Consortium”. 10 25.By following the above judgment, in the present case, considering the age of the de - ceased, this court holds that the 1st Petitioner is the husband of the deceased and considering her age she is entitled to a sum of Rs.50,000/- towards loss of consortium and further the petitioners are entitled each a sum of Rs.25,000/- [in total Rs.75,000/-] towards loss of love and affection and the Petitioners are entitled for a sum of Rs.25,000/- towards funeral expenses Therefore, in total, the petitioners are entitled to a sum of Rs. 6,18,000/-towards compensation as listed below; Sl.No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs. Rs.4,68,000 /- 2 Loss of Love and Affection for Petitioners 2 to 4 Rs. 75,000/- 3 Loss of Consortium (to the 1st Petitioner) Rs. 50,000/- 6 Funeral Expenses Rs. 25,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs. 6,18,000/- From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs. 6,18,000 /- towards compensation. And out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.4,68,000/- of claim amount and the Petitioner 2 to 4 are entitled for Rs.50,000/- of claim amount each. Hence, the Point No.3 & 4 are answered accordingly. In the result , the Respondent is liable to pay a sum of Rs.6,18,000/- with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.4,68,000/- of claim amount with interest; and the 2nd to 4th Petitioners are entitled for a sum of Rs.50,000/- of claim amount each with interest; After deposit, the petitioners are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount with interest 11 immediately. The deficit court fee of Rs.5180/ - is ordered to be paid by the Petitioners within 15 days. The Advocate fees is fixed at Rs.10,360/- to be paid by the respondents by a separate cheque.

BRIEF A VERMENTS CONTAINED IN THE PETITION :- i.At the time of accident, the 1st petitioner's husband Senthil Kumar was 39 years old and he was hale and healthy. On 12-12-2010, the 1st petitioner's husband Senthil Kumar 2 was carrying furniture in the mini-door vehicle bearing registration No. TN 37 AM 8265 along with one Karuppasamy (friend). After unloading the furnitures they were returning. At that time driver the 1st respondent Balasubramanian who drove the mini-door vehicle carelessly and at reckless speed, applied brake suddenly. As a result the said Senthilkumar was thrown out of the vehicle and fell down. Immediately, the said Karuppusamy got down and looked at the said Senthilkumar. The said Senthilkumar had received a blow on his head and blood was oozing out from his left ear. Immediately, in the same vehicle he was taken to nearby hospital. There, they were advised to go to some other hospital. Hence, the said Senthilkumar was taken to Ganga Medical Centre and Hospital (P) Ltd., Coimbatore. He was admitted there at 8.20 p.m on the same day. But in spite of medical treatment, he could not recover from the Grievous head injuries. He died on the following day i.e., 13-12- 2010 at 8.10 p.m. This accident happened only due to the rash and negligent drive of the 1st respondent. ii.The said Karuppusamy lodged the complaint before the Coimbatore Corporation TIW (E) Police Station against the 1st respondent (driver Balasubramaniam) and the case was registered against him in FIR No. 361/10, dated 13-12-2010 under section 279, 338 of IPC for rash and negligent way of driving of the said Mini-Door vehicle bearing registration No. TN 37 AM 8265. The 2nd petitioner is the owner of the vehicle and the 3rd petitioner is the Insurance Company of the vehicle. At the time of accident the vehicle covered the valid Insurance Policy by the 3rd respondent. iii.The deceased had his own auto and operating it on hire basis. He was earning about Rs.15,000/- per month. At the time of accident the decesed was aged about 38 years. He was hale and helathy till the date of accident. He was the only bread winner of the family. His family (Petitioners) was depending upon the income of the deceased. Now they lost their source of income. The 1st petitioner is the wife, the 2nd and 3rd petitioners are the sons and the 4th petitioner is the mother of the deceased. That the deceased Senthil Kumar's family (petitioners) had to undergo tremendous amount of mental agony and hardships, which cannot be explained in words. The deceased Senthil Kumar being an ordinary middle class person had neither immovable, movable properties of worth consideration nor any 3 savings. Now the family is struggling hard for their livelihood. Since, the accient was occurred at Puliyakulam to Sunkam Road, Coimbatore, all are happened within the jurisdiction of this Hon'ble Court. iv.The petitioners have not filed any other petition before any other Court or Forum or Tribunal for claiming compensation, except this petition before this Hon'ble Court. 3.THE A VERMENTS IN THE COUNTER STATEMENT FILED BY THE 3RD RESPONDENT:- i.The claim petition claiming a sum of Rs.20,00,000/- on account of death of Senthilkumar S/o Arumugam in a motor vehicle accident that occurred on 12-12-2010 at about 6.30 p.m involving Bajaj Temp (Minidoor Auto) bearing Registration No. TN 37 AM 8265 is not maintainable both in law and on the facts of the case. ii.Except the matters that are specifically admitted herein by the 3rd respondent, all other averments and allegations contained in the petition are all denied as false by them and the petitioners are put to strict proof of the same. iii.At the out set the petitioners are put to strict proof that the accident occurred solely due to rash and negligent driving of Bajaj Tempo (Minidor Auto) bearing Registration No. TN 37 AM 8265 by the 1st respondent himself and that he was in possession of valid DL to drive the insured vehicle at the time of alleged accident. iv.The preliminary investigation arranged by the 3rd respondent reveals that the insured vehicle Bajaj tempo is authorized to carry only driver in the cabin; whereas at the time of alleged accident, the 1st respondent deliberately allowed two persons to travel in the cabin besides the driver, whereby the accident occurred when the 1st respondent applied sudden brake while noticing hump at little distance. The sole reason for Senthil Kumar's death was due to above said vital reasons. For own negligence and flaw of law by 1st and 2nd respondents, there is no ground or justification to indemnify them within the purview of 4 policy conditions of the 3rd respondent vicariously. v.The petitioners have filed the claim petition with twisted and distorted version of facts so as to gain the sympathy of this Hon'ble Court and to get a huge quantum of compensation if possible. The petitioners cannot be permitted to get a windfall or a source of profit out of the unfortunate motor vehicle accident. The deceased had no proved income nor did the petitioners produce documentary evidence to prove the regular earnings. Therefore the compensation claimed under the head of loss of earning capacity/loss of dependency is not tenable, 4th petitioner is presently residing with her 2nd husband due to desertion by 1st husband. Therefore 4th petitioner has no need to depend upon the deceased for her survival. vi.The 2nd respondent who was owner/insured of Bajaj Tempo (Minidor Auto) bearing Registration No. TN 37 AM 8265 has not co-operated with the 3rd respondent in contesting the claim petition stoutly and emphatically as required under the terms and conditions of insurance policy of the 3rd respondent. Therefore the 3rd respondent may be permitted to contest the case on all grounds that are available to the owner/insured of Bajaj Tempo (Minidor Auto) bearing Registration No. TN 37 AM 8265 without prejudice to own defence in accordance with Section 149 (2) of Motor Vehicles Act. The deceased traveled in the capacity of unauthorized passenger at the time of accident. Hence this respondent is not liable to pay any compensation to the petitioners. 4. POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending Mini-Door bearing its Registration No. TN 37 AM 8265 on 12-12-2010 in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 4. If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 5.On behalf of the petitioner, the petitioner was examined as PW-1, and 8 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P8. On behalf of the Respondents one Loganathan was 5 examined as RW-1, and one Sivakumar was examined as RW-2. On behalf of the Respondents no documents were marked. On behalf of the witness 5 documents were marked as Ex.X1 to Ex.X5. POINT No.1: Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending Mini-Door bearing its Registration No. TN 37 AM 8265 on 12-12-2010 in a rash and negligent manner? 6.The case of the petitioner is that on 12-12-2010 the deceased Senthilkumar transported furnitures and he along with one Karuppusamy was carrying the said furniture in a mini door vehicle bearing registration No. TN 37 AM 8265 and one Balasubramaniam the 1st respondent herein was driving the vehicle. After delivering the furnitures at Amma Furniture , Puliangulam they were returning from East to West direction. Near the Sungam Road the driver of the offending vehicle in which the deceased and his friend Karuppusamy were traveling proceeded in a rash and negligent manner and applied sudden brake. As a result of which the deceased Senthilkumar was thrown out of the vehicle and fell down. Immediately he was taken to the nearby hospital for treatment however as per the advice of the said hospital the injured was taken to Ganga Medical Centre and Hospital Private Limited. However without responding to the treatment given to the injured he died on 13- 12-2010 at about 8.10 p.m. 7.The petitioners would further contend that hence the above said Karuppusamy lodged a complaint before the Coimbatore Corporation TIW (E) P.S. against the 1st respondent and case was registered against him for the offences under 279, 338 of I.P.C. 8.Whereas the contention of 3rd respondent is that as against the terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy the driver of the offending vehicle allowed two more persons to be seated in the driver cabin apart from the driver and when the driver of the offending vehicle applied sudden brake while noticing hump at little distance. Therefore the driver of the vehicle was to apply sudden break and there is no negligence on the part of the 1st respondent. 6 9.This court has given its anxious consideration on the rival contentions of both the parties. On perusal of Ex.P2 F.I.R dated 13-12-2010 admittedly the case is registered as against the driver of the vehicle for the offences under 279, 338 I.P.C. and on perusal of Ex.P3 it reveals that the deceased died at Ganga Medical Centre and hospital private Limited. 10.On perusal of records the accident is not in dispute and the death of deceased is also not disputed it is suffice to conclude that it is the 1st respondent who drove the vehicle and the accident had occurred. 11.Though R1 is the correct person to depose about the manner of accident there is no contra evidence available against the claim of the petitioners that it is the 1st respondent who drove the vehicle and in a rash and negligent manner and applied the brake all of sudden due to which the deceased was thrown away from the vehicle and sustained severe injuries. Hence as the petitioners have prima facie established that it is the 1st respondent who drove the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident and hence Point No. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent. POINT NO.2: Who is liable to pay compensation? 12.Admittedly it is the 1st respondent who drove the offending vehicle on the date of the accident and the 2nd respondent is the owner of the said vehicle and the 3rd respondent is the insurer of the offending vehicle . Further as Point No.1 is answered against the 1st respondent all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 13.The case of the petitioner is that at the time of accident the deceased was aged about 7 38 years and he was hale and healthy and plying his own auto on hire basis and he was the only bread winner of the family. Further the petitioner would contend that the deceased was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- p.m. But for the accident the deceased would have survived for long years and would have been a great support to his family. 14.Whereas the contention of the 3rd respondent is that there is no evidence both oral and documentary in order to prove the income of the deceased and hence it is false to alleged that the deceased was earning a sum of rs.15,000/- p.m. 15.Further the 3rd respondent would contend that there is a clear violation of terms and conditions of the Policy and in support of the same they have examined one Loganathan from R.T.O. Office as R.W.1. And Ex.X1 to X4 marked. During his chief examination he would depose that as per the rules in the offending vehicle only two persons can travel however admittedly in the offending vehicle three persons were traveled which is against the rules of M.V . Act. 16.Further in support of the case the 3rd respondent is also examined one Sivakumar Legal officer of the 3rd respondent as RW2. and Ex,X5 was marked through this witness. Further during the chief examination he would depose that as the deceased traveled in the Mini-Door Vehicle against the policy rules and died of accident the 3rd respondent is not liable to compensate the petitioners. 17.Further during the course of argument the Ld. Counsel for the 3rd respondent would contend that the deceased was traveling as a gratuitous passenger and was not covered under the insurance policy and hence as the deceased is not a 3rd party according to the M.V . Act the 3rd respondent is not liable to compensate the petitioners. And if at all any liability is to be fixed the same is to be paid by the owner of the offending vehicle. The Ld. Counsel for the 3rd respondent also contended that the insurance company is also not statutorily required to cover the liability in respect of the passenger in goods vehicle u/s 147 unless such passenger is the owner or agent of the owner of the good accompanying such goods absolutely. There is no need for the insurance company to pay compensation since there is 8 no contractual liability under the statute to pay any amount to gratuitous passenger traveling in the goods vehicle. Hence the Ld. Counsel would contend that in the case in hand pay and recovery is also not attracted and the 3rd respondent is to be exhonarated. In support of his case the Ld. Counsel for the R3 relied upon the following judgments. i.I (2007) ACC 924(SC)... in the case between New India Assurance Co., Ltd....... Vs..... Vedwati & Others ….. ii.2011 (2) TN MAC 774... in the case between.... United India Insurance Company Ltd., Third Party Claims Office, No. 38, Anna Salai, Chennai – 2 …. Vs..... M. Thangavel and K.S. Kumar …. iii. 2007 ACJ 1043 in the case between New India Insurance Co., Ltd.,.... Vs..... Vedwati and others …. iv.III (2010) ACC 477 …... in the case between Subhash ….. Vs..... National Insurance Company Ltd., & Others …... v.C.M.A. Nos. 3706 to 3708 of 2013 and M.P. Nos. 1,1 & 1 of 2013 in the case between Iffco Tokio General Insurance Company Ltd., …. Vs..... Muthumani & 3 Others ….. 18.However contra to the evidence of RW1 and RW2 on perusal of Ex.X3/Ex.P5 R.C. Book of the Bajaj Tempo it reveals that it is a Mini-Door pick up van with seating capacity three persons. And further on perusal of Ex.X4 the 1st respondent driver was in possession of valid driving license and the 2nd respondent is the owner of the above said Mini-Door van and it is insured under the 3rd respondent. 19.Though in Ex.X5 the policy in respect of the offending vehicle it is mentioned that licensed carrying capacity is one. However the next page itself it has been categorically mentioned that the policy in respect of the offending vehicle is Commercial Vehicle Package Policy and in Sec. II under the head liability to 3rd parties the 3rd respondent has indemnified that the insured shall become legally liable to pay compensation in respect of death of or bodily injury to any person caused by or arising out of the use (including the loading and unloading of he Vehicle). Therefore it goes to show that the deceased is not a gratuitous passenger as claimed by the 3rd respondent 20.On perusal of Ex.P8 Post Mortem Certificate of the deceased it reveals that the 9 deceased would appear to have died of head injury sustained by him and his age is mentioned as 38 years. And Ex.P1 reveals that the petitioners are the legal heirs of the deceased. 21.Further this Court as meticulously gone through the citations relied upon by the 3rd respondent and analyzed the available materials in hand and is of the considered view that the arguments of Ld. Counsel for the 3rd respondent is not merit acceptance since on perusal of Ex.X3, the insurer has categorically mentioned that it is a Commercial Vehicle Package Policy and it is covered in respect of death or bodily injury to any person caused by or arising out of the use including the loading or unloading of the vehicle. Hence the Judgement relied upon by the 3rd respondent cited supra are of no avail based on the material evidence available in the case in hand. 22.Now coming to the age and income of the deceased the petitioners would contend that the deceased had its own auto and operating it on hire basis and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- p.m and during the time of accident he was aged about 38 years. However no oral as well as documentary evidence is available in respect of the above said contentions of the petitioners. And there is no evidence available to prove that the deceased was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- p.m except the oral evidence of P.W.1. Therefore as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case notional income of the deceased is to be taken into consideration for calculating the quantum of compensation to the petitioners. Hence considering the age of the deceased a notional income of sum of Rs.8,500/- is taken into consideration. 23.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or the dependents of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the 10 deceased. 24.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may proceed to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 25.Considering the age of the deceased notional income of a sum of Rs.8,500/- is taken into consideration. As per the latest Judgment Reported in 2017 (2) TN MAC 609 (SC) in the case between National Insurance Company Limited … Vs..... Pranay Sethi and others 40% of the income is taken as addition. Hence 40% of the income comes to Rs.3,400/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.8,500+ Rs.3,400/- which is comes to Rs.11,900/-. Hence a sum of 11,900 /- is fixed as income of the deceased. 26.And as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 15 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court considering the marital status of the deceased 1/4 of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 27.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as follows: Hence Rs.11,900 X 12 X 15 = Rs.21,42,000/- and ¼ personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.5,35,500/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs.21,42,000 – Rs.5,35,500 = Rs.16,06,500/- 28. Further as per the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for funeral expenses, and a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for loss of estate, and a sum of Rs.40,000/- was taken for loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner. 29. On perusal of Ex.P6 it reveals that, the petitioners are also entitled for a sum of Rs.6,000/- incurred towards Medical expenditure. 11 30.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows: Sl. No. Heads Amount 1Loss of Income Rs. 16,06,500/- 2Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/- 3Funeral Expenses Rs. 15,000/- 4Loss of consortium Rs. 40,000/- 5Medical Bills Rs. 6,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.16,82,500/- From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.16,82,500/-towards compensation and the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.16,82,500/-with interest. 31.Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.8,00,000/-of claim amount, and the 2nd and 3rd petitioners are entitled each for a sum of Rs.3,50,000/- of claim amount, and the 4th petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.1,82,500/- Hence point Nos.3 & 4 are answered accordingly. In the result, the Respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.16,82,500/- with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. And out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.8,00,000/- of claim amount and the 2nd and 3rd Petitioners are entitled each for a sum of Rs.3,50,000/- of claim amount and the 4th petitioner is entitled for Rs.1,82,500/- of claim amount. After deposit, the petitioners are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount with interest immediately. The court fee of Rs.16,198/- is ordered to be paid by the Petitioners within one month. The Advocate fees is fixed at Rs.22,825/- to be paid by the respondents by a separate cheque.

On perusal of Ex.P2 F.I.R dated 13-12-2010 admittedly the case is registered as against the driver of the vehicle for the offences under 279, 338 I.P.C. and on perusal of Ex.P3 it reveals that the deceased died at Ganga Medical Centre and hospital private Limited. 10.On perusal of records the accident is not in dispute and the death of deceased is also not disputed it is suffice to conclude that it is the 1st respondent who drove the vehicle and the accident had occurred. 11.Though R1 is the correct person to depose about the manner of accident there is no contra evidence available against the claim of the petitioners that it is the 1st respondent who drove the vehicle and in a rash and negligent manner and applied the brake all of sudden due to which the deceased was thrown away from the vehicle and sustained severe injuries. Hence as the petitioners have prima facie established that it is the 1st respondent who drove the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident and hence Point No. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent. POINT NO.2: Who is liable to pay compensation? 12.Admittedly it is the 1st respondent who drove the offending vehicle on the date of the accident and the 2nd respondent is the owner of the said vehicle and the 3rd respondent is the insurer of the offending vehicle . Further as Point No.1 is answered against the 1st respondent all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 13.The case of the petitioner is that at the time of accident the deceased was aged about 7 38 years and he was hale and healthy and plying his own auto on hire basis and he was the only bread winner of the family. Further the petitioner would contend that the deceased was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- p.m. But for the accident the deceased would have survived for long years and would have been a great support to his family. 14.Whereas the contention of the 3rd respondent is that there is no evidence both oral and documentary in order to prove the income of the deceased and hence it is false to alleged that the deceased was earning a sum of rs.15,000/- p.m. 15.Further the 3rd respondent would contend that there is a clear violation of terms and conditions of the Policy and in support of the same they have examined one Loganathan from R.T.O. Office as R.W.1. And Ex.X1 to X4 marked. During his chief examination he would depose that as per the rules in the offending vehicle only two persons can travel however admittedly in the offending vehicle three persons were traveled which is against the rules of M.V . Act. 16.Further in support of the case the 3rd respondent is also examined one Sivakumar Legal officer of the 3rd respondent as RW2. and Ex,X5 was marked through this witness. Further during the chief examination he would depose that as the deceased traveled in the Mini-Door Vehicle against the policy rules and died of accident the 3rd respondent is not liable to compensate the petitioners. 17.Further during the course of argument the Ld. Counsel for the 3rd respondent would contend that the deceased was traveling as a gratuitous passenger and was not covered under the insurance policy and hence as the deceased is not a 3rd party according to the M.V . Act the 3rd respondent is not liable to compensate the petitioners. And if at all any liability is to be fixed the same is to be paid by the owner of the offending vehicle. The Ld. Counsel for the 3rd respondent also contended that the insurance company is also not statutorily required to cover the liability in respect of the passenger in goods vehicle u/s 147 unless such passenger is the owner or agent of the owner of the good accompanying such goods absolutely. There is no need for the insurance company to pay compensation since there is 8 no contractual liability under the statute to pay any amount to gratuitous passenger traveling in the goods vehicle. Hence the Ld. Counsel would contend that in the case in hand pay and recovery is also not attracted and the 3rd respondent is to be exhonarated. In support of his case the Ld. Counsel for the R3 relied upon the following judgments. i.I (2007) ACC 924(SC)... in the case between New India Assurance Co., Ltd....... Vs..... Vedwati & Others ….. ii.2011 (2) TN MAC 774... in the case between.... United India Insurance Company Ltd., Third Party Claims Office, No. 38, Anna Salai, Chennai – 2 …. Vs..... M. Thangavel and K.S. Kumar …. iii. 2007 ACJ 1043 in the case between New India Insurance Co., Ltd.,.... Vs..... Vedwati and others …. iv.III (2010) ACC 477 …... in the case between Subhash ….. Vs..... National Insurance Company Ltd., & Others …... v.C.M.A. Nos. 3706 to 3708 of 2013 and M.P. Nos. 1,1 & 1 of 2013 in the case between Iffco Tokio General Insurance Company Ltd., …. Vs..... Muthumani & 3 Others ….. 18.However contra to the evidence of RW1 and RW2 on perusal of Ex.X3/Ex.P5 R.C. Book of the Bajaj Tempo it reveals that it is a Mini-Door pick up van with seating capacity three persons. And further on perusal of Ex.X4 the 1st respondent driver was in possession of valid driving license and the 2nd respondent is the owner of the above said Mini-Door van and it is insured under the 3rd respondent. 19.Though in Ex.X5 the policy in respect of the offending vehicle it is mentioned that licensed carrying capacity is one. However the next page itself it has been categorically mentioned that the policy in respect of the offending vehicle is Commercial Vehicle Package Policy and in Sec. II under the head liability to 3rd parties the 3rd respondent has indemnified that the insured shall become legally liable to pay compensation in respect of death of or bodily injury to any person caused by or arising out of the use (including the loading and unloading of he Vehicle). Therefore it goes to show that the deceased is not a gratuitous passenger as claimed by the 3rd respondent 20.On perusal of Ex.P8 Post Mortem Certificate of the deceased it reveals that the 9 deceased would appear to have died of head injury sustained by him and his age is mentioned as 38 years. And Ex.P1 reveals that the petitioners are the legal heirs of the deceased. 21.Further this Court as meticulously gone through the citations relied upon by the 3rd respondent and analyzed the available materials in hand and is of the considered view that the arguments of Ld. Counsel for the 3rd respondent is not merit acceptance since on perusal of Ex.X3, the insurer has categorically mentioned that it is a Commercial Vehicle Package Policy and it is covered in respect of death or bodily injury to any person caused by or arising out of the use including the loading or unloading of the vehicle. Hence the Judgement relied upon by the 3rd respondent cited supra are of no avail based on the material evidence available in the case in hand. 22.Now coming to the age and income of the deceased the petitioners would contend that the deceased had its own auto and operating it on hire basis and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- p.m and during the time of accident he was aged about 38 years. However no oral as well as documentary evidence is available in respect of the above said contentions of the petitioners. And there is no evidence available to prove that the deceased was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- p.m except the oral evidence of P.W.1. Therefore as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case notional income of the deceased is to be taken into consideration for calculating the quantum of compensation to the petitioners. Hence considering the age of the deceased a notional income of sum of Rs.8,500/- is taken into consideration. 23.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or the dependents of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the 10 deceased. 24.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may proceed to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 25.Considering the age of the deceased notional income of a sum of Rs.8,500/- is taken into consideration. As per the latest Judgment Reported in 2017 (2) TN MAC 609 (SC) in the case between National Insurance Company Limited … Vs..... Pranay Sethi and others 40% of the income is taken as addition. Hence 40% of the income comes to Rs.3,400/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.8,500+ Rs.3,400/- which is comes to Rs.11,900/-. Hence a sum of 11,900 /- is fixed as income of the deceased. 26.And as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 15 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court considering the marital status of the deceased 1/4 of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 27.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as follows: Hence Rs.11,900 X 12 X 15 = Rs.21,42,000/- and ¼ personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.5,35,500/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs.21,42,000 – Rs.5,35,500 = Rs.16,06,500/- 28. Further as per the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for funeral expenses, and a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for loss of estate, and a sum of Rs.40,000/- was taken for loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner. 29. On perusal of Ex.P6 it reveals that, the petitioners are also entitled for a sum of Rs.6,000/- incurred towards Medical expenditure. 11 30.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows: Sl. No. Heads Amount 1Loss of Income Rs. 16,06,500/- 2Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/- 3Funeral Expenses Rs. 15,000/- 4Loss of consortium Rs. 40,000/- 5Medical Bills Rs. 6,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.16,82,500/- From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.16,82,500/-towards compensation and the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.16,82,500/-with interest. 31.Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.8,00,000/-of claim amount, and the 2nd and 3rd petitioners are entitled each for a sum of Rs.3,50,000/- of claim amount, and the 4th petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.1,82,500/- Hence point Nos.3 & 4 are answered accordingly. In the result, the Respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.16,82,500/- with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. And out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.8,00,000/- of claim amount and the 2nd and 3rd Petitioners are entitled each for a sum of Rs.3,50,000/- of claim amount and the 4th petitioner is entitled for Rs.1,82,500/- of claim amount. After deposit, the petitioners are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount with interest immediately. The court fee of Rs.16,198/- is ordered to be paid by the Petitioners within one month. The Advocate fees is fixed at Rs.22,825/- to be paid by the respondents by a separate cheque.

ORDER The Petition is filed U/S. 166(1)(e) of the MOTOR VEHICLES ACT,1988 seeking compensation for a sum of Rs.14,00,000/-. 2 2. A VERMENTS CONTAINED IN THE PETITION :- i.The deceased Marimuthu was aged about 65 years and met with a Motor vehicle accident that occurred at Thoppamattypirivu on 06.08.2015 at about 09.15 pm. The deceased Marimuthu was about to cross from East to west direction near Thoppampattypirivu with controlled speed by driving his TVS 50 bearing Registration No.TN 38 K 7951 to reach him home. At that time of mishap 1st respondent who drove the BOLERO JEEP bearing registration No.TN 38A T9235 with a rash negligible manner with an uncontrollable speed without adhering the traffic rules and regulations from South to North direction of Coimbatore to Mettupalayam the said Jeep was run helter-skelter and dashed against the deceased Marimuthu's TVS 50 massively. As a result of which the said Marimuthu sustained grievous injuries. Immediately he was admitted in Ganga Medical Center Hospital, Coimbatore for treatment where he was died on 07.08.2015 at 02.05pm without responding the treatment. On information, Thudialur police has registered the case in Crime No.387/2015 Under Section 279 and 337 of IPC against the 1st respondent on 07.08.2015. The deceased Marimuthu was taken from Ganga Medical Centre Hospital to Coimbatore Medical College Hospital Coimbatore for conducting autopsy. At the time of accident the deceased Marimuthu was running maligai store at No.19c, Kotharinagar, Thoppampattypirivu, Vadamathurai Post, Coimbatore-17. ii.At the time of accident the petitioner was aged about 64 years and was hale and healthy. At the time of accident the deceased Marimuthu was earning Rs.15,000/-pm from the business. The 1st petitioner is the wife of the deceased the 2nd 3rd and 5th petitioners are sons of the deceased Marimuthu and are depending on his sole income, the 4th petitioner is the daughter of the deceased she has living with her husband. The deceased Marimuthu was the only bread 3 winner of the family and was shouldering the family burden. After the demise of Marimuthu 1st,2nd,3rd,4th and 5th petitioners are unable to maintain the family for day-today expenses. The petitioners are suffering under heavy financial crisis to meet out the expenses incurring for daily requirements to run the family. The welfare of the family is disturbed totally. The Love and affection on the deceased never be compensated in any means. iii.The petitioners' pain and suffering and loss of earning cannot be estimated in terms of money, the petitioners' family totally affected from the future planning. Any award of compensation never fulfill their needs and love and affection. However, the petitioners are entitled to claim the compensation of Rs.14,00,000/- though they are entitled to claim more as stated supra. iv.The 1st respondent is being a driver of the offending vehicle bearing reg.No.TN 33 AT 9235, and the 2nd respondent being a owner of the vehicle all are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 3. BRIEF A VERMENTS CONTAINED IN THE COUNTER STATEMENT FILED BY THE 1 st RESPONDENT : i.The averments stated in paragraph No.23 of the petition that the age of the deceased, nature of accident, income of the deceased are hereby denied by the 1st respondent. The petitioners are liable to prove the same. Further the 1st respondent submits that the claim amount claimed in the petition is very high and the interest claimed also very high. ii.The accident had happened only due to the rash and negligence of the deceased only. It is false to state that the 1st respondent is the main cause to the said accident. 4 iii.At the time of accident it was night time and the deceased vehicle had no head light. The deceased has no driving license. Further there is no fitness certificate in respect of the deceased vehicle. As per the FIR it was mentioned that the deceased is the owner of the vehicle which was driven by him but it is not correct. The Petitioners have not produced any R.C.Book to the M.V .Inspector. Further there is no insurance also to the vehicle driven by the Petitioner. Due to old age, at that night time, the deceased lost his balance and due to that only he fell down from his vehicle and sustained injuries. On seeing that the 1st respondent has stopped his vehicle. The 1st respondent never hit against the deceased vehicle. So he is not responsible for the accident and hence the 2nd Respondent is not liable to pay any compensation to the petitioners as claimed in the petition. In case if the petitioners are liable to get compensation, they ought to have claimed the compensation only with the owner of the vehicle which was driven by the deceased bearing registration number TN 38 K 7951 since the accident had happened due to the rash and negligence act of the deceased only. Therefore non joinder of the said owner of the TVS 50 this petition is liable to be dismissed. 4. THE POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the petition mentioned accident occurred due to the rash and negligent act of the 1st Respondent who drove the offending vehicle? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation? 3.Whether the Petitioners are entitled for compensation? 4.If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the Petitioners ? 5.On behalf of the Petitioners' side, the 3rd Petitioner was examined as PW- 1 and 20 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P20 and one Jayaraj was examined as PW-2 and Ex.P21 was marked. On behalf of the Respondents, the 5 1st Respondent was called absent and set ex-parte and on behalf of the 2nd Respondent there is no oral and as well as documentary evidence adduced. POINT NO.1:- Whether the petition mentioned accident occurred due to the rash and negligent act of the 1st Respondent who drove the offending vehicle? 6.The case of the petitioner is that on 06.08.2015 the father of the petitioner Marimuthu met with an accident at Thoppampatti pirivu, Mettupalayam road when the 1st respondent drove the BOLERO JEEP bearing Regn No.TN 33 AT 9235 with high speed and the driver as lost his control over the vehicle and because of his negligence the said jeep dashed against the TVS 50 Motor cycle bearning Regn No.TN 38 K 7951 driven by the deceased Marimuthu in East to West direction after purchasing provisions at Kothari Nagar, Thoppampatti Pirivu and while crossing Mettupalayam Road he met with the above said accident. Due to the accident the deceased sustained injuries and immediately he was taken to Ganga Medical Centre Hospital where he died on 07.08.2015 and subsequently the body was sent to Coimbatore Medical Hospital for conducting autopsy. 7.In support of their case, the petitioners are marked Ex.P1 F.I.R. dated 07.08.2015 and Ex.P2 the final report filed against the 1st respondent who is charged for the offences u/s.279, 304 (A) IPC, Ex.P3 the Observation Mahazar, Ex.P4 Rough Sketch in respect of the accident, and Ex.P7 Post-Mortem certificate of the deceased, Ex.P8 Death Certificate of the deceased and the medical bills pertaining to the treatment given to the deceased after he was admitted in the hospital. 6 8.Whereas the contention of the 2nd respondent who is the owner of the offending vehicle BOLERO JEEP bearing Regn No. TN 32 AT 9235 which was driven by the 1st respondent, at the time of accident is that it was dark and the vehicle in which the deceased was riding has no head Lamp due to which the accident had occurred. Further case of the 2nd respondent is that without any proper driving License and without fitness certificate of the vehicle the deceased has driven his vehicle. It is false to state that the deceased is not owner of the vehicle in which he was riding, therefore due to the old age the deceased has lost his balance and as it was dark in the night he fell down from his vehicle and sustained injuries. On noticing that the 1st respondent has stopped his vehicle and he has not hit against the deceased vehicle as alleged by the petitioners. Therefore, the driver of the offending vehicle is not responsible for the accident and hence, the 2nd respondent as owner of the offending vehicle is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners as claimed by them. If at all, the petitioners are entitled for any compensation they have to claim it with the owner of the vehicle in which the deceased was riding bearing Registration No.TN 38 K 7951. 9.On considering both side rival contentions it is evident that the accident is not disputed and the death of Marimuthu is also not disputed. Therefore it is to be seen whether the vehicle driven by the 1st Respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and hit the vehicle of the deceased and caused the accident. 10.In support of their claim the Petitioners have examined one Jayaraj who is the eye witness of the accident occurred on 06.08.2015. In his chief examination he would depose that on 06.08.2015 at about 08.55 P.M. when he was standing in a Bakery at Mettupalayam Road and was having Tea he saw the offending vehicle bearing Regn NO. TN 33 AT 9235 BOLERO GEEP hit the TVS 50 in which the deceased was riding. Immediately he rushed to the spot and informed 7 PW-1 the son of the deceased. Thereafter, he was shifted to Ganga Medical Centre for treatment. 11.Though in the chief examination he would depose that he saw the offending vehicle driven by the 1st Respondent hit the vehicle of the deceased however, during cross examination he would depose that he did not notice the offending vehicle from where it was proceeding and after hearing the sound only he saw the accident and went to the spot. 12.Though the 1st Respondent would contend that the deceased lost control over the vehicle and fell down and on seeing him fell down he stopped his vehicle and not hit him; on perusal of Ex.P6 MVI Report in respect of the offending vehicle it is evident that the offending vehicle was damaged in the front right side of the vehicle at the time of inspection. Though the 1st Respondnet would contend that without license and without head lamp in the vehicle the deceased had driven his vehicle absolutely no matierisl to show that because of that the deceased has also contributed to the accident. 13.Further on perusal of Ex.P5 report submitted by the Motor Vehicles Inspector, it is evident that the Motor cycle bearing Regn NO. TN 38 K 7951 driven by the deceased was owned by one S.Ravikumar, S/o.Swaminathan. Further at the time of inspection the driving license of the deceased was not produced. Similarly no insurance policy was not produced to the Motor Vehicle Inspector. It is also to be noted that in Ex.P5 MV Inspector has categorically stated in respect of efficiency of foot brake that the vehicle in which the deceased was riding was not in a running condition however, he has opined that the accident was not due to any mechanical defects found at the time of inspection. Further the MV inspector has not stated anything about the non 8 functioning of the head lamp in the vehicle. 14.Admittedly, the 1st respondent is the driver of the offending vehicle and there is no dispute in this regard. Similarly there is no dispute regarding the accident occurred on 06.08.2015 and the offending vehicle was involved in the accident. Further Charge sheet is laid against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s.279, 304 (A) of IPC; in addition to that there is no contra evidence available on the part of the 1st Respondent that the deceased also contributed to the accident. And hence this court holds that the 1st respondent alone has hit the vehicle of the deceased and caused the accident. Thus the Point No.1 is answered as against the 1st Respondent. POINT NO.2:- Who is liable to pay compensation? 15.Admittedly the offending vehicle was driven by the 1st Respondent and the 2n Respondent is the owner of that vehicle. Similarly there is no dispute regarding the accident occurred on 06.08.2015 and the offending vehicle was involved in the accident. Likewise there is also no dispute that the 1st Respondent is the employee of the 2nd Respondent. Hence as owner of the offending vehicle vicariously the 2nd Respondent is liable to pay compensation to the Petitioners. POINT NO.3:- Whether the Petitioners are entitled for compensation? 16.The contention of the Petitioners is that the 1st Petitioner is the wife of the deceased and the other Petitioners are the sons and daughter of the deceased 9 Marimuthu. In order to prove the same the Petitioners have marked the death certificate and the legal heir certificate as Ex.P8 and Ex.P9 and there is no contra evidence available on this regard. Therefore this court has no hesitation to hold that the Petitioners are entitled for compensation. POINT NO.4:- If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the Petitioners ? 17.The contention of the Petitioner is the at the time of accident the Deceased was aged about 64 years and was hale and healthy and at the time of accident he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/-pm from his business. All the Petitioners were depending upon the income of the deceased alone. The deceased alone was the only bread winner of the family and he was taking care of the entire family. Due to his sudden demise the Petitioners find it difficult to maintain the family and the day-to-day expenses. The Petitioners are suffering under heavy financial crisis to meet out the expenses. The welfare of the entire family is shattered. The love and affection on the deceased never be compensated in any means. The pain and sufferings and loss of earning cannot be estimated in terms of money. Any award of compensation never fulfill their needs and love and affection. 18.Though the Petitioners have contended that the deceased was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- pm no documentary proof is filed by them in support of their case. On perusal of Ex.P7 Post Mortem report no adverse remarks made against the deceased. 19.This court has carefully gone through the available material on hand. The accident and the death of deceased are not disputed by the 2nd Respondent and 10 the 2nd Respondent remained absent and set ex-parte. Further no adverse remarks found in the post mortem certificate. Further no evidence is available to show that the deceased also contributed to the accident. Therefore, as there is no contra evident available on the part of the 2nd Respondent that the deceased also contributed to the negligence the contention of the 1st Respondent cannot be countenanced with as the contention of the 1st Respondent is vague and usual defence raised. 20.Now with regard to the quantum of compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives are the dependents of the deceased. The compensation should commensurate to the loss of defense suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 21.In a given case, if the claim case so exorbitant if the claim is made out ground layout the tribunal may not accept the claim and may proceed to determine the possible income by resorting to some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the relevant point of time depending on the facts and circumstances of the each case. 22.Now coming to the quantum of compensation to be paid as stated earlier the Petitioners have not adduced any evidence both oral as well as documentary evidence considering the age of the deceased at the time of the accident the income of the deceased is to be guesstimated according to the given circumstances of the case. 11 23.The above said view of this court is well supported by the decision of the Apex Court reported in 2014(1) TNMAC 459 (SC) 2014(2) SCC 735 Syed Saliq vs divisional manager, united India insurance company limited. The above judgment would categorically rule that there cannot be positive evidence for a person who is working in an unorganized sector or doing his own business and hence the court has to guesstimate the monthly income going by the present state of economy and the rising prices. 24.In the present case, the age of the deceased is 64 years and the income is fixed as Rs.5,000/-. By applying the Multiplier as per the dictum laid down by the Apex court in Sarala Varma case the Multiplier is 7 which is the proper multiplier for assessing the income of the deceased. As per the law laid down in Sarala Varma case half of the amount is to be deducted for personal expenses. Considering the age of the deceased and in view of the dictum laid down by the apex court 1/4th of the total income is deducted for personal expenses of the deceased. 25.The Honourable Supreme Court had held that the wife is entitled for consortium to the extent of Rs.1,00,000/- Honourable Supreme Court in 2013 ACJ 1403 Rajesh and Others V Rajbir Singh in Para 20 held as follows: “20. We may therefore, revisit the practice of awarding compensation under conventional heads, Loss of Consortium to the spouse, Loss of Love, care and guidance to children and Funeral Expenses. It may be noted that the sum of Rs.2,500/- to Rs.10,000/- in those heads was fixed several decades ago and having regard to inflation factor, the some needs to be increased. In Sarla Varma's case (supra), it was held that Compensation for Loss of Consortium should be in the range of Rs.5,000/- to Rs.10,000/- In legal parlance, 12 'consortium' is the right of the spouse to the Company, care, help, comfort, guidance, society, solace, affection and sexual relations with his or her mate. That non-pecuniary head of damages has not been properly understood by our Courts. The Loss of Companionship, Love, Care and Protection, etc., the spouse is entitled to get, has to be compensated appropriately. The Concept of Non- Pecuniary Damage for Loss of Consortium' is one of the major head of award of Compensation in other parts of the world more particularly in the United States of America, Australia, etc., English Courts have also recognized the right of a spouse to get Compensation even during the period of temporary disablement. By Loss of Consortium, the Courts have made an attempt to compensate the loss of spouse's affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations during the future years. Unlike the Compensation awarded in other countries and other jurisdictions, since the Legal Heirs are otherwise adequately compensated for the Pecuniary Loss,it would not be proper to award a major amount under the head. Hence, we are of the view that it would only be just and reasonable that the Courts award at least rupees one lakh for Loss of Consortium”. and following above judgment, in the present case, considering the age of the deceased, this court holds that the 1st petitioner being the wife is entitled to a sum of Rs.50,000/-. 26.Apart from the above the Petitioners have also marked the medical bills pertaining to the treatment given to the deceased which comes to a sum of Rs.87,945/-. It is rounder off Rs.88,000/- 27.As such the calculation of loss of income can be calculated as follows ; The monthly income of the deceased is fixed as Rs.5,000 /-; 13 The income of the deceased is Rs.5,000/- and the multiplier is 7 and as such 5000 x 12 x 7= 4,20,000/- Personal expenses is to be deducted as 1/4th which comes to Rs.4,20,000/- /4 = Rs.1,05,000/- = Rs.3,15,000/- Sl.No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs. 3,15,000/- 2 Medical Expenses (Rounded Off) Rs. 88,000/- 3 Loss of Consortium Rs. 50,000/- 4 Loss of Love and Affection Rs. 50,000/- 5 Funeral Expenses Rs. 20,000/- 6 Damages to clothing Rs. 2,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs. 5,25,000/- 28. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.3,25,000/- of claim amount and the other petitioners are each entitled for a sum of Rs.50,000/- of claim amount. In the result , the 2nd Respondent is liable to pay a sum of Rs.5,25,000/- with interest to the petitioners, at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with cost within three months. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.3,25,000/- with interest, 14 and the petitioners 2 to 5 are each entitled for a sum of Rs.50,000/- with interest. After deposit, the petitioners 1 to 5 are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount immediately. The court fee of Rs.4622.50- is ordered to be paid by the petitioners within 15 days. The Advocate fees is fixed at Rs.12,250/- to be paid by the 2nd respondent by a separate cheque.

Hence, the Thudialur Police Station has a filed a criminal case in Crime.No.416/2015 u/s.279, 334, and 304 (A) IPC against the respondent and the same is pending before the Ld Judicial Magistrate No.1, Coimbatore. iii.At the time of accident, the deceased M.Rajagopal was aged about 23 years and he was working as Lorry Driver and earning monthly around Rs.9,000/- p.m. thereby the deceased M.Rajagopal, maintaining himself and his wife vis., 1st petitioner his minor daughter as 2nd petitioner, the parents of the 3rd and 4th petitioners. The sudden death of the deceased M.Rajagopal placed the petitioners in doll-drum and to suffer very lot both financially and mentally. Due to the death of the deceased M.Rajagopal, presently petitioners are engulfed and trapped by the burden of debts arising out of livelihood and maintaining the petitioners to answer the question of the survival. The 3 Petitioners are just like fish out of water due to the sudden death of deceased M.Ragagoapl. iv.The respondent is the driver cum owner of the offending vehicle BAJAJ scooter bearing Registration No.TN B 4405 at the time of accident. The said vehicle which involved in the accident was not insured at the time of accident. Therefore, the respondent is the only liable to pay the compensation the the petitioner. 3. BRIEF A VERMENT CONTAINED IN THE COUNTER :- i.It is categorically false to aver that on 16.08.2015 at about 12.00 hrs, the deceased M.Rajagopal was riding his motor cycle HONDA SHINE bearing Registration No.TN 38 BY 2135, very slowly and carefully proceeding from south to north, at VMT Nagar junction, nearly lorry Association Oil Company, Thadagam Road, Coimbatore at that time the respondent driven by his vehicle BAJAJ scooter bearing Registration No.TN B 4405 proceeding from north to south in a rash and negligent manner without giving any signal and suddenly turned the right side of the road and dashed against the deceased M.Rajagopal's motorcycle. It is false to aver that the accident was happened due to the violation of the basic rules by the Respondent. It is false to aver that at the time of accident the deceased was aged about 23 years and he was working as lorry driver and earning monthly around Rs.9,000/- p.m. The rest of the allegations made in the petition in support of the petitioners' case are distorting one and self-explanatory. ii.On 16.08.2015 at about 01.00 P.M. the Respondent drove the scooter along with his 2 years old granddaughter, who stood in front of the scooter, on the Kovai to Thadagam road, from north to south direction at a moderate speed, cautious manner and adhering the traffic rules and regulations and nearing Lorry Association Oil Company, in order to VMT Nagar, he further reduced speed and gave indicator and proper hand signal, then swerved towards right side and almost crossed ¾ portion and 4 also reached at pirivu road. At that time, one Honda Bike, bearing Registration No.TN 38 BY 2135 came from south to north direction, driven by the deceased M.Rajagopal, in a rash and negligent manner, without adhering the traffic rules and regulations and also inebriated condition , in the result of which hit at left middle of the scooter. Due to that, the respondent and his granddaughter were thrown off to some distance about 10 feet and fell down. Due to impact this respondent became unconscious condition. iii.After a while, the respondent's son came to the scene of occurrence and the respondent and his granddaughter were brought to Ganga Hospital, Coimbatore where this respondent underwent treatment 1-1/2 months as inpatient at Intensive Care Unit due to life endanger injuries and till date this respondent has not completely cured. His granddaughter has also sustained grievous injuries at leg, hand, and head for which took treatment more than 4 months at Ganga Hospital. This respondent spent Rs.15,00,000/- towards medical expenses for himself and his granddaughter. iv.The respondent's vehicle model is 1978 and this respondent service maintained properly, thereby it is good condition at the time of accident and too, its speed is below 30 K.M. and the respondent aged about 67 years old and he took his granddaughter in front of scooter drove his scooter in dead slow. While the real fact is so, for the only one reason as rider of motorcycle, Rajagopal died, 3rd petitioner, Manikandan lodged false complaint against this respondent in order to get wrongful gain from this respondent with influence of police officials. But the deceased was drove the above said motorcycle in drunken condition and he has kept two quarter Alcohol Bottles in his motorcycles tank cover which was well known to (1)Vijayakumar, Kanuvai, (2) Shanmugam, Sanjeevi Nagar, (3) Manjula, VMT Nagar, (4) Jayakumar. VSK Nagar, (5) Arusamy, Kanuvai and (6) Karthikeyan, Pannimadai who all were at the scene of occurrence and real fact at the time of 5 accident. As this respondent and his granddaughter have sustained grievous injuries, became unconscious condition and took treatment as inpatient, taking advantage the respondent's condition. The father of the deceased, 3rd petitioner herein, has lodged false complaint to the police and suppressed the real fact and filed this frivolous petition. In fact, the accident occurred only due to rash and negligent driving with inebriated condition of deceased, thereby the deceased is alone responsible for the said accident. There is no fault on the part of the respondent. Under the above said circumstances the petitioners are not entitled to claim any compensation from the respondent and totally liable to be rejected in limini. 4. POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the respondent has drove the offending vehicle Bajaj Scooter bearing Registration No. TN B 4405 on 16.08.2015 in a rash and negligent manner ? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation ? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 5.On behalf of the petitioners, 1st petitioner was examined as PW-1 and Ex.P1 to Ex.P15 was marked. 6.As the Respondent failed to cross examine PW-1 he was called absent set ex-parte. Therefore, the arguments of the petitioners and perused the entire records. POINT No.1:- 7.The case of the petitioners is that on 16.08.2015 at about 12.00 hrs the deceased M.Rajagopal was riding his Motor cycle 'HONDA SHINE' bearing Registration No.TN 38 BY 2135 very slowly and carefully proceeding from south to north direction. When he was proceeding in the road, at VMT Nagar junction near 6 lorry Association Oil Company, Thadagam Road, Coimbatore, at that time the respondent who was riding a BAJAJ Scooter bearing Registration No. TN B 4405, proceeding from north to south in a rash and negligent manner without giving any signal and suddenly turned the right side of the road and dashed against the deceased M.Rajagopal's Motor cycle owing to that deceased fall on the road along with his motor cycle and sustained grievous head injuries and all over the body. Immediately the petitioner was taken to CMC Hospital, Coimbatore through 108 Ambulance. Where the medical officers referred with the deceased and informed that M.Rajagopal was died on the way itself. 8.Further case of the petitioners is that the above said accident was happened as the Respondent has violated the basic rule. Hence, the Thudialur Police Station has a filed a criminal case in Crime.No.416/2015 u/s.279, 334, and 304 (A) IPC against the respondent who was the driver cum owner of the said vehicle BAJAJ scooter bearing Registration No. TN B 4405 and the same is pending before the Ld Judicial Magistrate No.1, Coimbatore. 9.Further case of the petitioners is that at the time of accident, the deceased M.Rajagopal was aged about 23 years and he was working as Lorry Driver and earning monthly around Rs.9,000/- p.m. thereby the deceased M.Rajagopal, maintaining himself and his wife vis., 1st petitioner his minor daughter as 2nd petitioner, the parents 3rd and 4th petitioners. The sudden death of the deceased M.Rajagopal placed the petitioners in doll-drum and to suffer very lot both financially and mentally. Due to the death of the deceased M.Rajagopal, presently petitioners are engulfed and trapped by the burden of debts arising out of livelihood and maintaining the petitioners to answer the question of the survival. The Petitioners are just like fish out of water due to the sudden death of deceased M.Ragagoapl. 7 10.Further case of the petitioners is that the respondent is the driver cum owner of the offending vehicle BAJAJ scooter bearing Registration No.TN B 4405 at the time of accident. The said vehicle which involved in the accident was not insured at the time of accident. Therefore, the respondent is the only liable to pay the compensation the petitioner. 11.Whereas the contention of the respondent is that it is categorically false to aver that on 16.08.2015 at about 12.00 hrs, the deceased M.Rajagopal was riding his motor cycle HONDA SHINE bearing Registration No.TN 38 BY 2135, very slowly and carefully proceeding from south to north at Thadagam Road, Coimbatore. The Respondent would also contend that due to the negligence act of the deceased alone the accident took place and because of the accident he and his granddaughter sustained injuries and he was hospitalized for more than one month and spent huge amount of Rs.15,00,000/-. Further the Respondent would contend that the deceased has driven his vehicle in a drunken manner and he also carried two liquor bottles with him at the time of the accident and hence contended that the deceased alone is solely responsible for the accident. However in-order to gain money from the Respondent the 3rd Petitioner has lodge a criminal complaint against the Respondent. 12.On perusal of Ex.P1 FIR, Ex.P2 final report it is filed as against the Respondent and he was charged for the offences U/s.279, 304 (A) IPC. Likewise on perusal of Ex.P5 it is evident the vehicle of the Respondent is also not insured and no fitness certificate was produced before the vehicle Inspector. Of course with a valid license he has driven the vehicle. 13.Similarly on perusal of Ex.P4 it is evident that the vehicle in which the deceased was riding was not insured and Fitness certificate was also not produced before the Vehicle Inspector. However there is no iota of evidence to show that the deceased also contributed to the accident. Admittedly as per the MV report the 8 accident was not due to any mechanical defect of the vehicle of the deceased. 14.On perusal of Ex.P6 Post-mortem report the doctor has opined that the deceased would have died of his head injury. Apart from that no adverse remark is found place in the certificate as claimed by the Respondent. 15.Though the respondent filed his counter disputing the claim of petitioner however failed to cross examine PW-1 in respect of her claim. As there is no contra evidence available as against the claim of the Petitioners and having regard to the fact that the Petitioners have prima facie proved their claim considering the nature and circumstance of the case this court is of the considered view that the Respondent is liable to pay the compensation. 16.Now with regard to the quantum of compensation a s already stated the accident and death of the deceased are not disputed by the Respondent and no adverse remarks found in the Post Mortem certificate. Therefore as there is no contra evidence on the part of the Respondent that the deceased also contributed to the negligence the contention of the Respondent cannot be countenanced with as it is a vague and usual defence raised. 17.Further it should be bear in mind that t he object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or dependent of the deceased. The compensation should commensurate to the loss of dependency suffered by the legal representatives. Therefore it should be just and reasonable, proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 18.Though the petitioner has contended that the deceased Rajagopal has working 9 as Lorry Driver and was earning a sum of Rs.9,000/-, she has not filed any documentary proof to establish her claim. Further she is also not examined anybody in this regard. 19.However, on perusal of Ex.P4 MVI report submitted by the petitioner it appears that the deceased was in possession of the valid driving license, therefore though no document is filed to prove that he was employed as a driver and was earning Rs.9000/- p.m. at least the petitioner is able to establish the her deceased husband knew driving and was in possession of valid driving license. 20.In a given case, if the claim made is so exorbitant or if the claim made is contrary to ground realities, the Tribunal may not accept the claim and may proceed to determine the possible income by resorting to some guess work, which may include the ground realities prevailing at the relevant point of time. It depends on the facts of each case. Therefore on perusal of the entire evidence and upon the settled law this court is of the considered view that income can be guesstimated and the monthly income is fixed at Rs.3,000/-pm. 21.The sufferings and sorrows, mental agonies and hard ship that are undergone by the petitioners cannot be compensated by any means or kinds and they are incapable of mere monetary measures of calculations. However, they should be compensated to the extent to which they are practically possible in this material. On perusal of Ex.P7 death certificate the age of the deceased is mentioned that 23 years. The petitioner has marked Ex.P8 Legal Heir-ship certificate in order to prove that the petitioners are LRs of the deceased Rajagopal. Therefore upon the settled law on this point this court is of the considered view that income can be calculated and by applying the Multiplier as per the dictum laid down by the Apex court in Sarala Varma case the Multiplier is 18 which is the proper multiplier for assessing the income of the deceased. 10 22.With regard to the claim of consortium the Hono’ble Supreme Court in the case between Rajesh and Others V Rajbir Singh reported in 2013 ACJ 1403 had held that the wife is entitled for consortium to the extent of Rs.1,00,000/-. For better appreciation the relevant paragraph is reproduced below for better understanding. “20. We may therefore, revisit the practice of awarding compensation under conventional heads, Loss of Consortium to the spouse, Loss of Love, care and guidance to children and Funeral Expenses. It may be noted that the sum of Rs.2,500/- to Rs.10,000/- in those heads was fixed several decades ago and having regard to inflation factor, the some needs to be increased. In Sarla Varma's case (supra), it was held that Compensation for Loss of Consortium should be in the range of Rs.5,000/- to Rs.10,000/- In legal parlance, 'consortium' is the right of the spouse to the Company, care, help, comfort, guidance, society, solace, affection and sexual relations with his or her mate. That non-pecuniary head of damages has not been properly understood by our Courts. The Loss of Companionship, Love, Care and Protection, etc., the spouse is entitled to get, has to be compensated appropriately. The Concept of Non- Pecuniary Damage for Loss of Consortium' is one of the major head of award of Compensation in other parts of the world more particularly in the United States of America, Australia, etc., English Courts have also recognized the right of a spouse to get Compensation even during the period of temporary disablement. By Loss of Consortium, the Courts have made an attempt to compensate the loss of spouse's affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations during the future years. Unlike the Compensation awarded in other countries and other jurisdictions, since the Legal Heirs are otherwise adequately compensated for the Pecuniary Loss,it 11 would not be proper to award a major amount under the head. Hence, we are of the view that it would only be just and reasonable that the Courts award at least rupees one lakh for Loss of Consortium”. and following above judgment, in the present case, considering the age of the deceased, I hold that the 1st petitioner being the wife is entitled to a sum of Rs.1,00,000/-. 23.By applying the Multiplier as per the dictum laid down by the Apex court in Sarala Varma case the Multiplier is 18 which is the proper multiplier for assessing the income of the deceased. As per the law laid down in Sarala Varma case 1/4 of the amount is to be deducted for personal expenses. Considering the age of the deceased and in view of the dictum laid down by the apex court 1/4th of the total income is deducted for personal expenses of the deceased. As such the calculation of loss of income can be calculated as follows; Loss of income of deceased is Rs. 3,000/- and Multiplier is 18, future prospectus 1,500/- total 4,500/-and Personal expenses to be deducted is ¼. As such Rs.4,500 X 12 X 18 = Rs.9,72,000/- Rs.9,72,000 – Rs.2,43,000/- = Rs.7,29,000/- 1. Loss of Income -Rs.7,29,000/- 2. Love and Affection -Rs. 1,00,000/- 3. Loss of consortium -Rs. 1,00,000/- 4. Transportation from hospital -Rs. 1,000/- 5. Damages to clothing & articles -Rs. 2,000/- ----------------- Total -Rs.9,32,000/- ----------------- 12 24.As already held the Respondent is liable to pay the compensation as fixed above and hence Point No.1 to 3 are answered accordingly. 25.Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.3,00,000/- and the 2nd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.2,32,000/- and the 3rd and 4th Petitioners are entitled for a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- each and hence Point No.3 is answered accordingly. In the result, the Respondent is liable to pay a sum of Rs.9,32,000/- with interest to the petitioners at the rate of 6% per annum, from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.3,00,000/- with interest, and the 2nd petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.2,32,000/- with interest and the 3rd and 4th Petitioners are entitled for a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- each with interest. After deposit, the 1st petitioner is permitted to withdraw half of her share immediately and the balance Rs.1,50,000/- with interest of her share is to be deposited in any nationalized bank for three years and with regard to the share of the minor 2nd Petitioner is concerned it shall be deposited in any nationalized bank till she attains her majority and the 3rd and 4th Petitioners are permitted to withdraw their entire amount with interest. The court fee of Rs.8692.50- is ordered to be paid by the petitioners within 15 days. The Advocate fees is fixed at Rs.16,320/- to be paid by the Respondent by a separate cheque.

BRIEF A VERMENTS CONTAINED IN THE COUNTER STATEMENT FILED BY THE 1 st RESPONDENT : i.The averments stated in paragraph No.23 of the petition that the age of the deceased, nature of accident, income of the deceased are hereby denied by the 1st respondent. The petitioners are liable to prove the same. Further the 1st respondent submits that the claim amount claimed in the petition is very high and the interest claimed also very high. ii.The accident had happened only due to the rash and negligence of the deceased only. It is false to state that the 1st respondent is the main cause to the said accident. 4 iii.At the time of accident it was night time and the deceased vehicle had no head light. The deceased has no driving license. Further there is no fitness certificate in respect of the deceased vehicle. As per the FIR it was mentioned that the deceased is the owner of the vehicle which was driven by him but it is not correct. The Petitioners have not produced any R.C.Book to the M.V .Inspector. Further there is no insurance also to the vehicle driven by the Petitioner. Due to old age, at that night time, the deceased lost his balance and due to that only he fell down from his vehicle and sustained injuries. On seeing that the 1st respondent has stopped his vehicle. The 1st respondent never hit against the deceased vehicle. So he is not responsible for the accident and hence the 2nd Respondent is not liable to pay any compensation to the petitioners as claimed in the petition. In case if the petitioners are liable to get compensation, they ought to have claimed the compensation only with the owner of the vehicle which was driven by the deceased bearing registration number TN 38 K 7951 since the accident had happened due to the rash and negligence act of the deceased only. Therefore non joinder of the said owner of the TVS 50 this petition is liable to be dismissed. 4. THE POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the petition mentioned accident occurred due to the rash and negligent act of the 1st Respondent who drove the offending vehicle? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation? 3.Whether the Petitioners are entitled for compensation? 4.If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the Petitioners ? 5.On behalf of the Petitioners' side, the 3rd Petitioner was examined as PW- 1 and 20 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P20 and one Jayaraj was examined as PW-2 and Ex.P21 was marked. On behalf of the Respondents, the 5 1st Respondent was called absent and set ex-parte and on behalf of the 2nd Respondent there is no oral and as well as documentary evidence adduced. POINT NO.1:- Whether the petition mentioned accident occurred due to the rash and negligent act of the 1st Respondent who drove the offending vehicle? 6.The case of the petitioner is that on 06.08.2015 the father of the petitioner Marimuthu met with an accident at Thoppampatti pirivu, Mettupalayam road when the 1st respondent drove the BOLERO JEEP bearing Regn No.TN 33 AT 9235 with high speed and the driver as lost his control over the vehicle and because of his negligence the said jeep dashed against the TVS 50 Motor cycle bearning Regn No.TN 38 K 7951 driven by the deceased Marimuthu in East to West direction after purchasing provisions at Kothari Nagar, Thoppampatti Pirivu and while crossing Mettupalayam Road he met with the above said accident. Due to the accident the deceased sustained injuries and immediately he was taken to Ganga Medical Centre Hospital where he died on 07.08.2015 and subsequently the body was sent to Coimbatore Medical Hospital for conducting autopsy. 7.In support of their case, the petitioners are marked Ex.P1 F.I.R. dated 07.08.2015 and Ex.P2 the final report filed against the 1st respondent who is charged for the offences u/s.279, 304 (A) IPC, Ex.P3 the Observation Mahazar, Ex.P4 Rough Sketch in respect of the accident, and Ex.P7 Post-Mortem certificate of the deceased, Ex.P8 Death Certificate of the deceased and the medical bills pertaining to the treatment given to the deceased after he was admitted in the hospital. 6 8.Whereas the contention of the 2nd respondent who is the owner of the offending vehicle BOLERO JEEP bearing Regn No. TN 32 AT 9235 which was driven by the 1st respondent, at the time of accident is that it was dark and the vehicle in which the deceased was riding has no head Lamp due to which the accident had occurred. Further case of the 2nd respondent is that without any proper driving License and without fitness certificate of the vehicle the deceased has driven his vehicle. It is false to state that the deceased is not owner of the vehicle in which he was riding, therefore due to the old age the deceased has lost his balance and as it was dark in the night he fell down from his vehicle and sustained injuries. On noticing that the 1st respondent has stopped his vehicle and he has not hit against the deceased vehicle as alleged by the petitioners. Therefore, the driver of the offending vehicle is not responsible for the accident and hence, the 2nd respondent as owner of the offending vehicle is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners as claimed by them. If at all, the petitioners are entitled for any compensation they have to claim it with the owner of the vehicle in which the deceased was riding bearing Registration No.TN 38 K 7951. 9.On considering both side rival contentions it is evident that the accident is not disputed and the death of Marimuthu is also not disputed. Therefore it is to be seen whether the vehicle driven by the 1st Respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and hit the vehicle of the deceased and caused the accident. 10.In support of their claim the Petitioners have examined one Jayaraj who is the eye witness of the accident occurred on 06.08.2015. In his chief examination he would depose that on 06.08.2015 at about 08.55 P.M. when he was standing in a Bakery at Mettupalayam Road and was having Tea he saw the offending vehicle bearing Regn NO. TN 33 AT 9235 BOLERO GEEP hit the TVS 50 in which the deceased was riding. Immediately he rushed to the spot and informed 7 PW-1 the son of the deceased. Thereafter, he was shifted to Ganga Medical Centre for treatment. 11.Though in the chief examination he would depose that he saw the offending vehicle driven by the 1st Respondent hit the vehicle of the deceased however, during cross examination he would depose that he did not notice the offending vehicle from where it was proceeding and after hearing the sound only he saw the accident and went to the spot. 12.Though the 1st Respondent would contend that the deceased lost control over the vehicle and fell down and on seeing him fell down he stopped his vehicle and not hit him; on perusal of Ex.P6 MVI Report in respect of the offending vehicle it is evident that the offending vehicle was damaged in the front right side of the vehicle at the time of inspection. Though the 1st Respondnet would contend that without license and without head lamp in the vehicle the deceased had driven his vehicle absolutely no matierisl to show that because of that the deceased has also contributed to the accident. 13.Further on perusal of Ex.P5 report submitted by the Motor Vehicles Inspector, it is evident that the Motor cycle bearing Regn NO. TN 38 K 7951 driven by the deceased was owned by one S.Ravikumar, S/o.Swaminathan. Further at the time of inspection the driving license of the deceased was not produced. Similarly no insurance policy was not produced to the Motor Vehicle Inspector. It is also to be noted that in Ex.P5 MV Inspector has categorically stated in respect of efficiency of foot brake that the vehicle in which the deceased was riding was not in a running condition however, he has opined that the accident was not due to any mechanical defects found at the time of inspection. Further the MV inspector has not stated anything about the non 8 functioning of the head lamp in the vehicle. 14.Admittedly, the 1st respondent is the driver of the offending vehicle and there is no dispute in this regard. Similarly there is no dispute regarding the accident occurred on 06.08.2015 and the offending vehicle was involved in the accident. Further Charge sheet is laid against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s.279, 304 (A) of IPC; in addition to that there is no contra evidence available on the part of the 1st Respondent that the deceased also contributed to the accident. And hence this court holds that the 1st respondent alone has hit the vehicle of the deceased and caused the accident. Thus the Point No.1 is answered as against the 1st Respondent. POINT NO.2:- Who is liable to pay compensation? 15.Admittedly the offending vehicle was driven by the 1st Respondent and the 2n Respondent is the owner of that vehicle. Similarly there is no dispute regarding the accident occurred on 06.08.2015 and the offending vehicle was involved in the accident. Likewise there is also no dispute that the 1st Respondent is the employee of the 2nd Respondent. Hence as owner of the offending vehicle vicariously the 2nd Respondent is liable to pay compensation to the Petitioners. POINT NO.3:- Whether the Petitioners are entitled for compensation? 16.The contention of the Petitioners is that the 1st Petitioner is the wife of the deceased and the other Petitioners are the sons and daughter of the deceased 9 Marimuthu. In order to prove the same the Petitioners have marked the death certificate and the legal heir certificate as Ex.P8 and Ex.P9 and there is no contra evidence available on this regard. Therefore this court has no hesitation to hold that the Petitioners are entitled for compensation. POINT NO.4:- If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the Petitioners ? 17.The contention of the Petitioner is the at the time of accident the Deceased was aged about 64 years and was hale and healthy and at the time of accident he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/-pm from his business. All the Petitioners were depending upon the income of the deceased alone. The deceased alone was the only bread winner of the family and he was taking care of the entire family. Due to his sudden demise the Petitioners find it difficult to maintain the family and the day-to-day expenses. The Petitioners are suffering under heavy financial crisis to meet out the expenses. The welfare of the entire family is shattered. The love and affection on the deceased never be compensated in any means. The pain and sufferings and loss of earning cannot be estimated in terms of money. Any award of compensation never fulfill their needs and love and affection. 18.Though the Petitioners have contended that the deceased was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- pm no documentary proof is filed by them in support of their case. On perusal of Ex.P7 Post Mortem report no adverse remarks made against the deceased. 19.This court has carefully gone through the available material on hand. The accident and the death of deceased are not disputed by the 2nd Respondent and 10 the 2nd Respondent remained absent and set ex-parte. Further no adverse remarks found in the post mortem certificate. Further no evidence is available to show that the deceased also contributed to the accident. Therefore, as there is no contra evident available on the part of the 2nd Respondent that the deceased also contributed to the negligence the contention of the 1st Respondent cannot be countenanced with as the contention of the 1st Respondent is vague and usual defence raised. 20.Now with regard to the quantum of compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives are the dependents of the deceased. The compensation should commensurate to the loss of defense suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 21.In a given case, if the claim case so exorbitant if the claim is made out ground layout the tribunal may not accept the claim and may proceed to determine the possible income by resorting to some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the relevant point of time depending on the facts and circumstances of the each case. 22.Now coming to the quantum of compensation to be paid as stated earlier the Petitioners have not adduced any evidence both oral as well as documentary evidence considering the age of the deceased at the time of the accident the income of the deceased is to be guesstimated according to the given circumstances of the case. 11 23.The above said view of this court is well supported by the decision of the Apex Court reported in 2014(1) TNMAC 459 (SC) 2014(2) SCC 735 Syed Saliq vs divisional manager, united India insurance company limited. The above judgment would categorically rule that there cannot be positive evidence for a person who is working in an unorganized sector or doing his own business and hence the court has to guesstimate the monthly income going by the present state of economy and the rising prices. 24.In the present case, the age of the deceased is 64 years and the income is fixed as Rs.5,000/-. By applying the Multiplier as per the dictum laid down by the Apex court in Sarala Varma case the Multiplier is 7 which is the proper multiplier for assessing the income of the deceased. As per the law laid down in Sarala Varma case half of the amount is to be deducted for personal expenses. Considering the age of the deceased and in view of the dictum laid down by the apex court 1/4th of the total income is deducted for personal expenses of the deceased. 25.The Honourable Supreme Court had held that the wife is entitled for consortium to the extent of Rs.1,00,000/- Honourable Supreme Court in 2013 ACJ 1403 Rajesh and Others V Rajbir Singh in Para 20 held as follows: “20. We may therefore, revisit the practice of awarding compensation under conventional heads, Loss of Consortium to the spouse, Loss of Love, care and guidance to children and Funeral Expenses. It may be noted that the sum of Rs.2,500/- to Rs.10,000/- in those heads was fixed several decades ago and having regard to inflation factor, the some needs to be increased. In Sarla Varma's case (supra), it was held that Compensation for Loss of Consortium should be in the range of Rs.5,000/- to Rs.10,000/- In legal parlance, 12 'consortium' is the right of the spouse to the Company, care, help, comfort, guidance, society, solace, affection and sexual relations with his or her mate. That non-pecuniary head of damages has not been properly understood by our Courts. The Loss of Companionship, Love, Care and Protection, etc., the spouse is entitled to get, has to be compensated appropriately. The Concept of Non- Pecuniary Damage for Loss of Consortium' is one of the major head of award of Compensation in other parts of the world more particularly in the United States of America, Australia, etc., English Courts have also recognized the right of a spouse to get Compensation even during the period of temporary disablement. By Loss of Consortium, the Courts have made an attempt to compensate the loss of spouse's affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations during the future years. Unlike the Compensation awarded in other countries and other jurisdictions, since the Legal Heirs are otherwise adequately compensated for the Pecuniary Loss,it would not be proper to award a major amount under the head. Hence, we are of the view that it would only be just and reasonable that the Courts award at least rupees one lakh for Loss of Consortium”. and following above judgment, in the present case, considering the age of the deceased, this court holds that the 1st petitioner being the wife is entitled to a sum of Rs.50,000/-. 26.Apart from the above the Petitioners have also marked the medical bills pertaining to the treatment given to the deceased which comes to a sum of Rs.87,945/-. It is rounder off Rs.88,000/- 27.As such the calculation of loss of income can be calculated as follows ; The monthly income of the deceased is fixed as Rs.5,000 /-; 13 The income of the deceased is Rs.5,000/- and the multiplier is 7 and as such 5000 x 12 x 7= 4,20,000/- Personal expenses is to be deducted as 1/4th which comes to Rs.4,20,000/- /4 = Rs.1,05,000/- = Rs.3,15,000/- Sl.No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs. 3,15,000/- 2 Medical Expenses (Rounded Off) Rs. 88,000/- 3 Loss of Consortium Rs. 50,000/- 4 Loss of Love and Affection Rs. 50,000/- 5 Funeral Expenses Rs. 20,000/- 6 Damages to clothing Rs. 2,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs. 5,25,000/- 28. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.3,25,000/- of claim amount and the other petitioners are each entitled for a sum of Rs.50,000/- of claim amount. In the result , the 2nd Respondent is liable to pay a sum of Rs.5,25,000/- with interest to the petitioners, at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with cost within three months. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.3,25,000/- with interest, 14 and the petitioners 2 to 5 are each entitled for a sum of Rs.50,000/- with interest. After deposit, the petitioners 1 to 5 are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount immediately. The court fee of Rs.4622.50- is ordered to be paid by the petitioners within 15 days. The Advocate fees is fixed at Rs.12,250/- to be paid by the 2nd respondent by a separate cheque.

Therefore it is to be seen whether the vehicle driven by the 1st Respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and hit the vehicle of the deceased and caused the accident. 10.In support of their claim the Petitioners have examined one Jayaraj who is the eye witness of the accident occurred on 06.08.2015. In his chief examination he would depose that on 06.08.2015 at about 08.55 P.M. when he was standing in a Bakery at Mettupalayam Road and was having Tea he saw the offending vehicle bearing Regn NO. TN 33 AT 9235 BOLERO GEEP hit the TVS 50 in which the deceased was riding. Immediately he rushed to the spot and informed 7 PW-1 the son of the deceased. Thereafter, he was shifted to Ganga Medical Centre for treatment. 11.Though in the chief examination he would depose that he saw the offending vehicle driven by the 1st Respondent hit the vehicle of the deceased however, during cross examination he would depose that he did not notice the offending vehicle from where it was proceeding and after hearing the sound only he saw the accident and went to the spot. 12.Though the 1st Respondent would contend that the deceased lost control over the vehicle and fell down and on seeing him fell down he stopped his vehicle and not hit him; on perusal of Ex.P6 MVI Report in respect of the offending vehicle it is evident that the offending vehicle was damaged in the front right side of the vehicle at the time of inspection. Though the 1st Respondnet would contend that without license and without head lamp in the vehicle the deceased had driven his vehicle absolutely no matierisl to show that because of that the deceased has also contributed to the accident. 13.Further on perusal of Ex.P5 report submitted by the Motor Vehicles Inspector, it is evident that the Motor cycle bearing Regn NO. TN 38 K 7951 driven by the deceased was owned by one S.Ravikumar, S/o.Swaminathan. Further at the time of inspection the driving license of the deceased was not produced. Similarly no insurance policy was not produced to the Motor Vehicle Inspector. It is also to be noted that in Ex.P5 MV Inspector has categorically stated in respect of efficiency of foot brake that the vehicle in which the deceased was riding was not in a running condition however, he has opined that the accident was not due to any mechanical defects found at the time of inspection. Further the MV inspector has not stated anything about the non 8 functioning of the head lamp in the vehicle. 14.Admittedly, the 1st respondent is the driver of the offending vehicle and there is no dispute in this regard. Similarly there is no dispute regarding the accident occurred on 06.08.2015 and the offending vehicle was involved in the accident. Further Charge sheet is laid against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s.279, 304 (A) of IPC; in addition to that there is no contra evidence available on the part of the 1st Respondent that the deceased also contributed to the accident. And hence this court holds that the 1st respondent alone has hit the vehicle of the deceased and caused the accident. Thus the Point No.1 is answered as against the 1st Respondent. POINT NO.2:- Who is liable to pay compensation? 15.Admittedly the offending vehicle was driven by the 1st Respondent and the 2n Respondent is the owner of that vehicle. Similarly there is no dispute regarding the accident occurred on 06.08.2015 and the offending vehicle was involved in the accident. Likewise there is also no dispute that the 1st Respondent is the employee of the 2nd Respondent. Hence as owner of the offending vehicle vicariously the 2nd Respondent is liable to pay compensation to the Petitioners. POINT NO.3:- Whether the Petitioners are entitled for compensation? 16.The contention of the Petitioners is that the 1st Petitioner is the wife of the deceased and the other Petitioners are the sons and daughter of the deceased 9 Marimuthu. In order to prove the same the Petitioners have marked the death certificate and the legal heir certificate as Ex.P8 and Ex.P9 and there is no contra evidence available on this regard. Therefore this court has no hesitation to hold that the Petitioners are entitled for compensation. POINT NO.4:- If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the Petitioners ? 17.The contention of the Petitioner is the at the time of accident the Deceased was aged about 64 years and was hale and healthy and at the time of accident he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/-pm from his business. All the Petitioners were depending upon the income of the deceased alone. The deceased alone was the only bread winner of the family and he was taking care of the entire family. Due to his sudden demise the Petitioners find it difficult to maintain the family and the day-to-day expenses. The Petitioners are suffering under heavy financial crisis to meet out the expenses. The welfare of the entire family is shattered. The love and affection on the deceased never be compensated in any means. The pain and sufferings and loss of earning cannot be estimated in terms of money. Any award of compensation never fulfill their needs and love and affection. 18.Though the Petitioners have contended that the deceased was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- pm no documentary proof is filed by them in support of their case. On perusal of Ex.P7 Post Mortem report no adverse remarks made against the deceased. 19.This court has carefully gone through the available material on hand. The accident and the death of deceased are not disputed by the 2nd Respondent and 10 the 2nd Respondent remained absent and set ex-parte. Further no adverse remarks found in the post mortem certificate. Further no evidence is available to show that the deceased also contributed to the accident. Therefore, as there is no contra evident available on the part of the 2nd Respondent that the deceased also contributed to the negligence the contention of the 1st Respondent cannot be countenanced with as the contention of the 1st Respondent is vague and usual defence raised. 20.Now with regard to the quantum of compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives are the dependents of the deceased. The compensation should commensurate to the loss of defense suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 21.In a given case, if the claim case so exorbitant if the claim is made out ground layout the tribunal may not accept the claim and may proceed to determine the possible income by resorting to some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the relevant point of time depending on the facts and circumstances of the each case. 22.Now coming to the quantum of compensation to be paid as stated earlier the Petitioners have not adduced any evidence both oral as well as documentary evidence considering the age of the deceased at the time of the accident the income of the deceased is to be guesstimated according to the given circumstances of the case. 11 23.The above said view of this court is well supported by the decision of the Apex Court reported in 2014(1) TNMAC 459 (SC) 2014(2) SCC 735 Syed Saliq vs divisional manager, united India insurance company limited. The above judgment would categorically rule that there cannot be positive evidence for a person who is working in an unorganized sector or doing his own business and hence the court has to guesstimate the monthly income going by the present state of economy and the rising prices. 24.In the present case, the age of the deceased is 64 years and the income is fixed as Rs.5,000/-. By applying the Multiplier as per the dictum laid down by the Apex court in Sarala Varma case the Multiplier is 7 which is the proper multiplier for assessing the income of the deceased. As per the law laid down in Sarala Varma case half of the amount is to be deducted for personal expenses. Considering the age of the deceased and in view of the dictum laid down by the apex court 1/4th of the total income is deducted for personal expenses of the deceased. 25.The Honourable Supreme Court had held that the wife is entitled for consortium to the extent of Rs.1,00,000/- Honourable Supreme Court in 2013 ACJ 1403 Rajesh and Others V Rajbir Singh in Para 20 held as follows: “20. We may therefore, revisit the practice of awarding compensation under conventional heads, Loss of Consortium to the spouse, Loss of Love, care and guidance to children and Funeral Expenses. It may be noted that the sum of Rs.2,500/- to Rs.10,000/- in those heads was fixed several decades ago and having regard to inflation factor, the some needs to be increased. In Sarla Varma's case (supra), it was held that Compensation for Loss of Consortium should be in the range of Rs.5,000/- to Rs.10,000/- In legal parlance, 12 'consortium' is the right of the spouse to the Company, care, help, comfort, guidance, society, solace, affection and sexual relations with his or her mate. That non-pecuniary head of damages has not been properly understood by our Courts. The Loss of Companionship, Love, Care and Protection, etc., the spouse is entitled to get, has to be compensated appropriately. The Concept of Non- Pecuniary Damage for Loss of Consortium' is one of the major head of award of Compensation in other parts of the world more particularly in the United States of America, Australia, etc., English Courts have also recognized the right of a spouse to get Compensation even during the period of temporary disablement. By Loss of Consortium, the Courts have made an attempt to compensate the loss of spouse's affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations during the future years. Unlike the Compensation awarded in other countries and other jurisdictions, since the Legal Heirs are otherwise adequately compensated for the Pecuniary Loss,it would not be proper to award a major amount under the head. Hence, we are of the view that it would only be just and reasonable that the Courts award at least rupees one lakh for Loss of Consortium”. and following above judgment, in the present case, considering the age of the deceased, this court holds that the 1st petitioner being the wife is entitled to a sum of Rs.50,000/-. 26.Apart from the above the Petitioners have also marked the medical bills pertaining to the treatment given to the deceased which comes to a sum of Rs.87,945/-. It is rounder off Rs.88,000/- 27.As such the calculation of loss of income can be calculated as follows ; The monthly income of the deceased is fixed as Rs.5,000 /-; 13 The income of the deceased is Rs.5,000/- and the multiplier is 7 and as such 5000 x 12 x 7= 4,20,000/- Personal expenses is to be deducted as 1/4th which comes to Rs.4,20,000/- /4 = Rs.1,05,000/- = Rs.3,15,000/- Sl.No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs. 3,15,000/- 2 Medical Expenses (Rounded Off) Rs. 88,000/- 3 Loss of Consortium Rs. 50,000/- 4 Loss of Love and Affection Rs. 50,000/- 5 Funeral Expenses Rs. 20,000/- 6 Damages to clothing Rs. 2,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs. 5,25,000/- 28. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.3,25,000/- of claim amount and the other petitioners are each entitled for a sum of Rs.50,000/- of claim amount. In the result , the 2nd Respondent is liable to pay a sum of Rs.5,25,000/- with interest to the petitioners, at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with cost within three months. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.3,25,000/- with interest, 14 and the petitioners 2 to 5 are each entitled for a sum of Rs.50,000/- with interest. After deposit, the petitioners 1 to 5 are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount immediately. The court fee of Rs.4622.50- is ordered to be paid by the petitioners within 15 days. The Advocate fees is fixed at Rs.12,250/- to be paid by the 2nd respondent by a separate cheque.

Tmt. Maragatham, 2. Minor. Punitha, Rep by her mother Tmt.Maragatham 3. Minor. Rajeshwari ..... Petitioners ­Vs­ The National Insurance Company Ltd., Coimbatore ..... Respondent This petition taken on file this court on 29.09.2015 and coming up before me for final hearing on 21.01.2020 in the presence of Thiru.V.K.Subramaniam, Advocate for the petitioners and of Thiru.V.Gopalakrishnan, Advocate for the Respondant and after hearing the arguments on both sides and upon perusing the materials available on record, this court passed the following:­ ORDER This petition filed by the petitioners u/s. 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act to pass an award of Rs.15,00,000/­ from the respondent. 2. The short facts of the petition in brief is as follows: On 26.07.2014 the deceased Latha was misssed her college bus and took her Hero Pleasure motor cycle bearing Registration No.TN 37 CF 7836 along with her friends and chased the bus and she dashed against the Iron Board in the left side of the road at Sullimadaikuttai and she sustained multiple injuries and she was taken to Abirami Hospital MCOP.No. 457 / 2015 2 through 108 Ambulance and she died in the hospital. She was studied final year B.Sc. IT at Karpagam Arts College, Coimbatore. The 1st petitioner is the owner of the vehicle and the respondent is the insurer of the vehicle. The 1st petitioners is the mother and the petitioners 2 & 3 are the sisters of deceased Latha and they have filed this application for compensation as against the respondent. Hence the petition. 3. The short facts of the counter filed by the respondent in brief is as follows:­ This petition is not maintainable either in law or on facts. The 1st petitioner is the onwer of vehicle bearing Registration No.TN 37 CF 7836. The deceased Latha is the driver of the vehicle bearing Registration No.TN37 CF 7836 insured with this respondent and as per the policy the driver is not a third party and so the petitioners are not entitled for any compensation. The deceased Latha was not holding a valid and effective driving license at the time of the accident. Further the deceased Latha is not covered by the policy of insurance issued by this respondent. Hence the respondent is not liable to pay compansation as claimed by the petitioners. Hence the respondent prays for dismissal of the petition. 4. Now the points that arises for consideration in this petition are as follows:­ 1. Whether the respondents are responsible for paying compensation to the petitioners? 2. If so, to what amount of compensation, the petitioners are entitled to? 5. On the side of the petitioners, the 1st petitoner Tmt.Maragatham was examined as Pw1 through whom Ex.P1 & Ex.P2 were marked and one third party Thiru.S.Sampath was examined as PW.2 and through whom Ex.P3 was marked. On the side of the respondent, The Deputy Manager, Tmt.Divya was examined as RW.1 and through whom Ex.R1 was marked. 6. Point No. 1 and 2: The 1st petitioner was examined as PW.1 and she is the owner of the vehicle and the deceased is the daughter of the 1st petitioner. MCOP.No. 457 / 2015 3 7.The Learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners has submitted that the vehicle was insured with the respondent and the policy is taken as owner / ridder and so the deceased is treated to be owner / driver and so the petitioners are entitled to get the compensation. 8.The Learned counsel appearing for the respondent has submitted that the deceased is not a third party and the contract is only between the 1st petitioner and the respondent and so the respondent is not liable to give any compensation to the petitioners. Further he has submitted that the deceased is not deemed to be an onwer and so he prays for dismissal of the petition. 9.At this juncture this Court has to decide that whether the 1st peittioner as the owner of the vehicle is entitled to get the compensation as per the policy? 10.It is admitted fact that the deceased is not a third party. 11.The policy reads as follows B. Liability Premium Computation (Section II) In Rs. Basic TP Cover 422.00 CNGL/LPG/Bi­Fuel Kit 0.00 Add Compulsary PA Cover (Owner Driver) 50.00 Optional PA cover (un Named passenger) 0.00 Optional PA cover (Un named driver) 0.00 Legal Liability Cover (paid drivers, cleaners) 0.00 Legal Liability Cover (per licensed passenger) 0.00 Total Liability Premium (B) 472.00 Total Premium (A+B) 1117.00 For any other extra 0.00 Add Service Tax 139.00 Gross Premium 1256.00 MCOP.No. 457 / 2015 4 11.At this juncture, this Court has to decide that the petitioners are entitled to get the compensation from the respondent, since there is no optional premium for PA cover (Unnamed Driver) is not paid 12.The decision reported in SC ­ 2013 (4) LW P. 129 – Supreme Court of India – Ramchandra Vs. United India Insurance Co. Ltd – in Civil Appeal No. 8725/2012 – Wherein it was held as follows At Paragraph No.15 15. In support of his submission, counsel for the insurance company has invited the attention of this Court to the case of National Insurance Company vs. Prembai Patel & Ors., reported in (2005) 6 SCC 172. In this matter, the claim petition had been filed by the respondent/claimant 3 to 6 claiming compensation for the death of one Sunder Singh who was an employee of the insured/owner of the vehicle who died in the accident in course of his employment and a claim petition was filed claiming compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act. The main question which arose for consideration in the said appeal was whether the appellant/insurance company was liable to pay the entire amount of compensation awarded to the claimants or its liability was restricted to that which was prescribed under the Workmens Compensation Act. The learned Judges in this matter observed as under: The insurance policy being in the nature of a contract, it is permissible for an owner to take such a policy wherein the entire liability in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any such employee as is described in sub clauses (a) or (b) or (c) of the proviso 1 to Section 147 (1)(b) of the Motor Vehicles Act may be fastened upon the insurance company and the insurance company may become liable to satisfy the entire award. However, for this purpose, the owner must take a policy of that particular kind for which he may be required to pay additional premium and the policy must clearly show that the liability of the insurance company in case of death of or bodily injury in the aforesaid kind of employee is not restricted to that provided under the Workmens Compensation Act and is either more or unlimited depending MCOP.No. 457 / 2015 5 upon the quantum of premium paid and the terms of the policy. The learned Judges in this ruling held that this interpretation is in consonance with the view expressed by a Constitution Bench in New India Assurance Company Ltd. vs. C.M. Jaya & Ors., reported in (2002) 2 SCC 278 wherein while interpreting the provisions of Section 95 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act 1939, the Court held as under in para 10 of the report :­ The liability could be statutory or contractual. A statutory liability cannot be more than what is required under the statute itself. However, there is nothing in Section 95 of the Act prohibiting the parties from contracting to create unlimited or higher liability to cover wider risk. In such an event, the insurer is bound by the terms of the contract as specified in the policy in regard to unlimited or higher liability as the case may be. In the absence of such a term or clause in the policy, pursuant to the contract of insurance, a limited statutory liability cannot be expanded to make it unlimited or higher. If it is so done, it amounts to rewriting the statute or the contract of insurance which is not permissible. Several other authorities were also relied upon which were rendered in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Shanti Bai & Ors. (1995) 2 SCC 539 and Amrit Lal Sood vs. Kaushalya Devi Thapar & Ors., (1998) 3 SCC 744 wherein it was held that in case of insurance policy not taking any higher liability by accepting a higher premium, the liability of the insurance company is neither unlimited nor higher than the statutory liability fixed under Section 95 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act 1939. It was further laid down that it is open to the insured to make payment of additional higher premium and get higher risk covered in respect of 3rd party also. But in the absence of any such clause in the insurance policy, the liability of the insurer cannot be unlimited in respect of 3rd party and it is limited only to the statutory liability. 16. The learned Judges therefore held that in case the owner of the vehicle wants the liability of the insurance company in respect of death of or bodily injury to any such employee as is described in clauses (a) or (b) or (c) of proviso (i) to Section 147 (1) (b), the same should not be restricted to that under the Workmens Compensation Act but should be more or unlimited, but he must take such a policy by making payment of extra premium and the policy should also contain a clause to that effect. MCOP.No. 457 / 2015 6 However, where the policy mentions a policy for Act Liability or Act Liability, the liability of the insurance company qua the employees as aforesaid would not be unlimited but would be limited to that arising under the Workmens Compensation Act. The learned Judges were, therefore, pleased to hold that the liability of the insurance company to satisfy the award would be restricted to that arising under the Workmens Compensation Act and the owner of the vehicle was held liable to satisfy the remaining portion of the award. 17. A perusal of the aforesaid judgment and order of this Court thus indicate that this Court has clearly held that the liability to pay compensation in respect of death or bodily injury to an employee should not be restricted to that under the Workmens Compensation Act but should be more or unlimited. However, the determination would depend whether a policy has been taken by the vehicle owner by making payment of extra premium and whether the policy also contains a clause to that effect. 13. Considering the legal position and applying the present facts of thecase, the owner of the vehicle has paid the premium for compulsary PA Cover for Owner / Driver only. The owner of the vehicle did not pay the premium for optional PA cover to the unnamed driver. There is no contract betwen the onwer and the insurance company for any rider of the vehicle and the deceased is not the owner of the vehicle and hence the petitioners are not entitled to get any compansation from the respondent. 14. In this case the policy is taken only for the onwer­cum­driver and the deceased is the daughter of the owner of the vehicle and hence the deceased should not be turned as owner of the vehicle and hence petition fails and accordingly the petition is dismissed and thus the points are answered accordingly. In the result the petition is dismissed. No cost.

United India Insurance Co. Ltd – in Civil Appeal No. 8725/2012 – Wherein it was held as follows At Paragraph No.15 15. In support of his submission, counsel for the insurance company has invited the attention of this Court to the case of National Insurance Company vs. Prembai Patel & Ors., reported in (2005) 6 SCC 172. In this matter, the claim petition had been filed by the respondent/claimant 3 to 6 claiming compensation for the death of one Sunder Singh who was an employee of the insured/owner of the vehicle who died in the accident in course of his employment and a claim petition was filed claiming compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act. The main question which arose for consideration in the said appeal was whether the appellant/insurance company was liable to pay the entire amount of compensation awarded to the claimants or its liability was restricted to that which was prescribed under the Workmens Compensation Act. The learned Judges in this matter observed as under: The insurance policy being in the nature of a contract, it is permissible for an owner to take such a policy wherein the entire liability in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any such employee as is described in sub clauses (a) or (b) or (c) of the proviso 1 to Section 147 (1)(b) of the Motor Vehicles Act may be fastened upon the insurance company and the insurance company may become liable to satisfy the entire award. However, for this purpose, the owner must take a policy of that particular kind for which he may be required to pay additional premium and the policy must clearly show that the liability of the insurance company in case of death of or bodily injury in the aforesaid kind of employee is not restricted to that provided under the Workmens Compensation Act and is either more or unlimited depending MCOP.No. 457 / 2015 5 upon the quantum of premium paid and the terms of the policy. The learned Judges in this ruling held that this interpretation is in consonance with the view expressed by a Constitution Bench in New India Assurance Company Ltd. vs. C.M. Jaya & Ors., reported in (2002) 2 SCC 278 wherein while interpreting the provisions of Section 95 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act 1939, the Court held as under in para 10 of the report :­ The liability could be statutory or contractual. A statutory liability cannot be more than what is required under the statute itself. However, there is nothing in Section 95 of the Act prohibiting the parties from contracting to create unlimited or higher liability to cover wider risk. In such an event, the insurer is bound by the terms of the contract as specified in the policy in regard to unlimited or higher liability as the case may be. In the absence of such a term or clause in the policy, pursuant to the contract of insurance, a limited statutory liability cannot be expanded to make it unlimited or higher. If it is so done, it amounts to rewriting the statute or the contract of insurance which is not permissible. Several other authorities were also relied upon which were rendered in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Shanti Bai & Ors. (1995) 2 SCC 539 and Amrit Lal Sood vs. Kaushalya Devi Thapar & Ors., (1998) 3 SCC 744 wherein it was held that in case of insurance policy not taking any higher liability by accepting a higher premium, the liability of the insurance company is neither unlimited nor higher than the statutory liability fixed under Section 95 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act 1939. It was further laid down that it is open to the insured to make payment of additional higher premium and get higher risk covered in respect of 3rd party also. But in the absence of any such clause in the insurance policy, the liability of the insurer cannot be unlimited in respect of 3rd party and it is limited only to the statutory liability. 16. The learned Judges therefore held that in case the owner of the vehicle wants the liability of the insurance company in respect of death of or bodily injury to any such employee as is described in clauses (a) or (b) or (c) of proviso (i) to Section 147 (1) (b), the same should not be restricted to that under the Workmens Compensation Act but should be more or unlimited, but he must take such a policy by making payment of extra premium and the policy should also contain a clause to that effect. MCOP.No. 457 / 2015 6 However, where the policy mentions a policy for Act Liability or Act Liability, the liability of the insurance company qua the employees as aforesaid would not be unlimited but would be limited to that arising under the Workmens Compensation Act. The learned Judges were, therefore, pleased to hold that the liability of the insurance company to satisfy the award would be restricted to that arising under the Workmens Compensation Act and the owner of the vehicle was held liable to satisfy the remaining portion of the award. 17. A perusal of the aforesaid judgment and order of this Court thus indicate that this Court has clearly held that the liability to pay compensation in respect of death or bodily injury to an employee should not be restricted to that under the Workmens Compensation Act but should be more or unlimited. However, the determination would depend whether a policy has been taken by the vehicle owner by making payment of extra premium and whether the policy also contains a clause to that effect. 13. Considering the legal position and applying the present facts of thecase, the owner of the vehicle has paid the premium for compulsary PA Cover for Owner / Driver only. The owner of the vehicle did not pay the premium for optional PA cover to the unnamed driver. There is no contract betwen the onwer and the insurance company for any rider of the vehicle and the deceased is not the owner of the vehicle and hence the petitioners are not entitled to get any compansation from the respondent. 14. In this case the policy is taken only for the onwer­cum­driver and the deceased is the daughter of the owner of the vehicle and hence the deceased should not be turned as owner of the vehicle and hence petition fails and accordingly the petition is dismissed and thus the points are answered accordingly. In the result the petition is dismissed. No cost.

The deceased Latha is the driver of the vehicle bearing Registration No.TN37 CF 7836 insured with this respondent and as per the policy the driver is not a third party and so the petitioners are not entitled for any compensation. The deceased Latha was not holding a valid and effective driving license at the time of the accident. Further the deceased Latha is not covered by the policy of insurance issued by this respondent. Hence the respondent is not liable to pay compansation as claimed by the petitioners. Hence the respondent prays for dismissal of the petition. 4.

The 1st petitioners is the mother and the petitioners 2 & 3 are the sisters of deceased Latha and they have filed this application for compensation as against the respondent. Hence the petition. 3. The short facts of the counter filed by the respondent in brief is as follows:­ This petition is not maintainable either in law or on facts. The 1st petitioner is the onwer of vehicle bearing Registration No.TN 37 CF 7836. The deceased Latha is the driver of the vehicle bearing Registration No.TN37 CF 7836 insured with this respondent and as per the policy the driver is not a third party and so the petitioners are not entitled for any compensation. The deceased Latha was not holding a valid and effective driving license at the time of the accident. Further the deceased Latha is not covered by the policy of insurance issued by this respondent. Hence the respondent is not liable to pay compansation as claimed by the petitioners. Hence the respondent prays for dismissal of the petition. 4. Now the points that arises for consideration in this petition are as follows:­ 1. Whether the respondents are responsible for paying compensation to the petitioners? 2. If so, to what amount of compensation, the petitioners are entitled to? 5. On the side of the petitioners, the 1st petitoner Tmt.Maragatham was examined as Pw1 through whom Ex.P1 & Ex.P2 were marked and one third party Thiru.S.Sampath was examined as PW.2 and through whom Ex.P3 was marked. On the side of the respondent, The Deputy Manager, Tmt.Divya was examined as RW.1 and through whom Ex.R1 was marked. 6. Point No. 1 and 2: The 1st petitioner was examined as PW.1 and she is the owner of the vehicle and the deceased is the daughter of the 1st petitioner. MCOP.No. 457 / 2015 3 7.The Learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners has submitted that the vehicle was insured with the respondent and the policy is taken as owner / ridder and so the deceased is treated to be owner / driver and so the petitioners are entitled to get the compensation. 8.The Learned counsel appearing for the respondent has submitted that the deceased is not a third party and the contract is only between the 1st petitioner and the respondent and so the respondent is not liable to give any compensation to the petitioners. Further he has submitted that the deceased is not deemed to be an onwer and so he prays for dismissal of the petition. 9.At this juncture this Court has to decide that whether the 1st peittioner as the owner of the vehicle is entitled to get the compensation as per the policy? 10.It is admitted fact that the deceased is not a third party. 11.The policy reads as follows B. Liability Premium Computation (Section II) In Rs. Basic TP Cover 422.00 CNGL/LPG/Bi­Fuel Kit 0.00 Add Compulsary PA Cover (Owner Driver) 50.00 Optional PA cover (un Named passenger) 0.00 Optional PA cover (Un named driver) 0.00 Legal Liability Cover (paid drivers, cleaners) 0.00 Legal Liability Cover (per licensed passenger) 0.00 Total Liability Premium (B) 472.00 Total Premium (A+B) 1117.00 For any other extra 0.00 Add Service Tax 139.00 Gross Premium 1256.00 MCOP.No. 457 / 2015 4 11.At this juncture, this Court has to decide that the petitioners are entitled to get the compensation from the respondent, since there is no optional premium for PA cover (Unnamed Driver) is not paid 12.The decision reported in SC ­ 2013 (4) LW P. 129 – Supreme Court of India – Ramchandra Vs. United India Insurance Co. Ltd – in Civil Appeal No. 8725/2012 – Wherein it was held as follows At Paragraph No.15 15. In support of his submission, counsel for the insurance company has invited the attention of this Court to the case of National Insurance Company vs. Prembai Patel & Ors., reported in (2005) 6 SCC 172. In this matter, the claim petition had been filed by the respondent/claimant 3 to 6 claiming compensation for the death of one Sunder Singh who was an employee of the insured/owner of the vehicle who died in the accident in course of his employment and a claim petition was filed claiming compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act. The main question which arose for consideration in the said appeal was whether the appellant/insurance company was liable to pay the entire amount of compensation awarded to the claimants or its liability was restricted to that which was prescribed under the Workmens Compensation Act. The learned Judges in this matter observed as under: The insurance policy being in the nature of a contract, it is permissible for an owner to take such a policy wherein the entire liability in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any such employee as is described in sub clauses (a) or (b) or (c) of the proviso 1 to Section 147 (1)(b) of the Motor Vehicles Act may be fastened upon the insurance company and the insurance company may become liable to satisfy the entire award. However, for this purpose, the owner must take a policy of that particular kind for which he may be required to pay additional premium and the policy must clearly show that the liability of the insurance company in case of death of or bodily injury in the aforesaid kind of employee is not restricted to that provided under the Workmens Compensation Act and is either more or unlimited depending MCOP.No. 457 / 2015 5 upon the quantum of premium paid and the terms of the policy. The learned Judges in this ruling held that this interpretation is in consonance with the view expressed by a Constitution Bench in New India Assurance Company Ltd. vs. C.M. Jaya & Ors., reported in (2002) 2 SCC 278 wherein while interpreting the provisions of Section 95 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act 1939, the Court held as under in para 10 of the report :­ The liability could be statutory or contractual. A statutory liability cannot be more than what is required under the statute itself. However, there is nothing in Section 95 of the Act prohibiting the parties from contracting to create unlimited or higher liability to cover wider risk. In such an event, the insurer is bound by the terms of the contract as specified in the policy in regard to unlimited or higher liability as the case may be. In the absence of such a term or clause in the policy, pursuant to the contract of insurance, a limited statutory liability cannot be expanded to make it unlimited or higher. If it is so done, it amounts to rewriting the statute or the contract of insurance which is not permissible. Several other authorities were also relied upon which were rendered in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Shanti Bai & Ors. (1995) 2 SCC 539 and Amrit Lal Sood vs. Kaushalya Devi Thapar & Ors., (1998) 3 SCC 744 wherein it was held that in case of insurance policy not taking any higher liability by accepting a higher premium, the liability of the insurance company is neither unlimited nor higher than the statutory liability fixed under Section 95 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act 1939. It was further laid down that it is open to the insured to make payment of additional higher premium and get higher risk covered in respect of 3rd party also. But in the absence of any such clause in the insurance policy, the liability of the insurer cannot be unlimited in respect of 3rd party and it is limited only to the statutory liability. 16. The learned Judges therefore held that in case the owner of the vehicle wants the liability of the insurance company in respect of death of or bodily injury to any such employee as is described in clauses (a) or (b) or (c) of proviso (i) to Section 147 (1) (b), the same should not be restricted to that under the Workmens Compensation Act but should be more or unlimited, but he must take such a policy by making payment of extra premium and the policy should also contain a clause to that effect. MCOP.No. 457 / 2015 6 However, where the policy mentions a policy for Act Liability or Act Liability, the liability of the insurance company qua the employees as aforesaid would not be unlimited but would be limited to that arising under the Workmens Compensation Act. The learned Judges were, therefore, pleased to hold that the liability of the insurance company to satisfy the award would be restricted to that arising under the Workmens Compensation Act and the owner of the vehicle was held liable to satisfy the remaining portion of the award. 17. A perusal of the aforesaid judgment and order of this Court thus indicate that this Court has clearly held that the liability to pay compensation in respect of death or bodily injury to an employee should not be restricted to that under the Workmens Compensation Act but should be more or unlimited. However, the determination would depend whether a policy has been taken by the vehicle owner by making payment of extra premium and whether the policy also contains a clause to that effect. 13. Considering the legal position and applying the present facts of thecase, the owner of the vehicle has paid the premium for compulsary PA Cover for Owner / Driver only. The owner of the vehicle did not pay the premium for optional PA cover to the unnamed driver. There is no contract betwen the onwer and the insurance company for any rider of the vehicle and the deceased is not the owner of the vehicle and hence the petitioners are not entitled to get any compansation from the respondent. 14. In this case the policy is taken only for the onwer­cum­driver and the deceased is the daughter of the owner of the vehicle and hence the deceased should not be turned as owner of the vehicle and hence petition fails and accordingly the petition is dismissed and thus the points are answered accordingly. In the result the petition is dismissed. No cost.

If it is so done, it amounts to rewriting the statute or the contract of insurance which is not permissible. Several other authorities were also relied upon which were rendered in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Shanti Bai & Ors. (1995) 2 SCC 539 and Amrit Lal Sood vs. Kaushalya Devi Thapar & Ors., (1998) 3 SCC 744 wherein it was held that in case of insurance policy not taking any higher liability by accepting a higher premium, the liability of the insurance company is neither unlimited nor higher than the statutory liability fixed under Section 95 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act 1939. It was further laid down that it is open to the insured to make payment of additional higher premium and get higher risk covered in respect of 3rd party also. But in the absence of any such clause in the insurance policy, the liability of the insurer cannot be unlimited in respect of 3rd party and it is limited only to the statutory liability. 16. The learned Judges therefore held that in case the owner of the vehicle wants the liability of the insurance company in respect of death of or bodily injury to any such employee as is described in clauses (a) or (b) or (c) of proviso (i) to Section 147 (1) (b), the same should not be restricted to that under the Workmens Compensation Act but should be more or unlimited, but he must take such a policy by making payment of extra premium and the policy should also contain a clause to that effect. MCOP.No. 457 / 2015 6 However, where the policy mentions a policy for Act Liability or Act Liability, the liability of the insurance company qua the employees as aforesaid would not be unlimited but would be limited to that arising under the Workmens Compensation Act. The learned Judges were, therefore, pleased to hold that the liability of the insurance company to satisfy the award would be restricted to that arising under the Workmens Compensation Act and the owner of the vehicle was held liable to satisfy the remaining portion of the award. 17. A perusal of the aforesaid judgment and order of this Court thus indicate that this Court has clearly held that the liability to pay compensation in respect of death or bodily injury to an employee should not be restricted to that under the Workmens Compensation Act but should be more or unlimited. However, the determination would depend whether a policy has been taken by the vehicle owner by making payment of extra premium and whether the policy also contains a clause to that effect. 13. Considering the legal position and applying the present facts of thecase, the owner of the vehicle has paid the premium for compulsary PA Cover for Owner / Driver only. The owner of the vehicle did not pay the premium for optional PA cover to the unnamed driver. There is no contract betwen the onwer and the insurance company for any rider of the vehicle and the deceased is not the owner of the vehicle and hence the petitioners are not entitled to get any compansation from the respondent. 14. In this case the policy is taken only for the onwer­cum­driver and the deceased is the daughter of the owner of the vehicle and hence the deceased should not be turned as owner of the vehicle and hence petition fails and accordingly the petition is dismissed and thus the points are answered accordingly. In the result the petition is dismissed. No cost.

Tmt. Maragatham, 2. Minor. Punitha, Rep by her mother Tmt.Maragatham 3. Minor. Rajeshwari ..... Petitioners ­Vs­ The National Insurance Company Ltd., Coimbatore ..... Respondent This petition taken on file this court on 29.09.2015 and coming up before me for final hearing on 21.01.2020 in the presence of Thiru.V.K.Subramaniam, Advocate for the petitioners and of Thiru.V.Gopalakrishnan, Advocate for the Respondant and after hearing the arguments on both sides and upon perusing the materials available on record, this court passed the following:­ ORDER This petition filed by the petitioners u/s. 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act to pass an award of Rs.15,00,000/­ from the respondent. 2. The short facts of the petition in brief is as follows: On 26.07.2014 the deceased Latha was misssed her college bus and took her Hero Pleasure motor cycle bearing Registration No.TN 37 CF 7836 along with her friends and chased the bus and she dashed against the Iron Board in the left side of the road at Sullimadaikuttai and she sustained multiple injuries and she was taken to Abirami Hospital MCOP.No. 457 / 2015 2 through 108 Ambulance and she died in the hospital. She was studied final year B.Sc. IT at Karpagam Arts College, Coimbatore. The 1st petitioner is the owner of the vehicle and the respondent is the insurer of the vehicle. The 1st petitioners is the mother and the petitioners 2 & 3 are the sisters of deceased Latha and they have filed this application for compensation as against the respondent. Hence the petition. 3. The short facts of the counter filed by the respondent in brief is as follows:­ This petition is not maintainable either in law or on facts. The 1st petitioner is the onwer of vehicle bearing Registration No.TN 37 CF 7836. The deceased Latha is the driver of the vehicle bearing Registration No.TN37 CF 7836 insured with this respondent and as per the policy the driver is not a third party and so the petitioners are not entitled for any compensation. The deceased Latha was not holding a valid and effective driving license at the time of the accident. Further the deceased Latha is not covered by the policy of insurance issued by this respondent. Hence the respondent is not liable to pay compansation as claimed by the petitioners. Hence the respondent prays for dismissal of the petition. 4. Now the points that arises for consideration in this petition are as follows:­ 1. Whether the respondents are responsible for paying compensation to the petitioners? 2. If so, to what amount of compensation, the petitioners are entitled to? 5. On the side of the petitioners, the 1st petitoner Tmt.Maragatham was examined as Pw1 through whom Ex.P1 & Ex.P2 were marked and one third party Thiru.S.Sampath was examined as PW.2 and through whom Ex.P3 was marked. On the side of the respondent, The Deputy Manager, Tmt.Divya was examined as RW.1 and through whom Ex.R1 was marked. 6. Point No. 1 and 2: The 1st petitioner was examined as PW.1 and she is the owner of the vehicle and the deceased is the daughter of the 1st petitioner. MCOP.No. 457 / 2015 3 7.The Learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners has submitted that the vehicle was insured with the respondent and the policy is taken as owner / ridder and so the deceased is treated to be owner / driver and so the petitioners are entitled to get the compensation. 8.The Learned counsel appearing for the respondent has submitted that the deceased is not a third party and the contract is only between the 1st petitioner and the respondent and so the respondent is not liable to give any compensation to the petitioners. Further he has submitted that the deceased is not deemed to be an onwer and so he prays for dismissal of the petition. 9.At this juncture this Court has to decide that whether the 1st peittioner as the owner of the vehicle is entitled to get the compensation as per the policy? 10.It is admitted fact that the deceased is not a third party. 11.The policy reads as follows B. Liability Premium Computation (Section II) In Rs. Basic TP Cover 422.00 CNGL/LPG/Bi­Fuel Kit 0.00 Add Compulsary PA Cover (Owner Driver) 50.00 Optional PA cover (un Named passenger) 0.00 Optional PA cover (Un named driver) 0.00 Legal Liability Cover (paid drivers, cleaners) 0.00 Legal Liability Cover (per licensed passenger) 0.00 Total Liability Premium (B) 472.00 Total Premium (A+B) 1117.00 For any other extra 0.00 Add Service Tax 139.00 Gross Premium 1256.00 MCOP.No. 457 / 2015 4 11.At this juncture, this Court has to decide that the petitioners are entitled to get the compensation from the respondent, since there is no optional premium for PA cover (Unnamed Driver) is not paid 12.The decision reported in SC ­ 2013 (4) LW P. 129 – Supreme Court of India – Ramchandra Vs. United India Insurance Co. Ltd – in Civil Appeal No. 8725/2012 – Wherein it was held as follows At Paragraph No.15 15. In support of his submission, counsel for the insurance company has invited the attention of this Court to the case of National Insurance Company vs. Prembai Patel & Ors., reported in (2005) 6 SCC 172. In this matter, the claim petition had been filed by the respondent/claimant 3 to 6 claiming compensation for the death of one Sunder Singh who was an employee of the insured/owner of the vehicle who died in the accident in course of his employment and a claim petition was filed claiming compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act. The main question which arose for consideration in the said appeal was whether the appellant/insurance company was liable to pay the entire amount of compensation awarded to the claimants or its liability was restricted to that which was prescribed under the Workmens Compensation Act. The learned Judges in this matter observed as under: The insurance policy being in the nature of a contract, it is permissible for an owner to take such a policy wherein the entire liability in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any such employee as is described in sub clauses (a) or (b) or (c) of the proviso 1 to Section 147 (1)(b) of the Motor Vehicles Act may be fastened upon the insurance company and the insurance company may become liable to satisfy the entire award. However, for this purpose, the owner must take a policy of that particular kind for which he may be required to pay additional premium and the policy must clearly show that the liability of the insurance company in case of death of or bodily injury in the aforesaid kind of employee is not restricted to that provided under the Workmens Compensation Act and is either more or unlimited depending MCOP.No. 457 / 2015 5 upon the quantum of premium paid and the terms of the policy. The learned Judges in this ruling held that this interpretation is in consonance with the view expressed by a Constitution Bench in New India Assurance Company Ltd. vs. C.M. Jaya & Ors., reported in (2002) 2 SCC 278 wherein while interpreting the provisions of Section 95 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act 1939, the Court held as under in para 10 of the report :­ The liability could be statutory or contractual. A statutory liability cannot be more than what is required under the statute itself. However, there is nothing in Section 95 of the Act prohibiting the parties from contracting to create unlimited or higher liability to cover wider risk. In such an event, the insurer is bound by the terms of the contract as specified in the policy in regard to unlimited or higher liability as the case may be. In the absence of such a term or clause in the policy, pursuant to the contract of insurance, a limited statutory liability cannot be expanded to make it unlimited or higher. If it is so done, it amounts to rewriting the statute or the contract of insurance which is not permissible. Several other authorities were also relied upon which were rendered in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Shanti Bai & Ors. (1995) 2 SCC 539 and Amrit Lal Sood vs. Kaushalya Devi Thapar & Ors., (1998) 3 SCC 744 wherein it was held that in case of insurance policy not taking any higher liability by accepting a higher premium, the liability of the insurance company is neither unlimited nor higher than the statutory liability fixed under Section 95 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act 1939. It was further laid down that it is open to the insured to make payment of additional higher premium and get higher risk covered in respect of 3rd party also. But in the absence of any such clause in the insurance policy, the liability of the insurer cannot be unlimited in respect of 3rd party and it is limited only to the statutory liability. 16. The learned Judges therefore held that in case the owner of the vehicle wants the liability of the insurance company in respect of death of or bodily injury to any such employee as is described in clauses (a) or (b) or (c) of proviso (i) to Section 147 (1) (b), the same should not be restricted to that under the Workmens Compensation Act but should be more or unlimited, but he must take such a policy by making payment of extra premium and the policy should also contain a clause to that effect. MCOP.No. 457 / 2015 6 However, where the policy mentions a policy for Act Liability or Act Liability, the liability of the insurance company qua the employees as aforesaid would not be unlimited but would be limited to that arising under the Workmens Compensation Act. The learned Judges were, therefore, pleased to hold that the liability of the insurance company to satisfy the award would be restricted to that arising under the Workmens Compensation Act and the owner of the vehicle was held liable to satisfy the remaining portion of the award. 17. A perusal of the aforesaid judgment and order of this Court thus indicate that this Court has clearly held that the liability to pay compensation in respect of death or bodily injury to an employee should not be restricted to that under the Workmens Compensation Act but should be more or unlimited. However, the determination would depend whether a policy has been taken by the vehicle owner by making payment of extra premium and whether the policy also contains a clause to that effect. 13.

In this case the policy is taken only for the onwer­cum­driver and the deceased is the daughter of the owner of the vehicle and hence the deceased should not be turned as owner of the vehicle and hence petition fails and accordingly the petition is dismissed and thus the points are answered accordingly.

The deceased was the root cause of the alleged accident and he drove the vehicle No: TN 38-Y-3530 and dashed against the 1st respondent vehicle. The alleged accident took place in the middle of the road by the rash and negligence of the deceased. The cause and mode of the alleged accident are denied and the petitioners are put to strict proof of the same with documentary evidence.

POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle Hero Honda Pleasure bearing its Registration No. TN 38 BS 7938 on 30-08-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 4. If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 5.On behalf of the petitioner, the petitioner was examined as PW-1, and one Dinesh Kumar was examined as PW-2, and one Karthikeyan was examined as PW-3, and 17 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P17. On behalf of the defendants no witness has been examined and no documents were marked. On behalf of the witness 3 documents were marked as Ex.X1 to Ex.X3. 7 POINT No.1: Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle Hero Honda Pleasure bearing its Registration No. TN 38 BS 7938 on 30-08-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 6.The case of the petitioner is that on 30-08-2015 the deceased Selvaraj was riding in his two wheeler bearing registration No. TN 38 Y 3530 in the Coimbatore to Sakthi Main road. Further case of the petitioner is that on that day the deceased was proceeding to his company JEM Pattern Works and on the way when he turned to his right after proper indication and sound however all of a sudden the two wheeler bearing registration NO. TN 38 BS 7938 dashed against the deceased vehicle who came in a rash and negligent manner. Due to the said accident the deceased was thrown away on the road and sustained multiple injuries all over his body. Further case of the petitioners is that the 1st respondent is the driver cum owner of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the insurer of the offending vehicle. Hence as the accident had occurred due to the rash and negligent act of the 1st respondent both the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 7.Whereas the contention of the 2nd respondent is that the rider of the offending vehicle was not holding in a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the alleged accident. Hence there is a violation of the conditions of policy. Further they would contend that as the conditions in the policy is violated the insurance company is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 8.Further contentions of the 2nd respondent is that they denied the place, date, time and mode of the alleged accident. Further it is also equally false to allege that it is the first respondent who has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. As a matter of fact it is the deceased who was the root cause of the alleged accident since the accident took place in the middle of the road. 9.This Court as given its anxious consideration on the rival contentions of both the parties. On perusal of Ex.P1 F.I.R it reveals that a case is registered as against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s 279 and 304 (A) I.P.C. On perusal of Ex.P2 rough sketch the place of accident is shown. Further on perusal of Ex.P3 M.V . Report in respect of vehicle driven by the 1st respondent it reveals that the 1st respondent was in possession of a valid driving license and the said vehicle is insured under R2. Hence the contention of the 2nd respondent is that the driver of the offending 8 vehicle drove his vehicle without a valid driving licence false to the ground. Further on perusal of Ex.P4 it reveals that the concerned Police has laid his final report as against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s 279 and 304 (A) I.P.C. Further on perusal of Ex.P5 Post mortem certificate the Doctor has opined that the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries and no adverse remarks is mentioned against the deceased. Further the petitioners have also examined PW2 Dinesh Kumar who is the eye witness to the accident. In the chief examination he has categorically deposed that the 1st respondent has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the vehicle of the deceased. Though the PW-2 was elaborately cross examined nothing was able to extract in support of their contention. 10.Therefore taking into consideration of the available materials in hand this court is of the considered view that the petitioner have prima facie established that the 1st respondent alone has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident due to which the deceased died. Hence Point NO 1 is answered against the 1st respondent. POINT NO. 2: Who is liable to pay compensation? 11.Admittedly the 1st respondent is the driver -cum owner of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the insurer and as Point NO. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 12.The case of the petitioner is that the 1st petitioner is the wife of the deceased 2nd and 3rd petitioners are the daughters of the deceased and the 4th and 5th petitioners are the parents of the deceased Selvaraj. 13.Further case of the petitioners is that at the time of accident deceased Selvaraj was aged about 48 years, and he was hale ad healthy at the time of accident and he was working 9 in the Jem Patter works as a turner and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- per month and he also used to get a sum of Rs.5,000/- as extra wages by doing over time. Further case of the petitioners is that the deceased Selvaraj is the only bread winner of the family, and but for the accident he would have lived a long life. 14. Whereas the contention of the 2nd respondent is that it is false to allege that he was getting a sum of Rs.20,000/- p.m and the petitioners are depending upon the income of the deceased Selvaraj, The 2nd respondent would further contend that the claim amount is exorbitant and not sustainable in the eye of law. 15.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or the dependents of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 16.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may proceed to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 17.In order to prove that the deceased was employed and was considerably earning they examined P.W3 Karthiheyan who would depose that the deceased Selvaraj was working in his concern from 2013 onwards and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- of monthly remuneration. However during cross examination he has admitted that though he is running Sree Jem Pattern Works, no attendance register is maintained and his establishment is not registered under E.S.I. and P.F. Act. Further she has also admitted that no monthly salary is paid as such and depending upon 10 the duty the daily cooly is paid to the deceased and in respect of the same no document is maintained by him. On perusal of Ex.X2 it reveals that Srie Jem Works is registered under the Commercial Tax Department and Ex.X3 alleged salary certificate said to have issued by PW3 it is mentioned that the deceased was drawing a consolidated salary of Rs.15,000/- p.m. Further on perusal of Ex.P6 death certificate, It is admitted fact that deceased is died of road accident and Ex.P7 it reveals that the petitioners are the legal heirs of deceased Selvaraj, 18.On analyzing the materials in hand though P.W.3 would deposed that the deceased was employed at his establishment no material evidence is produced before this Court to prove the same. Though Ex.X2, X3 are marked the evidence of PW3 does not inspire the confidence of this Court. Hence considering the age of the deceased as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court Notional income of the deceased is taken into consideration to calculate the compensation. 19.As per the case of the petitioners the age of the deceased is 48 whereas in the post mortem certificate and in the death certificate the age of the deceased is mentioned as 51 Though the petitioners would alleged that deceased Selvaraj is aged about 48 no document evidence is produced to show that at the time of accident the deceased was aged about 48. Therefore the age of the deceased is fixed as 51 and a notional income of a sum of Rs.8,000/- is taken into consideration as monthly wages. And as per the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court a Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 11 and as there are 5 dependents 1/4th of the income of the deceased is deducted for his personal expenditure. 20.As per the latest Judgment Reported in 2017 (2) TN MAC 609 (SC) in the case between National Insurance Company Limited … Vs..... Pranay Sethi and others 10% of the income is taken as addition. Hence 10% of the income comes to Rs.800/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.8,000+ Rs.800/- which is comes to Rs.8,800/-. Hence s sum of Rs.8,800 /- is fixed as income of the deceased. 21.And as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 11 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court considering the marital status of the deceased 1/4 of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 11 22.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as the income of the deceased is Rs.8,800/-. Hence Rs.8,800 X 12 X 11 = Rs.11,61,600/- and 1/4th personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.2,90,400/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs. 11,61,600 – Rs.2,90,400 = Rs.8,71,200/- 23. Further as per the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for funeral expenses, and a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for loss of estate, and a sum of Rs.40,000/- was taken for loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner. 24.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.8,71,200/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/- 3 Funeral Expanes Rs. 15,000/- 4 Loss of consortium Rs. 40,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.9,41,200/- From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.19,41,200/- -towards compensation and the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.9,41,200/ -with interest . 25. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.6,41,200/-of claim amount, and the 2nd to 5th petitioners are entitled for each a sum of Rs.75,000/- of claim amount, Hence point Nos.3 & 4 are answered accordingly. In the result , the Respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.9,41,200/ - with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. And out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.6,41,200/- of claim amount and the 2nd to 5th Petitioners are entitled for each a sum of Rs.75,000/- of claim amount After deposit, all the petitioners are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount with 12 interest immediately. The court fee of Rs.8784.50/- is ordered to be paid by the Petitioners within one month. The Advocate fees is fixed at Rs.16,412/- to be paid by the respondents by a separate cheque.

6q00l125adut4gnbj492c7qa90 (50).pdf,"1 IN THE COURT OF MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL/ IV ADDITIONAL DISTRICT COURT, COIMBATORE PRESENT : Thiru K.Poorana Jeya Anand, M.A., M.L., MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL/ IV ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, COIMBATORE Friday, 31st day of January 2020 M.C.O.P. 457 / 2015 1. Tmt. Maragatham, 2. Minor. Punitha, Rep by her mother Tmt.Maragatham 3. Minor. Rajeshwari ..... Petitioners ­Vs­ The National Insurance Company Ltd., Coimbatore ..... Respondent This petition taken on file this court on 29.09.2015 and coming up before me for final hearing on 21.01.2020 in the presence of Thiru.V.K.Subramaniam, Advocate for the petitioners and of Thiru.V.Gopalakrishnan, Advocate for the Respondant and after hearing the arguments on both sides and upon perusing the materials available on record, this court passed the following:­ ORDER This petition filed by the petitioners u/s. 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act to pass an award of Rs.15,00,000/­ from the respondent. 2. The short facts of the petition in brief is as follows: On 26.07.2014 the deceased Latha was misssed her college bus and took her Hero Pleasure motor cycle bearing Registration No.TN 37 CF 7836 along with her friends and chased the bus and she dashed against the Iron Board in the left side of the road at Sullimadaikuttai and she sustained multiple injuries and she was taken to Abirami Hospital MCOP.No. 457 / 2015 2 through 108 Ambulance and she died in the hospital. She was studied final year B.Sc. IT at Karpagam Arts College, Coimbatore. The 1st petitioner is the owner of the vehicle and the respondent is the insurer of the vehicle. The 1st petitioners is the mother and the petitioners 2 & 3 are the sisters of deceased Latha and they have filed this application for compensation as against the respondent. Hence the petition. 3. The short facts of the counter filed by the respondent in brief is as follows:­ This petition is not maintainable either in law or on facts. The 1st petitioner is the onwer of vehicle bearing Registration No.TN 37 CF 7836. The deceased Latha is the driver of the vehicle bearing Registration No.TN37 CF 7836 insured with this respondent and as per the policy the driver is not a third party and so the petitioners are not entitled for any compensation. The deceased Latha was not holding a valid and effective driving license at the time of the accident. Further the deceased Latha is not covered by the policy of insurance issued by this respondent. Hence the respondent is not liable to pay compansation as claimed by the petitioners. Hence the respondent prays for dismissal of the petition. 4. Now the points that arises for consideration in this petition are as follows:­ 1. Whether the respondents are responsible for paying compensation to the petitioners? 2. If so, to what amount of compensation, the petitioners are entitled to? 5. On the side of the petitioners, the 1st petitoner Tmt.Maragatham was examined as Pw1 through whom Ex.P1 & Ex.P2 were marked and one third party Thiru.S.Sampath was examined as PW.2 and through whom Ex.P3 was marked. On the side of the respondent, The Deputy Manager, Tmt.Divya was examined as RW.1 and through whom Ex.R1 was marked. 6. Point No. 1 and 2: The 1st petitioner was examined as PW.1 and she is the owner of the vehicle and the deceased is the daughter of the 1st petitioner. MCOP.No. 457 / 2015 3 7.The Learned Counsel appearing for the petitioners has submitted that the vehicle was insured with the respondent and the policy is taken as owner / ridder and so the deceased is treated to be owner / driver and so the petitioners are entitled to get the compensation. 8.The Learned counsel appearing for the respondent has submitted that the deceased is not a third party and the contract is only between the 1st petitioner and the respondent and so the respondent is not liable to give any compensation to the petitioners. Further he has submitted that the deceased is not deemed to be an onwer and so he prays for dismissal of the petition. 9.At this juncture this Court has to decide that whether the 1st peittioner as the owner of the vehicle is entitled to get the compensation as per the policy? 10.It is admitted fact that the deceased is not a third party. 11.The policy reads as follows B. Liability Premium Computation (Section II) In Rs. Basic TP Cover 422.00 CNGL/LPG/Bi­Fuel Kit 0.00 Add Compulsary PA Cover (Owner Driver) 50.00 Optional PA cover (un Named passenger) 0.00 Optional PA cover (Un named driver) 0.00 Legal Liability Cover (paid drivers, cleaners) 0.00 Legal Liability Cover (per licensed passenger) 0.00 Total Liability Premium (B) 472.00 Total Premium (A+B) 1117.00 For any other extra 0.00 Add Service Tax 139.00 Gross Premium 1256.00 MCOP.No. 457 / 2015 4 11.At this juncture, this Court has to decide that the petitioners are entitled to get the compensation from the respondent, since there is no optional premium for PA cover (Unnamed Driver) is not paid 12.The decision reported in SC ­ 2013 (4) LW P. 129 – Supreme Court of India – Ramchandra Vs. United India Insurance Co. Ltd – in Civil Appeal No. 8725/2012 – Wherein it was held as follows At Paragraph No.15 15. In support of his submission, counsel for the insurance company has invited the attention of this Court to the case of National Insurance Company vs. Prembai Patel & Ors., reported in (2005) 6 SCC 172. In this matter, the claim petition had been filed by the respondent/claimant 3 to 6 claiming compensation for the death of one Sunder Singh who was an employee of the insured/owner of the vehicle who died in the accident in course of his employment and a claim petition was filed claiming compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act. The main question which arose for consideration in the said appeal was whether the appellant/insurance company was liable to pay the entire amount of compensation awarded to the claimants or its liability was restricted to that which was prescribed under the Workmens Compensation Act. The learned Judges in this matter observed as under: The insurance policy being in the nature of a contract, it is permissible for an owner to take such a policy wherein the entire liability in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any such employee as is described in sub clauses (a) or (b) or (c) of the proviso 1 to Section 147 (1)(b) of the Motor Vehicles Act may be fastened upon the insurance company and the insurance company may become liable to satisfy the entire award. However, for this purpose, the owner must take a policy of that particular kind for which he may be required to pay additional premium and the policy must clearly show that the liability of the insurance company in case of death of or bodily injury in the aforesaid kind of employee is not restricted to that provided under the Workmens Compensation Act and is either more or unlimited depending MCOP.No. 457 / 2015 5 upon the quantum of premium paid and the terms of the policy. The learned Judges in this ruling held that this interpretation is in consonance with the view expressed by a Constitution Bench in New India Assurance Company Ltd. vs. C.M. Jaya & Ors., reported in (2002) 2 SCC 278 wherein while interpreting the provisions of Section 95 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act 1939, the Court held as under in para 10 of the report :­ The liability could be statutory or contractual. A statutory liability cannot be more than what is required under the statute itself. However, there is nothing in Section 95 of the Act prohibiting the parties from contracting to create unlimited or higher liability to cover wider risk. In such an event, the insurer is bound by the terms of the contract as specified in the policy in regard to unlimited or higher liability as the case may be. In the absence of such a term or clause in the policy, pursuant to the contract of insurance, a limited statutory liability cannot be expanded to make it unlimited or higher. If it is so done, it amounts to rewriting the statute or the contract of insurance which is not permissible. Several other authorities were also relied upon which were rendered in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs. Shanti Bai & Ors. (1995) 2 SCC 539 and Amrit Lal Sood vs. Kaushalya Devi Thapar & Ors., (1998) 3 SCC 744 wherein it was held that in case of insurance policy not taking any higher liability by accepting a higher premium, the liability of the insurance company is neither unlimited nor higher than the statutory liability fixed under Section 95 (2) of the Motor Vehicles Act 1939. It was further laid down that it is open to the insured to make payment of additional higher premium and get higher risk covered in respect of 3rd party also. But in the absence of any such clause in the insurance policy, the liability of the insurer cannot be unlimited in respect of 3rd party and it is limited only to the statutory liability. 16. The learned Judges therefore held that in case the owner of the vehicle wants the liability of the insurance company in respect of death of or bodily injury to any such employee as is described in clauses (a) or (b) or (c) of proviso (i) to Section 147 (1) (b), the same should not be restricted to that under the Workmens Compensation Act but should be more or unlimited, but he must take such a policy by making payment of extra premium and the policy should also contain a clause to that effect. MCOP.No. 457 / 2015 6 However, where the policy mentions a policy for Act Liability or Act Liability, the liability of the insurance company qua the employees as aforesaid would not be unlimited but would be limited to that arising under the Workmens Compensation Act. The learned Judges were, therefore, pleased to hold that the liability of the insurance company to satisfy the award would be restricted to that arising under the Workmens Compensation Act and the owner of the vehicle was held liable to satisfy the remaining portion of the award. 17. A perusal of the aforesaid judgment and order of this Court thus indicate that this Court has clearly held that the liability to pay compensation in respect of death or bodily injury to an employee should not be restricted to that under the Workmens Compensation Act but should be more or unlimited. However, the determination would depend whether a policy has been taken by the vehicle owner by making payment of extra premium and whether the policy also contains a clause to that effect. 13. Considering the legal position and applying the present facts of thecase, the owner of the vehicle has paid the premium for compulsary PA Cover for Owner / Driver only. The owner of the vehicle did not pay the premium for optional PA cover to the unnamed driver. There is no contract betwen the onwer and the insurance company for any rider of the vehicle and the deceased is not the owner of the vehicle and hence the petitioners are not entitled to get any compansation from the respondent. 14. In this case the policy is taken only for the onwer­cum­driver and the deceased is the daughter of the owner of the vehicle and hence the deceased should not be turned as owner of the vehicle and hence petition fails and accordingly the petition is dismissed and thus the points are answered accordingly. In the result the petition is dismissed. No cost.

A VERMENTS CONTAINED IN THE PETITION:- i.The petitioners are the legal heirs of the deceased Kaleeswaran who died in a motor vehicle accident that took place on 24.05.2015 involving Santro Car bearing registration No.TN 07 AD 4333. The details of the occurrence of the accident is as follows: ii.On the unfortunate day of 24.05.2015 the said Kaleeswaran was riding a TVS XL motor cycle bearing its registration No.TN 38 BA 6063 on the Coimbatore Mettupalayam road from west to east direction. It was 09.15 p.m. On 24.05.2015 the said Kaleeswaran was nearing Surya Bakery, Rakkipalayam pirivu on the above said road. At the time all at a sudden there came a Santro Car from north to south direction in a rash and negligent manner and dashed the said Kaleeswaran's motor cycle. Due to which the said Kaleeswaran fell down and sustained grievous injuries. The Santro Car bears registration No. TN 07 AD 4333. iii.Immediately after the accident the injured Kaleeswaran was taken to Lakshmi Hospital, Thudiyalur, Coimbatore. There he was taken first and treatment and shifted to Sri Ramakrishna Hospital, Coimbatore ad admitted as in patient. There he was given full treatment and even after best treatment he was succumbed to his injuries on 27.05.2015. The same was informed to the concerned authorities. The Post mortem was conducted and the body was handed over to the petitioners to perform last rites. iv.But for the rash and negligent driving of the Santro Car bearing Registration No. TN 07 AD 4333 by its driver, the accident would not have taken place. The Thudiyalur police have registered a case in Crime No.244/2015 under section 279, 337 IPC and @ 279, 304(A) IPC and arrested the driver of the Santro Car for causing the accident and are investigating upon. v.Before the accident the deceased was working as a Security at Roots Horn 3 company, Rakkiapalayam, Coimbatore and was earning not less than Rs.10,000/- per month including overtime payment. The deceased was the only bread winner and he was maintaining his entire family consisting of his wife and two daughters. The first petitioner is the widow aged about 41 years lost her bread winner as well as lovable husband and mentor. She also lost consortium since she is aged, only 41 years. The 2nd and 3rd petitioners lost their lovable father and mentor and they had to struggle without any guidance and their future is at stake. The 3rd petitioner is minor and her date of birth is 20.03.2000. But for the accident, the deceased would have lived for another 40 years. The petitioners are terribly shocked and their day to day life structure itself is paralyzed. In long and short the untimely death of the deceased has taken the entire wind out of their sail and is going to be an impediment to them. The loss cannot be compensated by any monetary measures. The petitioners are yet to relieve from the shock. vi.The 1st respondent is the driver of the Santro Car bearing Registration No.TN 07 AD 4333 at the date and time of the accident. The 2nd respondent is the registered owner of the said car. The 1st respondent was working under the 2nd respondent at the time and date of accident. The 3rd respondent is the indemnifier under whom the said car has been insured at the time of accident. Therefore all these respondents are jointly, severally and vicariously liable to pay compensation. vii.The suffering and sorrows and mental agonies and hardships that are undergone by the petitioner cannot be compensated by any means of kinds, of course they are incapable of more monetary measures of calculations. However they should be compensated to the extent to which they are practically possible in this material world. 3. A VERMENTS CONTAINED IN THE COUNTER STATEMENT FILED BY THE RESPONDENTS 1 & 2 :- i.The petitioner has sustained grievous injuries in the motor vehicle accident 4 took place on 24.05.2012 at about 09.15. P.M. at Rakkiplayam Pirivu, due to the Santro Car bearing Registration No.TN 07 AD 4333 came from North to South direction in a rash and negligent manner and dashed the motor cycle of the deceased, as alleged by them in para No.2 of the petition. Therefore no question of granting the relief of compensation as claimed by the petitioner would arise. ii.All the facts and allegations made in the petition are totally incorrect, false and baseless. The Respondents clearly assert that the claim of the petitioners is concocted after though story to get unlawful claim. They purposely suppressed the fact that deceased was not a trained, qualified and authorized motor cycle rider, the deceased did not have valid license to drive the motor cycle on the public road. iii.It is the fact that the Mettuplayam Road is a main road lying North South and a busy road always with heavy traffic. The deceased had driven his vehicle across the busy main road in a rash and negligent manner. While crossing the busy road the deceased had confused himself, lost control over his vehicle. If a qualified and licensed driver could have easily controlled the vehicle and crossed the busy road carefully. The deceased was sole liable for that incident. He met with accident on his own fault and he can not blame other for the same. iv.The several allegations contained in paragraph No.4 of the petition are totally false and incorrect and the respondents emphatically deny them. The averments made in paragraph No.5 of the petition are self served and the petitioner has to prove the contentions stated. There are no merit in this petition, it has been filed malafide in order to get unlawful gain from the respondent with ulterior motive. Hence, the petition is liable to be dismissed with cost. 4. A VERMENTS CONTAINED IN THE COUNTER STATEMENT FILED BY THE 3 rd RESPONDENT :- i.The petitioners are put to strict proof that the accident occurred solely due to 5 rash and negligent riding of Santro Car bearing Registration No.TN 07 AD 4333 by the 1st respondent himself and that he was in possession of valid and effective driving license to drive the car as on the date of alleged accident. ii.The petitioners have filed the claim petition with twisted and distorted version of facts so as to enrich their wardrobe out of the unfortunate motor vehicle accident. The petitioners cannot be permitted to get a windfall or a source of profit out of the unfortunate road accident. iii.The limits and limitation of policy of the 3rd respondent may be read as part and parcel of this counter statement. The allegation of petitioners as set forth in the claim petition that on 24.05.2012 when the deceased Kaleeswaran was riding a two wheeler TVS XL bearing Registration No.TN 38 BA 6063 on the Coimbatore – Mettupalayam Road from west to eastern direction and at about 09.15 p.m. when came near Surya Bakery, Rakkipalayam Pirivu, while at that time there came a Santro Car bearing Registration No.TN 07 AD 4333 from north to southern direction in a rash and negligent manner dashed against Kaleeswaran's two wheeler resulting upon the rider of two wheeler fell down and sustained grievous injuries and during the course of treatment and Ramakrishna hospital, he was succumbed to injuries on 27.05.2015 is self serving averments and ought to be proved by the petitioners both orally and through documentary evidence. iv.The 2nd respondent who is owner/insured of offending Santro Car bearing Registration No.TN 07 AD 4333 and his driver have not co-operated with the 3rd respondent in contesting the claim petition effectively and vehemently pursuant to the terms and conditions of policy and also set exparte due to their absence. Therefore, the 3rd respondent may be permitted to take all the defences that are available to owner/insured of Santro Car bearing Registration No.TN 07 AD 4333 and his driver also u/s.149(2) of MV Act without prejudice to own defenses. 6 v.Without prejudice to the contentions raised, the petitioners are put to strict proof of deceased;s age, employment, income, dependency. It is not true that the petitioner was drawing monthly salary of Rs.10,000/- from security job since no document has been produced by petitioner in this respect. vi,In any case the quantum of compensation claimed by petitioners is huge, imaginary and not in consonance with the settled principles of law. The petition lacks merits and bonafides. The petitioners have not come to the court with clean hands. they have filed the claim petition for unlawful gain out of the unfortunate motor vehicle accident. Hence, this petition is to be dismissed. 5. POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle Santro Car bearing Registration No.TN 07 AD 4333, on 24.05.2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation ? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 4.

POINT No.1 :- Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle Santro Car bearing Registration No.TN 07 AD 4333, on 24.05.2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 7.The case of the petitioners is that they are the legal heirs of the deceased Kaleeswaran who died in a motor vehicle accident that took place on 24.05.2015 7 involving Santro Car bearing registration No.TN 07 AD 4333. The details of the occurrence of the accident is as follows: 8.Further case of the petitioners is that on the unfortunate day of 24.05.2015 the said Kaleeswaran was riding a TVS XL motor cycle bearing its registration No.TN 38 BA 6063 on the Coimbatore Mettupalayam road from west to east direction. It was 09.15 p.m. On 24.05.2015 the said Kaleeswaran was nearing Surya Bakery, Rakkipalayam pirivu on the above said road. At the time all at a sudden there came a Santro Car from north to south direction in a rash and negligent manner and dashed the said Kaleeswaran's motor cycle. Due to which the said Kaleeswaran fell down and sustained grievous injuries. 9.Further case of the petitioners is that immediately after the accident the injured Kaleeswaran was taken to Lakshmi Hospital, Thudiyalur, Coimbatore. There he was taken first and treatment and shifted to Sri Ramakrishna Hospital, Coimbatore ad admitted as in patient. There he was given full treatment and even after best treatment he was succumbed to his injuries on 27.05.2015. The same was informed to the concerned authorities. The Post mortem was conducted and the body was handed over to the petitioners to perform last rites. 10.Further case of the petitioners is that but for the rash and negligent driving of the Santro Car bearing Registration No. TN 07 AD 4333 by its driver, the accident would not have taken place. The Thudiyalur police have registered a case in Cr.No.244/2015 under section 279, 337 IPC and @ 279, 304(A) IPC and arrested the driver of the Santro Car for causing the accident and are investigating upon. 11.Further case of the petitioners is that before the accident the deceased was working as a Security at Roots Horn company, Rakkiapalayam, Coimbatore and was earning not less than Rs.10,000/- per month including overtime payment. The deceased was the only bread winner and he was maintaining his entire family 8 consisting of his wife and two daughters. The first petitioner is the widow aged about 41 years lost her bread winner as well as lovable husband and mentor. She also lost consortium since she is aged, only 41 years. The 2nd and 3rd petitioners lost their lovable father and mentor and they had to struggle without any guidance and their future is at stake. The 3rd petitioner is minor and her date of birth is 20.03.2000. But for the accident, the deceased would have lived for another 40 years. The petitioners are terribly shocked and their day to day life structure itself is paralyzed. In long and short the untimely death of the deceased has taken the entire wind out of their sail and is going to be an impediment to them. The loss cannot be compensated by any monetary measures. The petitioners are yet to relieve from the shock. 12.Further case of the petitioners is that the 1st respondent is the driver of the Santro Car bearing Registration No. TN 07 AD 4333 at the date and time of the accident. The 2nd respondent is the registered owner of the said car. The 1st respondent was working under the 2nd respondent at the time and date of accident. The 3rd respondent is the indemnifier under whom the said car has been insured at the time of accident. Therefore all these respondents are jointly, severally and vicariously liable to pay compensation. 13.Further case of the petitioner is that the 1st respondent is the driver of the vehicle at the time of accident and the 2nd respondent is the owner of the vehicle and the 3rd respondent is the insurer of the vehicle driven by the 1st respondent. 14.Further on perusal of Ex.P1 it is evident that on 25.05.2015 complaint was lodged as against the 1st respondent and F.I.R was registered as against him. Based on the F.I.R. final report vide Ex.P6 was filed by concerned police as against the 1st respondent and Ex.P5 Rough Sketch would show the manner of accident. 15.Further the eye witness also examined by the petitioner who would depose that the Santro Car driven by the 1st respondent as dashed against the vehicle of the 9 deceased. As the driver and the owner of the vehicle failed to appear and contest the case this court is of the considered view that Ex.P1, Ex.P2 prima facie establish that R1 has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and caused his death. Further on perusal of the evidence of PW-2 it strengthens the case of the petitioner it is R1 who has driven the vehicle and dashed against the deceased. Hence, point No.1 is answered accordingly. POINT No.2 :- Who is liable to pay compensation ? 16.As already stated R1 is the driver of the offending vehicle and R2 is the owner of the vehicle and R3 is the insurer. As Point No.1 is answered as against R1, all the three respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. POINT No.3 :- Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 17.The case of the petitioners is that the deceased is a husband of 1st petitioner and father of 2nd and 3rd petitioner. Further on perusal of Ex.P9 it is evident that after the death of the deceased,. The petitioners have obtained legal heirs certificate from the concerned authorities wherein all the three petitioners are shown as legal heirs of deceased Kaleeswaran. Further on perusal of Ex.P19 the ESI Identity card issued by the Branch Office, ESI Corporation. Periyanaickenpalayam, Coimbatore it is evident that all the three petitioners were shown as wife and daughters of the deceased Kaleeswaran and the photographs of the petitioners is also pasted in the ESI Identity card to show that the petitioners are the legal heirs and dependents of deceased Kaleeswaran. Hence as there is no contra evidence available as against this aspect this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled for compensation. 10 POINT No.4 :- If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioner? 18.The object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or dependent of the deceased. The compensation should commensurate to the loss of dependency suffered by the legal representatives. Therefore it should be just and reasonable, proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 19.In a given case, if the claim made is so exorbitant or if the claim made is contrary to ground realities, the Tribunal may not accept the claim and may proceed to determine the possible income by resorting to some guess work, which may include the ground realities prevailing at the relevant point of time. It depends on the facts of each case. 20.The case of the petitioners is that at the time of accident the deceased was working as a security at Roots horn Company, Rakkipalayam, Coimbatore and was earning a sum of Rs.10,000/- p.m. Further the petitioners would contend that the 1st petitioner is the housewife, and the 2nd petitioners are perusing their education and the 3rd petitioner is the minor and the deceased alone was their only breadwinner of the family. Further case of the petitioners is that at the age of 41 the 1st petitioner has lost her lovable husband and the two unmarried daughters have lost their father and vendor and the sudden loss of the deceased has caused a great impact on their life which cannot be compensated by any metes; Further in order to contend that support the petitioner have also examined Junior Manager of ROOTS INDUSTRIES INDIA LIMITED, Thoppampatti, Coimbatore. On perusal of the deposition of PW-3 it is evident that the deceased was employed at ROOTS INDUSTRIES INDIA LIMITED, Thoppampatti Coimbatore as security from 06.05.2003 and PW-3 also marked 11 attendance register vide Ex.P23 and the salary slip vide Ex.P24. On perusal of Ex.P24 it is evident that a sum of Rs.7,500/- was paid as a monthly salary to the deceased. Further on perusal of the Ex.P23 and Ex.P19 it is evident that the deceased was working under ROOTS INDUSTRIES INDIA LIMITED, Coimbatore and he was covered under the ESI Act and the ESI authorities have also inspected the records of the management and they have also signed in the attendance Register. 21.In respect of the age of the deceased the petitioners have marked the driving license of the deceased wherein the date of birth is shown as 01.05.1967 and Ex.P19 also says that the deceased was born in the year 1967. The petitioners have also stating the deceased was aged in the 48 years at the time of death. Therefore the age of the deceased is fixed as 48. On perusal of Ex.P24 and deposition of PW-3 it is evident that on 06.05.2015 he joined as security and worked for 14 days and unfortunately he met with an accident and died. Hence, as 14 days salary the concerned Company has paid a sum of Rs.7,500/- to the 1st petitioner and PW3 would depose that the deceased joint as a security monthly salary of Rs.7,500/-. Taking into consideration of Ex.P24 the monthly income of the deceased is fixed as Rs.7,500/- . 22.In respect of loss of consortium to the 1st Petitioner, the Honourable Supreme Court had in a judgment reported in 2013 ACJ 1403 in the case between Rajesh and Others Vs Rajbir Singh in Para 20 that; “20. We may therefore, revisit the practice of awarding compensation under conventional heads, Loss of Consortium to the spouse, Loss of Love, care and guidance to children and Funeral Expenses. It may be noted that the sum of Rs.2,500/- to Rs.10,000/- in those heads was fixed several decades ago and having regard to inflation factor, the some needs to be increased. In Sarla Varma's case (supra), it was held that Compensation for Loss of Consortium should be in the range of Rs.5,000/- to Rs.10,000/- In legal parlance, 'consortium' is the right of the spouse 12 to the Company, care, help, comfort, guidance, society, solace, affection and sexual relations with his or her mate. That non-pecuniary head of damages has not been properly understood by our Courts. The Loss of Companionship, Love, Care and Protection, etc., the spouse is entitled to get, has to be compensated appropriately. The Concept of Non-Pecuniary Damage for Loss of Consortium' is one of the major head of award of Compensation in other parts of the world more particularly in the United States of America, Australia, etc., English Courts have also recognized the right of a spouse to get Compensation even during the period of temporary disablement. By Loss of Consortium, the Courts have made an attempt to compensate the loss of spouse's affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations during the future years. Unlike the Compensation awarded in other countries and other jurisdictions, since the Legal Heirs are otherwise adequately compensated for the Pecuniary Loss,it would not be proper to award a major amount under the head. Hence, we are of the view that it would only be just and reasonable that the Courts award at least rupees one lakh for Loss of Consortium”. And following the above judgment in the present case considering the age of the 1st petitioner this court is of the considered view that she is entitled for a sum of Rs.1,000,000/- as consortium. 23.By applying the multiplier as per the dictum lay down s by the Sarala Varma case the multiplier is 13 which is proper multiplier for accessing the deceased. 24.As per the law lay down in Sarala Varma case 1/3rd of the total income is deducted for personal income . As such the calculation of loss of income is calculate as follows ; Monthly salary of the deceased is Rs.7,500/- and future prospectus is 30 % of the salary which comes to Rs.2,250/- total comes to Rs.9,750/- and the multiplier is 13. 13 Therefore, Rs.9,750/- x 13 x 12 = 15,21,000/- and personal expenses 1/3rd which comes to 5,07,000/-. After deduction of the personal expenses of Rs.5,07,000/- from Rs.15,21,000/- the loss of income comes to Rs. 10,14,000/- . 25.The petitioner are entitled for the heads of compensation is as follows ; Sl.No. Heads Amount 1Loss of Income Rs.10,14,000/- 2 Loss of consortium (1st Petitioner) Rs. 1,00,000/- 3 Loss of Love and Affection and guidance to the 2nd and 3rd petitioners (Each Rs.2,00,000/) Rs. 4,00,000/- 4 Funeral Expenses Rs. 20,000/- 5 Damages to clothing & Vehicle Rs. 10,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs. 15,44,000/- 26. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.5,44,000/- of claim amount and the 2nd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- of claim amount and the minor 3rd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- of claim amount. Hence point No.4 is answered accordingly. In the result , the Respondents 1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.15,44,000/- with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.5,44,000/- with interest, and the 2nd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of 14 Rs.5,00,000/- with interest and the 3rd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- with interest. After deposit, the 1st Petitioner is permitted to withdraw her entire share amount with interest immediately and the 2nd Petitioner is permitted to withdraw a sum of Rs.2,50,000/- with interest and balance of Rs.2,50,000/- is to be deposited in any nationalised bank for three years; and the entire share amount of the minor 3rd Petitioner is to be deposited in any nationalised bank till she attain majority and the 1st Petitioner is permitted to withdraw the interest only from the minor 3rd Petitioner's account and spend for her education and welfare.

POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending Van bearing its Registration No. T.N. 69 S 6495 on 21-02-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 4.

On behalf of the defendants no witness has been examined. On behalf of the respondents 4 documents were marked as Ex.R1 to R4. POINT No.1: Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending Van bearing its Registration No. T.N. 69 S 6495 on 21-02-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 7.The case of the petitioner is that on 21-02-2015 at about 3.30 a.m the accident took place near Government High School, Annur to Avinashi Road, Nagammapudur, Annur, Coimbatore. Further they would contend that the deceased was riding in a motor cycle bearing Registration No. TN 40 H 5346 from east to west and when he was proceeding near the above said Government High School the offending van bearing registration No. TN 69 S 6495 driven by the 1st respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. 8.Further they would contend that due to the said accident the deceased sustained heavy injuries all over his body and immediately he was taken to SMF hospital Annur for first aid and admitted for further treatment in CMC Hospital, Coimbatore and on 27-02-2015 he died without responding to the treatment given to him. 6 9.Whereas the contention of the 3rd respondent is that the 1st respondent have no badge to drive the pick up van bearing registration No. TN 69 S 6495 at the time of accident. Hence the respondents 1 and 2 have violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and hence the 3rd respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. 10.The 3rd respondent would further contend that the driver of the offending vehicle and the rider of the motor cycle bearing registration NO. N 40 H 5346 have not so far furnished the details of the accident the R.C. Book and driving license particulars with the 3rd respondent as per the terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy.

Hence the 3rd respondent would contend that there is no negligence on the part of the 1st respondent and contributing negligence is attracted in the case in hand. 11.This Court has given its anxious consideration on the rival contentions of both the parties. On perusal of Ex.P2 F.I.R, it reveals that the case is registered as against the 1st respondent for the offences under 279, 337 I.P.C., and Ex.P3 reveals the case of accident. Further on perusal of Ex.P4 it reveals that the offending vehicle was driven by the 1st respondent and the said vehicle is owned by the 2nd respondent. On further perusal it reveals that though R1 was in possession of driving licensing however badge was not obtained by him. Though the 3rd respondent would contend that R1 was not in possession of any badge except the bare statement found in the counter and Ex.P4 there is no evidence available to show that whether any action was initiated or any notice was issued to them in respect of the same. And no one was examined by R3 in this regard. 12.Further on perusal of Ex.P5 it reveals that the deceased was riding the two wheeler and the vehicle was in a good condition. Though in Ex.P5 it is stated that driving license was not produced at the time of inspection it is not the specific case of R3 that the deceased has not at all obtained any driving licence. Further in Ex.P4, P5 it has been categorically 7 mentioned that the accident was not caused due to any mechanical defects of the respective vehicles. 13.Further on perusal of Ex.P6 it reveals that though Ex.P2 F.I.R was registered as against the 1st respondent for the offence under 279 and 337 of I.P.C. Ex.P6 Final Report is laid against the 1st respondent for the offence under 304 (A) I.P.C. Further on perusal of Ex.P8 Post Mortem Certificate the doctor has opined that the deceased would appear to have died of head injury and it's complications and no other adverse remarks are mentioned in it. 14.Further on behalf of the petitioners one Vijayakumar was examined as P.W.2, who is the eye witness to the accident, who would depose that the offending vehicle driven by the 1st respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and the above said evidence was not shaken by the 3rd respondent. Though he was cross examined by R3. Further it is alse relevant to note that the 1st respondent who drove the offending vehicle remained ex-parte though summon was properly served upon him. 15.Further though the 3rd respondent would contend that it is the deceased who drove the vehicle without any license and dashed against the vehicle driven by the 1st respondent no material evidence is available as against the said contention of the 3rd respondent. Therefore contributory negligence cannot be attributed in the case in hand. 16.Therefore taking into consideration of the above said facts and circumstances of the case this Court is of the considered view that the petitioners have prima facie established that it is the 1st respondent who drove the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. Hence Point No. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent. POINT NO.2 : Who is liable to pay compensation? 17.It is admitted fact the 1st respondent is the driver of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the owner of offending vehicle and the 3rd respondent is the insurer of the offending vehicle. Further as Point No. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 8 POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioner? 18.The case of the petitioners is that at the time of accident the deceased was aged about 19 years and he was pursuing his B.S.C IInd Year Graduation at NIFS Coimbatore. Further they would contend that the petitioners are father and mother of the deceased and they have lost their only son who is the future. Further they would contend that the sufferings and sorrows mental agonies and hardships undergone by the petitioners cannot be compensated by any means or kind. However they should be compensated to the extent to which they are practically possible in the material world. Further the petitioners would contend that immediately after the accident the injured was taken to hospital and after one week he died without responding to the best treatment. IN support of their case they have also marked Ex.P7 medical bills, discharge summary. 19.On perusal of records it is admitted fact that the deceased is died due to road accident and Ex.P9 is the death certificate. Based on the death certificate Ex.P10 legal heir ship certificate was issued by the concerned authorities. In respect of the same there is no quarrel between the parties and hence this Court has no hesitation to hold that the petitioners alone are legal heirs and dependence of the deceased. 20.Now coming to the age and income of the deceased Dineshwaran it is admitted fact that the deceased was a student and pursuing his graduation and he was aged about 19 years. ON perusal of Ex.P11 birth certificate wherein it has stated that on 29-03-1995 the deceased was born. And Ex.P12, P13, P14 it reveals that the deceased was pursuing his B.Sc Graduation. 21.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or the dependents of the deceased. Normally the compensation should 9 commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 22.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may proceed to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 23.Therefore taking into consideration of the above the compensation has to be calculated based on the notional income of the deceased. 24.On perusal of Ex.P13 and Ex.P14 identity card of the deceased Dineshwaran which reveals that his date of birth is 29-03-1995 and he was pursuing his B.Sc Graduation in Fire and Industrial safety at Annamalai University. Hence as per the settled law notional income of the deceased is to be fixed depending upon the educational qualification of deceased in arriving the just conclusion of quantum of compensation to the petitioners. The age of the deceased is 19 years. 25.In support of the case of the petitioners they have also relied upon a judgment reported in …. 2017 (1) TNMAC … 220 .. in the case between Kandasamy and others …. Vs..... G. R. Sampath and others …. 26.Hence taking into consideration of the age of the deceased and the education qualification of the deceased a sum of Rs.8,000/-is fixed as notional income of the deceased. 27.As per the latest Judgment Reported in 2017 (2) TN MAC 609 (SC) in the case between National Insurance Company Limited … Vs..... Pranay Sethi and others 40% of the income is taken as addition. Hence 40% of the income comes to Rs.3,200/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.8,000+ Rs.3,200/- which is comes to 10 Rs.11,200/-. Hence s sum of Rs.11,200 /- is fixed as income of the deceased. 28.And as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 18 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court considering the marital status of the deceased 1/3 of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 29.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as the income of the deceased is Rs.11,200/-. Hence Rs.11,200 X 12 X 18 = Rs.24,19,200/- and 1/3rd personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.8,06,400/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs.24,19,200 – Rs.8,06,400 = Rs. 16,12,800/- 30. Further as per the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for funeral expenses, and a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for loss of estate, and based on Ex.P7 the medical bills the petitioners are also entitled for a sum, of Rs.51,426 (rounded off ) 31.Though the Ld. Counsel for the respondent would contend that though legal notice was issued to R1 and R2 directing them to produce the driving license of R1they failed to produce the same and hence they would contend that they are not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners and further they would contend that the deceased is also responsible for the accident and hence contributory negligence is to be attributed on the deceased. However the said contention of the R3 is not proved in the manner known to law. Hence the contention of the R3 cannot be countenanced with. 32.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.16,12,800/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/- 3 Funeral Expanes Rs. 15,000/- 4 Medical Bills Rs. 51,426 TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.16,94,226/- 11 From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.16,94,226 /-towards compensation and the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.16,94,226 /-with interest.

POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending Van bearing its Registration No. T.N. 69 S 6495 on 21-02-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 4. If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 6.On behalf of the petitioner, the 1st petitioner was examined as PW-1, and one Vijayakumar was examined as PW-2, and 19 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P19. On behalf of the defendants no witness has been examined. On behalf of the respondents 4 documents were marked as Ex.R1 to R4. POINT No.1: Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending Van bearing its Registration No. T.N. 69 S 6495 on 21-02-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 7.The case of the petitioner is that on 21-02-2015 at about 3.30 a.m the accident took place near Government High School, Annur to Avinashi Road, Nagammapudur, Annur, Coimbatore. Further they would contend that the deceased was riding in a motor cycle bearing Registration No. TN 40 H 5346 from east to west and when he was proceeding near the above said Government High School the offending van bearing registration No. TN 69 S 6495 driven by the 1st respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. 8.Further they would contend that due to the said accident the deceased sustained heavy injuries all over his body and immediately he was taken to SMF hospital Annur for first aid and admitted for further treatment in CMC Hospital, Coimbatore and on 27-02-2015 he died without responding to the treatment given to him. 6 9.Whereas the contention of the 3rd respondent is that the 1st respondent have no badge to drive the pick up van bearing registration No. TN 69 S 6495 at the time of accident. Hence the respondents 1 and 2 have violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and hence the 3rd respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. 10.The 3rd respondent would further contend that the driver of the offending vehicle and the rider of the motor cycle bearing registration NO. N 40 H 5346 have not so far furnished the details of the accident the R.C. Book and driving license particulars with the 3rd respondent as per the terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy. The 3rd respondent would further contend that the driver of the offending vehicle was slowly driving the said vehicle following the traffic rules however it is the deceased Dineshwaran negligently drove the motor cycle without having driving license and dashed against the van driven by the 1st respondent due to which the accident occurred. Hence the 3rd respondent would contend that there is no negligence on the part of the 1st respondent and contributing negligence is attracted in the case in hand. 11.This Court has given its anxious consideration on the rival contentions of both the parties. On perusal of Ex.P2 F.I.R, it reveals that the case is registered as against the 1st respondent for the offences under 279, 337 I.P.C., and Ex.P3 reveals the case of accident. Further on perusal of Ex.P4 it reveals that the offending vehicle was driven by the 1st respondent and the said vehicle is owned by the 2nd respondent. On further perusal it reveals that though R1 was in possession of driving licensing however badge was not obtained by him. Though the 3rd respondent would contend that R1 was not in possession of any badge except the bare statement found in the counter and Ex.P4 there is no evidence available to show that whether any action was initiated or any notice was issued to them in respect of the same. And no one was examined by R3 in this regard. 12.Further on perusal of Ex.P5 it reveals that the deceased was riding the two wheeler and the vehicle was in a good condition. Though in Ex.P5 it is stated that driving license was not produced at the time of inspection it is not the specific case of R3 that the deceased has not at all obtained any driving licence. Further in Ex.P4, P5 it has been categorically 7 mentioned that the accident was not caused due to any mechanical defects of the respective vehicles. 13.Further on perusal of Ex.P6 it reveals that though Ex.P2 F.I.R was registered as against the 1st respondent for the offence under 279 and 337 of I.P.C. Ex.P6 Final Report is laid against the 1st respondent for the offence under 304 (A) I.P.C. Further on perusal of Ex.P8 Post Mortem Certificate the doctor has opined that the deceased would appear to have died of head injury and it's complications and no other adverse remarks are mentioned in it. 14.Further on behalf of the petitioners one Vijayakumar was examined as P.W.2, who is the eye witness to the accident, who would depose that the offending vehicle driven by the 1st respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and the above said evidence was not shaken by the 3rd respondent. Though he was cross examined by R3. Further it is alse relevant to note that the 1st respondent who drove the offending vehicle remained ex-parte though summon was properly served upon him. 15.Further though the 3rd respondent would contend that it is the deceased who drove the vehicle without any license and dashed against the vehicle driven by the 1st respondent no material evidence is available as against the said contention of the 3rd respondent. Therefore contributory negligence cannot be attributed in the case in hand. 16.Therefore taking into consideration of the above said facts and circumstances of the case this Court is of the considered view that the petitioners have prima facie established that it is the 1st respondent who drove the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. Hence Point No. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent. POINT NO.2 : Who is liable to pay compensation? 17.It is admitted fact the 1st respondent is the driver of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the owner of offending vehicle and the 3rd respondent is the insurer of the offending vehicle. Further as Point No. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 8 POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioner? 18.The case of the petitioners is that at the time of accident the deceased was aged about 19 years and he was pursuing his B.S.C IInd Year Graduation at NIFS Coimbatore. Further they would contend that the petitioners are father and mother of the deceased and they have lost their only son who is the future. Further they would contend that the sufferings and sorrows mental agonies and hardships undergone by the petitioners cannot be compensated by any means or kind. However they should be compensated to the extent to which they are practically possible in the material world. Further the petitioners would contend that immediately after the accident the injured was taken to hospital and after one week he died without responding to the best treatment. IN support of their case they have also marked Ex.P7 medical bills, discharge summary. 19.On perusal of records it is admitted fact that the deceased is died due to road accident and Ex.P9 is the death certificate. Based on the death certificate Ex.P10 legal heir ship certificate was issued by the concerned authorities. In respect of the same there is no quarrel between the parties and hence this Court has no hesitation to hold that the petitioners alone are legal heirs and dependence of the deceased. 20.Now coming to the age and income of the deceased Dineshwaran it is admitted fact that the deceased was a student and pursuing his graduation and he was aged about 19 years. ON perusal of Ex.P11 birth certificate wherein it has stated that on 29-03-1995 the deceased was born. And Ex.P12, P13, P14 it reveals that the deceased was pursuing his B.Sc Graduation. 21.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or the dependents of the deceased. Normally the compensation should 9 commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 22.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may proceed to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 23.Therefore taking into consideration of the above the compensation has to be calculated based on the notional income of the deceased. 24.On perusal of Ex.P13 and Ex.P14 identity card of the deceased Dineshwaran which reveals that his date of birth is 29-03-1995 and he was pursuing his B.Sc Graduation in Fire and Industrial safety at Annamalai University. Hence as per the settled law notional income of the deceased is to be fixed depending upon the educational qualification of deceased in arriving the just conclusion of quantum of compensation to the petitioners. The age of the deceased is 19 years. 25.In support of the case of the petitioners they have also relied upon a judgment reported in …. 2017 (1) TNMAC … 220 .. in the case between Kandasamy and others …. Vs..... G. R. Sampath and others …. 26.Hence taking into consideration of the age of the deceased and the education qualification of the deceased a sum of Rs.8,000/-is fixed as notional income of the deceased. 27.As per the latest Judgment Reported in 2017 (2) TN MAC 609 (SC) in the case between National Insurance Company Limited … Vs..... Pranay Sethi and others 40% of the income is taken as addition. Hence 40% of the income comes to Rs.3,200/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.8,000+ Rs.3,200/- which is comes to 10 Rs.11,200/-. Hence s sum of Rs.11,200 /- is fixed as income of the deceased. 28.And as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 18 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court considering the marital status of the deceased 1/3 of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 29.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as the income of the deceased is Rs.11,200/-. Hence Rs.11,200 X 12 X 18 = Rs.24,19,200/- and 1/3rd personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.8,06,400/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs.24,19,200 – Rs.8,06,400 = Rs. 16,12,800/- 30. Further as per the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for funeral expenses, and a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for loss of estate, and based on Ex.P7 the medical bills the petitioners are also entitled for a sum, of Rs.51,426 (rounded off ) 31.Though the Ld. Counsel for the respondent would contend that though legal notice was issued to R1 and R2 directing them to produce the driving license of R1they failed to produce the same and hence they would contend that they are not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners and further they would contend that the deceased is also responsible for the accident and hence contributory negligence is to be attributed on the deceased. However the said contention of the R3 is not proved in the manner known to law. Hence the contention of the R3 cannot be countenanced with. 32.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.16,12,800/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/- 3 Funeral Expanes Rs. 15,000/- 4 Medical Bills Rs. 51,426 TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.16,94,226/- 11 From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.16,94,226 /-towards compensation and the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.16,94,226 /-with interest. In the result, the Respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.16,94,226/- with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. And out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.5,00,000/- of claim amount and the 2nd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.11,94,226/- of claim amount .

POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending Van bearing its Registration No. T.N. 69 S 6495 on 21-02-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 4.

On behalf of the defendants no witness has been examined. On behalf of the respondents 4 documents were marked as Ex.R1 to R4. POINT No.1: Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending Van bearing its Registration No. T.N. 69 S 6495 on 21-02-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 7.The case of the petitioner is that on 21-02-2015 at about 3.30 a.m the accident took place near Government High School, Annur to Avinashi Road, Nagammapudur, Annur, Coimbatore. Further they would contend that the deceased was riding in a motor cycle bearing Registration No. TN 40 H 5346 from east to west and when he was proceeding near the above said Government High School the offending van bearing registration No. TN 69 S 6495 driven by the 1st respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. 8.Further they would contend that due to the said accident the deceased sustained heavy injuries all over his body and immediately he was taken to SMF hospital Annur for first aid and admitted for further treatment in CMC Hospital, Coimbatore and on 27-02-2015 he died without responding to the treatment given to him. 6 9.Whereas the contention of the 3rd respondent is that the 1st respondent have no badge to drive the pick up van bearing registration No. TN 69 S 6495 at the time of accident. Hence the respondents 1 and 2 have violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and hence the 3rd respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. 10.The 3rd respondent would further contend that the driver of the offending vehicle and the rider of the motor cycle bearing registration NO. N 40 H 5346 have not so far furnished the details of the accident the R.C. Book and driving license particulars with the 3rd respondent as per the terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy. The 3rd respondent would further contend that the driver of the offending vehicle was slowly driving the said vehicle following the traffic rules however it is the deceased Dineshwaran negligently drove the motor cycle without having driving license and dashed against the van driven by the 1st respondent due to which the accident occurred. Hence the 3rd respondent would contend that there is no negligence on the part of the 1st respondent and contributing negligence is attracted in the case in hand. 11.This Court has given its anxious consideration on the rival contentions of both the parties. On perusal of Ex.P2 F.I.R, it reveals that the case is registered as against the 1st respondent for the offences under 279, 337 I.P.C., and Ex.P3 reveals the case of accident. Further on perusal of Ex.P4 it reveals that the offending vehicle was driven by the 1st respondent and the said vehicle is owned by the 2nd respondent. On further perusal it reveals that though R1 was in possession of driving licensing however badge was not obtained by him. Though the 3rd respondent would contend that R1 was not in possession of any badge except the bare statement found in the counter and Ex.P4 there is no evidence available to show that whether any action was initiated or any notice was issued to them in respect of the same. And no one was examined by R3 in this regard. 12.Further on perusal of Ex.P5 it reveals that the deceased was riding the two wheeler and the vehicle was in a good condition. Though in Ex.P5 it is stated that driving license was not produced at the time of inspection it is not the specific case of R3 that the deceased has not at all obtained any driving licence. Further in Ex.P4, P5 it has been categorically 7 mentioned that the accident was not caused due to any mechanical defects of the respective vehicles. 13.Further on perusal of Ex.P6 it reveals that though Ex.P2 F.I.R was registered as against the 1st respondent for the offence under 279 and 337 of I.P.C. Ex.P6 Final Report is laid against the 1st respondent for the offence under 304 (A) I.P.C. Further on perusal of Ex.P8 Post Mortem Certificate the doctor has opined that the deceased would appear to have died of head injury and it's complications and no other adverse remarks are mentioned in it. 14.Further on behalf of the petitioners one Vijayakumar was examined as P.W.2, who is the eye witness to the accident, who would depose that the offending vehicle driven by the 1st respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and the above said evidence was not shaken by the 3rd respondent. Though he was cross examined by R3. Further it is alse relevant to note that the 1st respondent who drove the offending vehicle remained ex-parte though summon was properly served upon him. 15.Further though the 3rd respondent would contend that it is the deceased who drove the vehicle without any license and dashed against the vehicle driven by the 1st respondent no material evidence is available as against the said contention of the 3rd respondent. Therefore contributory negligence cannot be attributed in the case in hand. 16.Therefore taking into consideration of the above said facts and circumstances of the case this Court is of the considered view that the petitioners have prima facie established that it is the 1st respondent who drove the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. Hence Point No. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent. POINT NO.2 : Who is liable to pay compensation? 17.It is admitted fact the 1st respondent is the driver of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the owner of offending vehicle and the 3rd respondent is the insurer of the offending vehicle. Further as Point No. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 8 POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioner? 18.The case of the petitioners is that at the time of accident the deceased was aged about 19 years and he was pursuing his B.S.C IInd Year Graduation at NIFS Coimbatore. Further they would contend that the petitioners are father and mother of the deceased and they have lost their only son who is the future. Further they would contend that the sufferings and sorrows mental agonies and hardships undergone by the petitioners cannot be compensated by any means or kind. However they should be compensated to the extent to which they are practically possible in the material world. Further the petitioners would contend that immediately after the accident the injured was taken to hospital and after one week he died without responding to the best treatment. IN support of their case they have also marked Ex.P7 medical bills, discharge summary. 19.On perusal of records it is admitted fact that the deceased is died due to road accident and Ex.P9 is the death certificate. Based on the death certificate Ex.P10 legal heir ship certificate was issued by the concerned authorities. In respect of the same there is no quarrel between the parties and hence this Court has no hesitation to hold that the petitioners alone are legal heirs and dependence of the deceased. 20.Now coming to the age and income of the deceased Dineshwaran it is admitted fact that the deceased was a student and pursuing his graduation and he was aged about 19 years. ON perusal of Ex.P11 birth certificate wherein it has stated that on 29-03-1995 the deceased was born. And Ex.P12, P13, P14 it reveals that the deceased was pursuing his B.Sc Graduation. 21.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or the dependents of the deceased. Normally the compensation should 9 commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 22.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may proceed to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 23.Therefore taking into consideration of the above the compensation has to be calculated based on the notional income of the deceased. 24.On perusal of Ex.P13 and Ex.P14 identity card of the deceased Dineshwaran which reveals that his date of birth is 29-03-1995 and he was pursuing his B.Sc Graduation in Fire and Industrial safety at Annamalai University. Hence as per the settled law notional income of the deceased is to be fixed depending upon the educational qualification of deceased in arriving the just conclusion of quantum of compensation to the petitioners. The age of the deceased is 19 years. 25.In support of the case of the petitioners they have also relied upon a judgment reported in …. 2017 (1) TNMAC … 220 .. in the case between Kandasamy and others …. Vs..... G. R. Sampath and others …. 26.Hence taking into consideration of the age of the deceased and the education qualification of the deceased a sum of Rs.8,000/-is fixed as notional income of the deceased. 27.As per the latest Judgment Reported in 2017 (2) TN MAC 609 (SC) in the case between National Insurance Company Limited … Vs..... Pranay Sethi and others 40% of the income is taken as addition. Hence 40% of the income comes to Rs.3,200/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.8,000+ Rs.3,200/- which is comes to 10 Rs.11,200/-. Hence s sum of Rs.11,200 /- is fixed as income of the deceased. 28.And as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 18 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court considering the marital status of the deceased 1/3 of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 29.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as the income of the deceased is Rs.11,200/-. Hence Rs.11,200 X 12 X 18 = Rs.24,19,200/- and 1/3rd personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.8,06,400/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs.24,19,200 – Rs.8,06,400 = Rs. 16,12,800/- 30. Further as per the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for funeral expenses, and a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for loss of estate, and based on Ex.P7 the medical bills the petitioners are also entitled for a sum, of Rs.51,426 (rounded off ) 31.Though the Ld. Counsel for the respondent would contend that though legal notice was issued to R1 and R2 directing them to produce the driving license of R1they failed to produce the same and hence they would contend that they are not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners and further they would contend that the deceased is also responsible for the accident and hence contributory negligence is to be attributed on the deceased. However the said contention of the R3 is not proved in the manner known to law. Hence the contention of the R3 cannot be countenanced with. 32.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.16,12,800/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/- 3 Funeral Expanes Rs. 15,000/- 4 Medical Bills Rs. 51,426 TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.16,94,226/- 11 From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.16,94,226 /-towards compensation and the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.16,94,226 /-with interest. In the result, the Respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.16,94,226/- with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. And out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.5,00,000/- of claim amount and the 2nd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.11,94,226/- of claim amount . After deposit, the petitioners are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount with interest immediately. The court fee of Rs.16,315/- is ordered to be paid by the Petitioners within one month. The Advocate fees is fixed at Rs.23,942/- to be paid by the respondents by a separate cheque.

Hence the respondents 1 and 2 have violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and hence the 3rd respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. 10.The 3rd respondent would further contend that the driver of the offending vehicle and the rider of the motor cycle bearing registration NO. N 40 H 5346 have not so far furnished the details of the accident the R.C. Book and driving license particulars with the 3rd respondent as per the terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy. The 3rd respondent would further contend that the driver of the offending vehicle was slowly driving the said vehicle following the traffic rules however it is the deceased Dineshwaran negligently drove the motor cycle without having driving license and dashed against the van driven by the 1st respondent due to which the accident occurred. Hence the 3rd respondent would contend that there is no negligence on the part of the 1st respondent and contributing negligence is attracted in the case in hand. 11.This Court has given its anxious consideration on the rival contentions of both the parties. On perusal of Ex.P2 F.I.R, it reveals that the case is registered as against the 1st respondent for the offences under 279, 337 I.P.C., and Ex.P3 reveals the case of accident. Further on perusal of Ex.P4 it reveals that the offending vehicle was driven by the 1st respondent and the said vehicle is owned by the 2nd respondent. On further perusal it reveals that though R1 was in possession of driving licensing however badge was not obtained by him. Though the 3rd respondent would contend that R1 was not in possession of any badge except the bare statement found in the counter and Ex.P4 there is no evidence available to show that whether any action was initiated or any notice was issued to them in respect of the same. And no one was examined by R3 in this regard. 12.Further on perusal of Ex.P5 it reveals that the deceased was riding the two wheeler and the vehicle was in a good condition. Though in Ex.P5 it is stated that driving license was not produced at the time of inspection it is not the specific case of R3 that the deceased has not at all obtained any driving licence. Further in Ex.P4, P5 it has been categorically 7 mentioned that the accident was not caused due to any mechanical defects of the respective vehicles. 13.Further on perusal of Ex.P6 it reveals that though Ex.P2 F.I.R was registered as against the 1st respondent for the offence under 279 and 337 of I.P.C. Ex.P6 Final Report is laid against the 1st respondent for the offence under 304 (A) I.P.C. Further on perusal of Ex.P8 Post Mortem Certificate the doctor has opined that the deceased would appear to have died of head injury and it's complications and no other adverse remarks are mentioned in it. 14.Further on behalf of the petitioners one Vijayakumar was examined as P.W.2, who is the eye witness to the accident, who would depose that the offending vehicle driven by the 1st respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and the above said evidence was not shaken by the 3rd respondent. Though he was cross examined by R3. Further it is alse relevant to note that the 1st respondent who drove the offending vehicle remained ex-parte though summon was properly served upon him. 15.Further though the 3rd respondent would contend that it is the deceased who drove the vehicle without any license and dashed against the vehicle driven by the 1st respondent no material evidence is available as against the said contention of the 3rd respondent. Therefore contributory negligence cannot be attributed in the case in hand. 16.Therefore taking into consideration of the above said facts and circumstances of the case this Court is of the considered view that the petitioners have prima facie established that it is the 1st respondent who drove the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. Hence Point No. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent. POINT NO.2 : Who is liable to pay compensation? 17.It is admitted fact the 1st respondent is the driver of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the owner of offending vehicle and the 3rd respondent is the insurer of the offending vehicle. Further as Point No. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 8 POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioner? 18.The case of the petitioners is that at the time of accident the deceased was aged about 19 years and he was pursuing his B.S.C IInd Year Graduation at NIFS Coimbatore. Further they would contend that the petitioners are father and mother of the deceased and they have lost their only son who is the future. Further they would contend that the sufferings and sorrows mental agonies and hardships undergone by the petitioners cannot be compensated by any means or kind. However they should be compensated to the extent to which they are practically possible in the material world. Further the petitioners would contend that immediately after the accident the injured was taken to hospital and after one week he died without responding to the best treatment. IN support of their case they have also marked Ex.P7 medical bills, discharge summary. 19.On perusal of records it is admitted fact that the deceased is died due to road accident and Ex.P9 is the death certificate. Based on the death certificate Ex.P10 legal heir ship certificate was issued by the concerned authorities. In respect of the same there is no quarrel between the parties and hence this Court has no hesitation to hold that the petitioners alone are legal heirs and dependence of the deceased. 20.Now coming to the age and income of the deceased Dineshwaran it is admitted fact that the deceased was a student and pursuing his graduation and he was aged about 19 years. ON perusal of Ex.P11 birth certificate wherein it has stated that on 29-03-1995 the deceased was born. And Ex.P12, P13, P14 it reveals that the deceased was pursuing his B.Sc Graduation. 21.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or the dependents of the deceased. Normally the compensation should 9 commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 22.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may proceed to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 23.Therefore taking into consideration of the above the compensation has to be calculated based on the notional income of the deceased. 24.On perusal of Ex.P13 and Ex.P14 identity card of the deceased Dineshwaran which reveals that his date of birth is 29-03-1995 and he was pursuing his B.Sc Graduation in Fire and Industrial safety at Annamalai University. Hence as per the settled law notional income of the deceased is to be fixed depending upon the educational qualification of deceased in arriving the just conclusion of quantum of compensation to the petitioners. The age of the deceased is 19 years. 25.In support of the case of the petitioners they have also relied upon a judgment reported in …. 2017 (1) TNMAC … 220 .. in the case between Kandasamy and others …. Vs..... G. R. Sampath and others …. 26.Hence taking into consideration of the age of the deceased and the education qualification of the deceased a sum of Rs.8,000/-is fixed as notional income of the deceased. 27.As per the latest Judgment Reported in 2017 (2) TN MAC 609 (SC) in the case between National Insurance Company Limited … Vs..... Pranay Sethi and others 40% of the income is taken as addition. Hence 40% of the income comes to Rs.3,200/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.8,000+ Rs.3,200/- which is comes to 10 Rs.11,200/-. Hence s sum of Rs.11,200 /- is fixed as income of the deceased. 28.And as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 18 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court considering the marital status of the deceased 1/3 of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 29.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as the income of the deceased is Rs.11,200/-. Hence Rs.11,200 X 12 X 18 = Rs.24,19,200/- and 1/3rd personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.8,06,400/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs.24,19,200 – Rs.8,06,400 = Rs. 16,12,800/- 30. Further as per the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for funeral expenses, and a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for loss of estate, and based on Ex.P7 the medical bills the petitioners are also entitled for a sum, of Rs.51,426 (rounded off ) 31.Though the Ld. Counsel for the respondent would contend that though legal notice was issued to R1 and R2 directing them to produce the driving license of R1they failed to produce the same and hence they would contend that they are not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners and further they would contend that the deceased is also responsible for the accident and hence contributory negligence is to be attributed on the deceased. However the said contention of the R3 is not proved in the manner known to law. Hence the contention of the R3 cannot be countenanced with. 32.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.16,12,800/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/- 3 Funeral Expanes Rs. 15,000/- 4 Medical Bills Rs. 51,426 TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.16,94,226/- 11 From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.16,94,226 /-towards compensation and the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.16,94,226 /-with interest. In the result, the Respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.16,94,226/- with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. And out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.5,00,000/- of claim amount and the 2nd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.11,94,226/- of claim amount . After deposit, the petitioners are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount with interest immediately. The court fee of Rs.16,315/- is ordered to be paid by the Petitioners within one month. The Advocate fees is fixed at Rs.23,942/- to be paid by the respondents by a separate cheque.

Pranay Sethi and others 40% of the income is taken as addition. Hence 40% of the income comes to Rs.3,200/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.8,000+ Rs.3,200/- which is comes to 10 Rs.11,200/-. Hence s sum of Rs.11,200 /- is fixed as income of the deceased. 28.And as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 18 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court considering the marital status of the deceased 1/3 of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 29.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as the income of the deceased is Rs.11,200/-. Hence Rs.11,200 X 12 X 18 = Rs.24,19,200/- and 1/3rd personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.8,06,400/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs.24,19,200 – Rs.8,06,400 = Rs. 16,12,800/- 30. Further as per the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for funeral expenses, and a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for loss of estate, and based on Ex.P7 the medical bills the petitioners are also entitled for a sum, of Rs.51,426 (rounded off ) 31.Though the Ld. Counsel for the respondent would contend that though legal notice was issued to R1 and R2 directing them to produce the driving license of R1they failed to produce the same and hence they would contend that they are not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners and further they would contend that the deceased is also responsible for the accident and hence contributory negligence is to be attributed on the deceased. However the said contention of the R3 is not proved in the manner known to law. Hence the contention of the R3 cannot be countenanced with. 32.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.16,12,800/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/- 3 Funeral Expanes Rs. 15,000/- 4 Medical Bills Rs. 51,426 TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.16,94,226/- 11 From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.16,94,226 /-towards compensation and the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.16,94,226 /-with interest.

POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending Van bearing its Registration No. T.N. 69 S 6495 on 21-02-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 4. If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 6.On behalf of the petitioner, the 1st petitioner was examined as PW-1, and one Vijayakumar was examined as PW-2, and 19 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P19. On behalf of the defendants no witness has been examined. On behalf of the respondents 4 documents were marked as Ex.R1 to R4. POINT No.1: Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending Van bearing its Registration No. T.N. 69 S 6495 on 21-02-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 7.The case of the petitioner is that on 21-02-2015 at about 3.30 a.m the accident took place near Government High School, Annur to Avinashi Road, Nagammapudur, Annur, Coimbatore. Further they would contend that the deceased was riding in a motor cycle bearing Registration No. TN 40 H 5346 from east to west and when he was proceeding near the above said Government High School the offending van bearing registration No. TN 69 S 6495 driven by the 1st respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. 8.Further they would contend that due to the said accident the deceased sustained heavy injuries all over his body and immediately he was taken to SMF hospital Annur for first aid and admitted for further treatment in CMC Hospital, Coimbatore and on 27-02-2015 he died without responding to the treatment given to him. 6 9.Whereas the contention of the 3rd respondent is that the 1st respondent have no badge to drive the pick up van bearing registration No. TN 69 S 6495 at the time of accident. Hence the respondents 1 and 2 have violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and hence the 3rd respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. 10.The 3rd respondent would further contend that the driver of the offending vehicle and the rider of the motor cycle bearing registration NO. N 40 H 5346 have not so far furnished the details of the accident the R.C. Book and driving license particulars with the 3rd respondent as per the terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy. The 3rd respondent would further contend that the driver of the offending vehicle was slowly driving the said vehicle following the traffic rules however it is the deceased Dineshwaran negligently drove the motor cycle without having driving license and dashed against the van driven by the 1st respondent due to which the accident occurred. Hence the 3rd respondent would contend that there is no negligence on the part of the 1st respondent and contributing negligence is attracted in the case in hand. 11.This Court has given its anxious consideration on the rival contentions of both the parties. On perusal of Ex.P2 F.I.R, it reveals that the case is registered as against the 1st respondent for the offences under 279, 337 I.P.C., and Ex.P3 reveals the case of accident. Further on perusal of Ex.P4 it reveals that the offending vehicle was driven by the 1st respondent and the said vehicle is owned by the 2nd respondent. On further perusal it reveals that though R1 was in possession of driving licensing however badge was not obtained by him. Though the 3rd respondent would contend that R1 was not in possession of any badge except the bare statement found in the counter and Ex.P4 there is no evidence available to show that whether any action was initiated or any notice was issued to them in respect of the same. And no one was examined by R3 in this regard. 12.Further on perusal of Ex.P5 it reveals that the deceased was riding the two wheeler and the vehicle was in a good condition. Though in Ex.P5 it is stated that driving license was not produced at the time of inspection it is not the specific case of R3 that the deceased has not at all obtained any driving licence. Further in Ex.P4, P5 it has been categorically 7 mentioned that the accident was not caused due to any mechanical defects of the respective vehicles. 13.Further on perusal of Ex.P6 it reveals that though Ex.P2 F.I.R was registered as against the 1st respondent for the offence under 279 and 337 of I.P.C. Ex.P6 Final Report is laid against the 1st respondent for the offence under 304 (A) I.P.C. Further on perusal of Ex.P8 Post Mortem Certificate the doctor has opined that the deceased would appear to have died of head injury and it's complications and no other adverse remarks are mentioned in it. 14.Further on behalf of the petitioners one Vijayakumar was examined as P.W.2, who is the eye witness to the accident, who would depose that the offending vehicle driven by the 1st respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and the above said evidence was not shaken by the 3rd respondent. Though he was cross examined by R3. Further it is alse relevant to note that the 1st respondent who drove the offending vehicle remained ex-parte though summon was properly served upon him. 15.Further though the 3rd respondent would contend that it is the deceased who drove the vehicle without any license and dashed against the vehicle driven by the 1st respondent no material evidence is available as against the said contention of the 3rd respondent. Therefore contributory negligence cannot be attributed in the case in hand. 16.Therefore taking into consideration of the above said facts and circumstances of the case this Court is of the considered view that the petitioners have prima facie established that it is the 1st respondent who drove the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. Hence Point No. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent. POINT NO.2 : Who is liable to pay compensation? 17.It is admitted fact the 1st respondent is the driver of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the owner of offending vehicle and the 3rd respondent is the insurer of the offending vehicle. Further as Point No. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 8 POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioner? 18.The case of the petitioners is that at the time of accident the deceased was aged about 19 years and he was pursuing his B.S.C IInd Year Graduation at NIFS Coimbatore. Further they would contend that the petitioners are father and mother of the deceased and they have lost their only son who is the future. Further they would contend that the sufferings and sorrows mental agonies and hardships undergone by the petitioners cannot be compensated by any means or kind. However they should be compensated to the extent to which they are practically possible in the material world. Further the petitioners would contend that immediately after the accident the injured was taken to hospital and after one week he died without responding to the best treatment. IN support of their case they have also marked Ex.P7 medical bills, discharge summary. 19.On perusal of records it is admitted fact that the deceased is died due to road accident and Ex.P9 is the death certificate. Based on the death certificate Ex.P10 legal heir ship certificate was issued by the concerned authorities. In respect of the same there is no quarrel between the parties and hence this Court has no hesitation to hold that the petitioners alone are legal heirs and dependence of the deceased. 20.Now coming to the age and income of the deceased Dineshwaran it is admitted fact that the deceased was a student and pursuing his graduation and he was aged about 19 years. ON perusal of Ex.P11 birth certificate wherein it has stated that on 29-03-1995 the deceased was born. And Ex.P12, P13, P14 it reveals that the deceased was pursuing his B.Sc Graduation. 21.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or the dependents of the deceased. Normally the compensation should 9 commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 22.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may proceed to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 23.Therefore taking into consideration of the above the compensation has to be calculated based on the notional income of the deceased. 24.On perusal of Ex.P13 and Ex.P14 identity card of the deceased Dineshwaran which reveals that his date of birth is 29-03-1995 and he was pursuing his B.Sc Graduation in Fire and Industrial safety at Annamalai University. Hence as per the settled law notional income of the deceased is to be fixed depending upon the educational qualification of deceased in arriving the just conclusion of quantum of compensation to the petitioners. The age of the deceased is 19 years. 25.In support of the case of the petitioners they have also relied upon a judgment reported in …. 2017 (1) TNMAC … 220 .. in the case between Kandasamy and others …. Vs..... G. R. Sampath and others …. 26.Hence taking into consideration of the age of the deceased and the education qualification of the deceased a sum of Rs.8,000/-is fixed as notional income of the deceased. 27.As per the latest Judgment Reported in 2017 (2) TN MAC 609 (SC) in the case between National Insurance Company Limited … Vs..... Pranay Sethi and others 40% of the income is taken as addition. Hence 40% of the income comes to Rs.3,200/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.8,000+ Rs.3,200/- which is comes to 10 Rs.11,200/-. Hence s sum of Rs.11,200 /- is fixed as income of the deceased. 28.And as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 18 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court considering the marital status of the deceased 1/3 of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 29.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as the income of the deceased is Rs.11,200/-. Hence Rs.11,200 X 12 X 18 = Rs.24,19,200/- and 1/3rd personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.8,06,400/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs.24,19,200 – Rs.8,06,400 = Rs. 16,12,800/- 30. Further as per the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for funeral expenses, and a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for loss of estate, and based on Ex.P7 the medical bills the petitioners are also entitled for a sum, of Rs.51,426 (rounded off ) 31.Though the Ld. Counsel for the respondent would contend that though legal notice was issued to R1 and R2 directing them to produce the driving license of R1they failed to produce the same and hence they would contend that they are not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners and further they would contend that the deceased is also responsible for the accident and hence contributory negligence is to be attributed on the deceased. However the said contention of the R3 is not proved in the manner known to law. Hence the contention of the R3 cannot be countenanced with. 32.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.16,12,800/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/- 3 Funeral Expanes Rs. 15,000/- 4 Medical Bills Rs. 51,426 TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.16,94,226/- 11 From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.16,94,226 /-towards compensation and the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.16,94,226 /-with interest. In the result, the Respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.16,94,226/- with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. And out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.5,00,000/- of claim amount and the 2nd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.11,94,226/- of claim amount . After deposit, the petitioners are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount with interest immediately. The court fee of Rs.16,315/- is ordered to be paid by the Petitioners within one month. The Advocate fees is fixed at Rs.23,942/- to be paid by the respondents by a separate cheque.

POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending Van bearing its Registration No. T.N. 69 S 6495 on 21-02-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 4. If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 6.On behalf of the petitioner, the 1st petitioner was examined as PW-1, and one Vijayakumar was examined as PW-2, and 19 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P19. On behalf of the defendants no witness has been examined. On behalf of the respondents 4 documents were marked as Ex.R1 to R4. POINT No.1: Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending Van bearing its Registration No. T.N. 69 S 6495 on 21-02-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 7.The case of the petitioner is that on 21-02-2015 at about 3.30 a.m the accident took place near Government High School, Annur to Avinashi Road, Nagammapudur, Annur, Coimbatore. Further they would contend that the deceased was riding in a motor cycle bearing Registration No. TN 40 H 5346 from east to west and when he was proceeding near the above said Government High School the offending van bearing registration No. TN 69 S 6495 driven by the 1st respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. 8.Further they would contend that due to the said accident the deceased sustained heavy injuries all over his body and immediately he was taken to SMF hospital Annur for first aid and admitted for further treatment in CMC Hospital, Coimbatore and on 27-02-2015 he died without responding to the treatment given to him. 6 9.Whereas the contention of the 3rd respondent is that the 1st respondent have no badge to drive the pick up van bearing registration No. TN 69 S 6495 at the time of accident. Hence the respondents 1 and 2 have violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and hence the 3rd respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. 10.The 3rd respondent would further contend that the driver of the offending vehicle and the rider of the motor cycle bearing registration NO. N 40 H 5346 have not so far furnished the details of the accident the R.C. Book and driving license particulars with the 3rd respondent as per the terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy. The 3rd respondent would further contend that the driver of the offending vehicle was slowly driving the said vehicle following the traffic rules however it is the deceased Dineshwaran negligently drove the motor cycle without having driving license and dashed against the van driven by the 1st respondent due to which the accident occurred. Hence the 3rd respondent would contend that there is no negligence on the part of the 1st respondent and contributing negligence is attracted in the case in hand. 11.This Court has given its anxious consideration on the rival contentions of both the parties. On perusal of Ex.P2 F.I.R, it reveals that the case is registered as against the 1st respondent for the offences under 279, 337 I.P.C., and Ex.P3 reveals the case of accident. Further on perusal of Ex.P4 it reveals that the offending vehicle was driven by the 1st respondent and the said vehicle is owned by the 2nd respondent. On further perusal it reveals that though R1 was in possession of driving licensing however badge was not obtained by him. Though the 3rd respondent would contend that R1 was not in possession of any badge except the bare statement found in the counter and Ex.P4 there is no evidence available to show that whether any action was initiated or any notice was issued to them in respect of the same. And no one was examined by R3 in this regard. 12.Further on perusal of Ex.P5 it reveals that the deceased was riding the two wheeler and the vehicle was in a good condition. Though in Ex.P5 it is stated that driving license was not produced at the time of inspection it is not the specific case of R3 that the deceased has not at all obtained any driving licence. Further in Ex.P4, P5 it has been categorically 7 mentioned that the accident was not caused due to any mechanical defects of the respective vehicles. 13.Further on perusal of Ex.P6 it reveals that though Ex.P2 F.I.R was registered as against the 1st respondent for the offence under 279 and 337 of I.P.C. Ex.P6 Final Report is laid against the 1st respondent for the offence under 304 (A) I.P.C. Further on perusal of Ex.P8 Post Mortem Certificate the doctor has opined that the deceased would appear to have died of head injury and it's complications and no other adverse remarks are mentioned in it. 14.Further on behalf of the petitioners one Vijayakumar was examined as P.W.2, who is the eye witness to the accident, who would depose that the offending vehicle driven by the 1st respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and the above said evidence was not shaken by the 3rd respondent. Though he was cross examined by R3. Further it is alse relevant to note that the 1st respondent who drove the offending vehicle remained ex-parte though summon was properly served upon him. 15.Further though the 3rd respondent would contend that it is the deceased who drove the vehicle without any license and dashed against the vehicle driven by the 1st respondent no material evidence is available as against the said contention of the 3rd respondent. Therefore contributory negligence cannot be attributed in the case in hand. 16.Therefore taking into consideration of the above said facts and circumstances of the case this Court is of the considered view that the petitioners have prima facie established that it is the 1st respondent who drove the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. Hence Point No. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent. POINT NO.2 : Who is liable to pay compensation? 17.It is admitted fact the 1st respondent is the driver of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the owner of offending vehicle and the 3rd respondent is the insurer of the offending vehicle. Further as Point No. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 8 POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioner? 18.The case of the petitioners is that at the time of accident the deceased was aged about 19 years and he was pursuing his B.S.C IInd Year Graduation at NIFS Coimbatore. Further they would contend that the petitioners are father and mother of the deceased and they have lost their only son who is the future. Further they would contend that the sufferings and sorrows mental agonies and hardships undergone by the petitioners cannot be compensated by any means or kind. However they should be compensated to the extent to which they are practically possible in the material world. Further the petitioners would contend that immediately after the accident the injured was taken to hospital and after one week he died without responding to the best treatment. IN support of their case they have also marked Ex.P7 medical bills, discharge summary. 19.On perusal of records it is admitted fact that the deceased is died due to road accident and Ex.P9 is the death certificate. Based on the death certificate Ex.P10 legal heir ship certificate was issued by the concerned authorities. In respect of the same there is no quarrel between the parties and hence this Court has no hesitation to hold that the petitioners alone are legal heirs and dependence of the deceased. 20.Now coming to the age and income of the deceased Dineshwaran it is admitted fact that the deceased was a student and pursuing his graduation and he was aged about 19 years. ON perusal of Ex.P11 birth certificate wherein it has stated that on 29-03-1995 the deceased was born. And Ex.P12, P13, P14 it reveals that the deceased was pursuing his B.Sc Graduation. 21.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or the dependents of the deceased. Normally the compensation should 9 commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 22.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may proceed to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 23.Therefore taking into consideration of the above the compensation has to be calculated based on the notional income of the deceased. 24.On perusal of Ex.P13 and Ex.P14 identity card of the deceased Dineshwaran which reveals that his date of birth is 29-03-1995 and he was pursuing his B.Sc Graduation in Fire and Industrial safety at Annamalai University. Hence as per the settled law notional income of the deceased is to be fixed depending upon the educational qualification of deceased in arriving the just conclusion of quantum of compensation to the petitioners. The age of the deceased is 19 years. 25.In support of the case of the petitioners they have also relied upon a judgment reported in …. 2017 (1) TNMAC … 220 .. in the case between Kandasamy and others …. Vs..... G. R. Sampath and others …. 26.Hence taking into consideration of the age of the deceased and the education qualification of the deceased a sum of Rs.8,000/-is fixed as notional income of the deceased. 27.As per the latest Judgment Reported in 2017 (2) TN MAC 609 (SC) in the case between National Insurance Company Limited … Vs..... Pranay Sethi and others 40% of the income is taken as addition. Hence 40% of the income comes to Rs.3,200/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.8,000+ Rs.3,200/- which is comes to 10 Rs.11,200/-. Hence s sum of Rs.11,200 /- is fixed as income of the deceased. 28.And as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 18 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court considering the marital status of the deceased 1/3 of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 29.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as the income of the deceased is Rs.11,200/-. Hence Rs.11,200 X 12 X 18 = Rs.24,19,200/- and 1/3rd personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.8,06,400/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs.24,19,200 – Rs.8,06,400 = Rs. 16,12,800/- 30. Further as per the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for funeral expenses, and a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for loss of estate, and based on Ex.P7 the medical bills the petitioners are also entitled for a sum, of Rs.51,426 (rounded off ) 31.Though the Ld. Counsel for the respondent would contend that though legal notice was issued to R1 and R2 directing them to produce the driving license of R1they failed to produce the same and hence they would contend that they are not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners and further they would contend that the deceased is also responsible for the accident and hence contributory negligence is to be attributed on the deceased. However the said contention of the R3 is not proved in the manner known to law. Hence the contention of the R3 cannot be countenanced with. 32.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.16,12,800/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/- 3 Funeral Expanes Rs. 15,000/- 4 Medical Bills Rs. 51,426 TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.16,94,226/- 11 From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.16,94,226 /-towards compensation and the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.16,94,226 /-with interest. In the result, the Respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.16,94,226/- with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. And out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.5,00,000/- of claim amount and the 2nd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.11,94,226/- of claim amount . After deposit, the petitioners are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount with interest immediately. The court fee of Rs.16,315/- is ordered to be paid by the Petitioners within one month. The Advocate fees is fixed at Rs.23,942/- to be paid by the respondents by a separate cheque.

POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle Hero Honda Pleasure bearing its Registration No. TN 38 BS 7938 on 30-08-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 4. If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 5.On behalf of the petitioner, the petitioner was examined as PW-1, and one Dinesh Kumar was examined as PW-2, and one Karthikeyan was examined as PW-3, and 17 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P17. On behalf of the defendants no witness has been examined and no documents were marked. On behalf of the witness 3 documents were marked as Ex.X1 to Ex.X3. 7 POINT No.1: Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle Hero Honda Pleasure bearing its Registration No. TN 38 BS 7938 on 30-08-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 6.The case of the petitioner is that on 30-08-2015 the deceased Selvaraj was riding in his two wheeler bearing registration No. TN 38 Y 3530 in the Coimbatore to Sakthi Main road. Further case of the petitioner is that on that day the deceased was proceeding to his company JEM Pattern Works and on the way when he turned to his right after proper indication and sound however all of a sudden the two wheeler bearing registration NO. TN 38 BS 7938 dashed against the deceased vehicle who came in a rash and negligent manner. Due to the said accident the deceased was thrown away on the road and sustained multiple injuries all over his body. Further case of the petitioners is that the 1st respondent is the driver cum owner of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the insurer of the offending vehicle. Hence as the accident had occurred due to the rash and negligent act of the 1st respondent both the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 7.Whereas the contention of the 2nd respondent is that the rider of the offending vehicle was not holding in a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the alleged accident. Hence there is a violation of the conditions of policy. Further they would contend that as the conditions in the policy is violated the insurance company is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 8.Further contentions of the 2nd respondent is that they denied the place, date, time and mode of the alleged accident. Further it is also equally false to allege that it is the first respondent who has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. As a matter of fact it is the deceased who was the root cause of the alleged accident since the accident took place in the middle of the road. 9.This Court as given its anxious consideration on the rival contentions of both the parties. On perusal of Ex.P1 F.I.R it reveals that a case is registered as against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s 279 and 304 (A) I.P.C. On perusal of Ex.P2 rough sketch the place of accident is shown. Further on perusal of Ex.P3 M.V . Report in respect of vehicle driven by the 1st respondent it reveals that the 1st respondent was in possession of a valid driving license and the said vehicle is insured under R2. Hence the contention of the 2nd respondent is that the driver of the offending 8 vehicle drove his vehicle without a valid driving licence false to the ground. Further on perusal of Ex.P4 it reveals that the concerned Police has laid his final report as against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s 279 and 304 (A) I.P.C. Further on perusal of Ex.P5 Post mortem certificate the Doctor has opined that the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries and no adverse remarks is mentioned against the deceased. Further the petitioners have also examined PW2 Dinesh Kumar who is the eye witness to the accident. In the chief examination he has categorically deposed that the 1st respondent has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the vehicle of the deceased. Though the PW-2 was elaborately cross examined nothing was able to extract in support of their contention. 10.Therefore taking into consideration of the available materials in hand this court is of the considered view that the petitioner have prima facie established that the 1st respondent alone has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident due to which the deceased died. Hence Point NO 1 is answered against the 1st respondent. POINT NO. 2: Who is liable to pay compensation? 11.Admittedly the 1st respondent is the driver -cum owner of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the insurer and as Point NO. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 12.The case of the petitioner is that the 1st petitioner is the wife of the deceased 2nd and 3rd petitioners are the daughters of the deceased and the 4th and 5th petitioners are the parents of the deceased Selvaraj. 13.Further case of the petitioners is that at the time of accident deceased Selvaraj was aged about 48 years, and he was hale ad healthy at the time of accident and he was working 9 in the Jem Patter works as a turner and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- per month and he also used to get a sum of Rs.5,000/- as extra wages by doing over time. Further case of the petitioners is that the deceased Selvaraj is the only bread winner of the family, and but for the accident he would have lived a long life. 14. Whereas the contention of the 2nd respondent is that it is false to allege that he was getting a sum of Rs.20,000/- p.m and the petitioners are depending upon the income of the deceased Selvaraj, The 2nd respondent would further contend that the claim amount is exorbitant and not sustainable in the eye of law. 15.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or the dependents of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 16.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may proceed to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 17.In order to prove that the deceased was employed and was considerably earning they examined P.W3 Karthiheyan who would depose that the deceased Selvaraj was working in his concern from 2013 onwards and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- of monthly remuneration. However during cross examination he has admitted that though he is running Sree Jem Pattern Works, no attendance register is maintained and his establishment is not registered under E.S.I. and P.F. Act. Further she has also admitted that no monthly salary is paid as such and depending upon 10 the duty the daily cooly is paid to the deceased and in respect of the same no document is maintained by him. On perusal of Ex.X2 it reveals that Srie Jem Works is registered under the Commercial Tax Department and Ex.X3 alleged salary certificate said to have issued by PW3 it is mentioned that the deceased was drawing a consolidated salary of Rs.15,000/- p.m. Further on perusal of Ex.P6 death certificate, It is admitted fact that deceased is died of road accident and Ex.P7 it reveals that the petitioners are the legal heirs of deceased Selvaraj, 18.On analyzing the materials in hand though P.W.3 would deposed that the deceased was employed at his establishment no material evidence is produced before this Court to prove the same. Though Ex.X2, X3 are marked the evidence of PW3 does not inspire the confidence of this Court. Hence considering the age of the deceased as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court Notional income of the deceased is taken into consideration to calculate the compensation. 19.As per the case of the petitioners the age of the deceased is 48 whereas in the post mortem certificate and in the death certificate the age of the deceased is mentioned as 51 Though the petitioners would alleged that deceased Selvaraj is aged about 48 no document evidence is produced to show that at the time of accident the deceased was aged about 48. Therefore the age of the deceased is fixed as 51 and a notional income of a sum of Rs.8,000/- is taken into consideration as monthly wages. And as per the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court a Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 11 and as there are 5 dependents 1/4th of the income of the deceased is deducted for his personal expenditure. 20.As per the latest Judgment Reported in 2017 (2) TN MAC 609 (SC) in the case between National Insurance Company Limited … Vs..... Pranay Sethi and others 10% of the income is taken as addition. Hence 10% of the income comes to Rs.800/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.8,000+ Rs.800/- which is comes to Rs.8,800/-. Hence s sum of Rs.8,800 /- is fixed as income of the deceased. 21.And as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 11 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court considering the marital status of the deceased 1/4 of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 11 22.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as the income of the deceased is Rs.8,800/-. Hence Rs.8,800 X 12 X 11 = Rs.11,61,600/- and 1/4th personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.2,90,400/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs. 11,61,600 – Rs.2,90,400 = Rs.8,71,200/- 23. Further as per the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for funeral expenses, and a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for loss of estate, and a sum of Rs.40,000/- was taken for loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner. 24.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.8,71,200/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/- 3 Funeral Expanes Rs. 15,000/- 4 Loss of consortium Rs. 40,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.9,41,200/- From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.19,41,200/- -towards compensation and the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.9,41,200/ -with interest . 25. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.6,41,200/-of claim amount, and the 2nd to 5th petitioners are entitled for each a sum of Rs.75,000/- of claim amount, Hence point Nos.3 & 4 are answered accordingly. In the result , the Respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.9,41,200/ - with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. And out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.6,41,200/- of claim amount and the 2nd to 5th Petitioners are entitled for each a sum of Rs.75,000/- of claim amount After deposit, all the petitioners are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount with 12 interest immediately.

But for the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent, the said accident certainly would not have happened. Hence the T/W (E) Police station has registered on FIR in crime No.297/2015 under section 279,337,304 (A) IPC against the 1st respondent and the same is pending before the judicial magistrate No.8 of Coimbatore. 7.Further case of the Petitioners is that the 1st respondent is the driver of the offending vehicle TNSTC bus bearing registration No.TN33N 1770 at the time of accident, the 2nd respondent is the owner of the said vehicle, since the above said offending bus owned by the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation hence it is exempted from being insured. 8.Further case of the Petitioners is that at the time of accident the deceased Nagaveni was hale and healthy aged about 30 years and doing business as a partner in the firm under the name of Style of Sri Vijayam Life Styles, Peelamedu, Coimbatore, thereby the deceased was earning monthly around Rs.25,000/- as salary besides a huge amount of profit as her share in the said partnership firm. Ever since the inception of the said business, it was growing bloomy fetching much profit due to hard effort, sincerity and dedication rendered by her towards her business.

Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or dependent of the deceased.

Hence as per the dictum of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the judgment reported in 2014 (I) TANMAC 451 (SCC) notional income of the deceased is to be taken into consideration.Hence having regard to the depsotition of PW-2 and further having regard to the fact that there is no contra evidence available to the claim of the Petitioners quantum of compensation is to be calculated. 9 19.Now coming to the quantum of compensation; Based on the docuemtns filed by the Petitioners the age of the deceased is fixed as 31; The notional income of the deceased is fixed as Rs.10,000/- pm; As the deceased is self employed considering the age loss of future prospects is 50% of the income; As per the law laid down by the Apex court in Sarala Varma case the Multiplier is 16 which is the proper multiplier for assessing the income of the deceased; Further as per the law laid down in Sarala Varma case 1/3rd of the income is to be deducted for personal expenses; 20.Notional income of the deceased is Rs.10,000/- and c oming to future prospects as the deceased was 31 years old 50% of the actual income is taken into consideration, hence 50% comes to Rs.5000/-. Hence, Rs.10000 + Rs.5000 comes to Rs.15,000/- Multiplier is 16, . 21.As such the loss of Income is calculated as follows; Rs.15,000 x 16 x12 = Rs.28,80,000/- and out of this 1/3rd of the amount is to be deducted for personal expenses of the deceased is comes to Rs.9,60,000/- and the Loss of Income of the deceased is comes to [Rs.28,80,000 - Rs.9,60,000/-] = Rs.19,20,000/- 10 22.The petitioners are entitled for the heads of compensation is as follows ; Sl.No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.19,20,000/- 2 Loss of Love & Affection (2nd minor petitioner ) Rs. 2,00,000/- 3 Loss of Consortium (1st Petitioner) Rs. 30,000/- 4 Funeral Expenses Rs. 20,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.21,70,000/- 23.

Hence as the 1st respondent is the driver of the offending bus bearing registration No.TN 33 N 1770 at the time of accident, the 2nd respondent is the owner of the said bus they are jointly ,severally and vicariously liable to pay the compensation to the petitioners. 12.As the Respondents remained absent and were ex-parte the available materials on hand are taken into consideration by this court to decide the claim of the Petitioners. Generally t he object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or dependent of the deceased. The compensation should commensurate to the loss of dependency suffered by the legal representatives. Therefore it should be just and reasonable, proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 7 13.In a given case, if the claim made is so exorbitant or if the claim made is contrary to ground realities, the Tribunal may not accept the claim and may proceed to determine the possible income by resorting to some guess work, which may include the ground realities prevailing at the relevant point of time. It depends on the facts of each case. 14.In support of theri claim the Petitioners have marked the following documents to prove the accdient and the negligence on the part of the 1st Respodnnet; (i)Ex.P12 is the driving license of the deceased and at the time of the accidnet she was in possesion of valid license; (ii)Ex.P1 is the FIR registered against the 1st Respodnent for the offence u/s.279, 304-A IPC; (iii)Ex.P2 is the rough sketch of the accident; (iv)Ex.P3 is the MV reprot of the two wheeler in which the deceased was riding; (v)Ex.P4 is the town bus involved in the accidnet; (vi)Ex.P5 is the final report laid as agasint the 1st Respondent; 15.Further in support of theri claim the Petitioners have marked the following documents to prove the death and the legal heirship and the minority of the 2nd Petitioner; (i)Ex.P6 is the Post Mortem reprot of the deceased.

During his chief examiantion he would categorically depsose that the town bus driven by the 1st Respodnent came in a rash and negligent manenr and dashed agasint the vehicle of the deceased and cuased her death. 18.Further though the Petitioners have marked certain docuemtns to show that she was a self employed person no income tax returns were submitted to show her montly income. Hence as per the dictum of the Hon'ble Apex Court in the judgment reported in 2014 (I) TANMAC 451 (SCC) notional income of the deceased is to be taken into consideration.Hence having regard to the depsotition of PW-2 and further having regard to the fact that there is no contra evidence available to the claim of the Petitioners quantum of compensation is to be calculated. 9 19.Now coming to the quantum of compensation; Based on the docuemtns filed by the Petitioners the age of the deceased is fixed as 31; The notional income of the deceased is fixed as Rs.10,000/- pm; As the deceased is self employed considering the age loss of future prospects is 50% of the income; As per the law laid down by the Apex court in Sarala Varma case the Multiplier is 16 which is the proper multiplier for assessing the income of the deceased; Further as per the law laid down in Sarala Varma case 1/3rd of the income is to be deducted for personal expenses; 20.Notional income of the deceased is Rs.10,000/- and c oming to future prospects as the deceased was 31 years old 50% of the actual income is taken into consideration, hence 50% comes to Rs.5000/-. Hence, Rs.10000 + Rs.5000 comes to Rs.15,000/- Multiplier is 16, . 21.As such the loss of Income is calculated as follows; Rs.15,000 x 16 x12 = Rs.28,80,000/- and out of this 1/3rd of the amount is to be deducted for personal expenses of the deceased is comes to Rs.9,60,000/- and the Loss of Income of the deceased is comes to [Rs.28,80,000 - Rs.9,60,000/-] = Rs.19,20,000/- 10 22.The petitioners are entitled for the heads of compensation is as follows ; Sl.No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.19,20,000/- 2 Loss of Love & Affection (2nd minor petitioner ) Rs. 2,00,000/- 3 Loss of Consortium (1st Petitioner) Rs. 30,000/- 4 Funeral Expenses Rs. 20,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.21,70,000/- 23. Hence, the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.21,70,000/- with interest to the Petitioners. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.6,70,000/- ; and the 2nd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.15,00,000/- . Hence points 1 to 4 are answered accordingly.

After that the body was handed over to the petitioners for performing last rites. iv)But for the rash and negligent driving of the bus bearing registration No. TN 37 BE 2112 by its driver the accident would not have taken place. The Perur police have registered a case in Crime No. 94/2013 under section 279, 304(A) IPC and arrested the driver of the said bus for causing the accident and are investigating upon. v)Before the accident the deceased Velusamy was working as a Turner at Meera Equipments, No. 4, Veerapandi pirivu, Coimbatore and was earning Rs.12,000/- per month and maintaining his family comfortably.

B. Road, R.S. Puram, Coimbatore. iv)The Police officials, without conducting a proper enquiry, have registered a case against the innocent respondent No. 1, who is the bus driver, even though there was no fault on his side. The 3rd respondent is under an obligation to indemnify the claim, which the 2nd respondent has been called upon to fulfill. The 3rd respondent is not under a lawful 4 obligation to fulfill the claim against the respondent No. 2. Hence the petition has to be dismissed. 4.A VERMENTS CONTAINED IN THE COUNTER STATEMENT FILED BY 3 rd RESPONDENT:- i)The claim made by the petitioners for a compensation of Rs.15,55,000/- but restricted to Rs.10,00,000/- on the allegation that on 20-04-2013 at about night 11 o' clock when the deceased S.

POINT No.1: - Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending private town bus bearing registration No. TN 37 BE 2112 (Route No. 35 C) on 20-04-2013 in a rash and negligent manner? 7.The case of the Petitioners is that on 20-04-2013 at about night 11 o' clock the said S. Velusamy was standing on the mud road in front of Padmavathy Hospital, Mathampatty. At that time all of a sudden a private town bus bearing registration No. TN 37 BE 2112 (Route No. 35 C) came from west to east direction on the Coimbatore to Siruvani main road in rash and negligent manner and dashed against the said S. Velusamy. Due to which the said 7 Velusamy fell down on the tarmac and sustained multiple grievous injuries and died on the spot. 8.Further case of the Petitioner is that immediately after the accident the same was intimated to the Perur Police and the body of S. Velusamy was sent to Coimbatore Medical College Hospital, Coimbatore. There the Post Mortem was conducted and the post mortem revealed the cause of accident. After that the body was handed over to the petitioners for performing last rites. 9.Further case of the Petitioner is that but for the rash and negligent driving of the bus bearing registration No. TN 37 BE 2112 by its driver the accident would not have taken place. The Perur police have registered a case in Crime No. 94/2013 under section 279, 304(A) IPC and arrested the driver of the said bus for causing the accident and are investigating upon. 10.Whereas the contention of the 1st Respondent is that the 2nd respondent is the owner of the bus and in no way connected with the accident that took place on 20-04-2013. The 1st respondent was driving the vehicle as per the traffic rules and regulations. The deceased due to his own negligence, met with the accident and the driver is in no way responsible for the accident. 11.Further contention of the 1st Respondent is that the driver has got a valid driving license and the vehicle has been insured with the 3rd respondent who has to indemnify the 2nd respondent in case of such accidents. The vehicle involved in the accident belongs to him and the same has been insured with the 3rd respondent under Policy No.7215001120100010745 with the Regional office, 1st floor, Obli Towers, 594, D. B. Road, R.S. Puram, Coimbatore. 12.Further contention of the 1st Respondent is that the Police officials, without conducting a proper enquiry, have registered a case against him who is innocent bus driver, even though there was no fault on his side. The 3rd respondent is under no obligation to 8 indemnify the claim, which the 2nd respondent has been called upon to fulfill. The 3rd respondent is under a lawful obligation to fulfill the claim against the respondent No. 2. 13.The contention of the 3rd Respondent is that the allegations contained in the petition are all false, frivolous and unsustainable both in Law and on facts. And hence the 3rd respondent does not admit any of the allegations made in the petition to be true, except those that are specifically admitted herein and put the petitioners to strict proof thereof. 14.The 3rd Respondent would further contend that if the driver of insured has violated any of the terms and conditions, restrictions and exclusions set out in the policy, or any of the provisions set out in the policy, or any of the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and any of the terms and conditions of the permit if any issued under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the 3rd respondent will be absolved from its liabilities. 15.The 3rd Respondent would further contend that the accident would not have happened, if the deceased S. Velusamy took a little of care, while standing on the Coimbatore – Siruvani Road, which is always very busy with traffic. At night hours vehicles ply with lights on instead of giving way to the vehicle coming on the main Road, the deceased S. Velusamy negligently continued to stand on the Road and involved in the accident, due to his careless and negligent, the accident would happened. The contribution to the accident by the deceased S. Velusamy is 100%. 16.This court has given its anxious consideration on the rival contentions of both the parties. On perusal of Ex.P1 FIR it reveals that on 21.04.2013 a complaint was lodged and a case was registered as against the 1st Respondent for the offence u/s.279 and 304(A) IPC. Further on perusal of Ex.P4 it reveals that as against the driver the 1st Respondent herein the final report was laid for the offences u/s.279 and 304(A) IPC. Even in Ex.P2 the MV report it is mentioned that the 1st Respondent is the driver of the offending vehicle and the 2nd Respondent is the owner of the offending vehicle. Ex.P3 is the rough sketch showing the accident. 9 17.Further the petitioner also examined PW2 who is the eye witness to the accident. On perusal of deposition of PW2 it reveals that the deceased was standing the mud road besides the Thaar road and the private bus bearing registration No. TN 37 BE 2112 came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. Though he was elaborately cross examined by R3 nothing was contradicted by them. Further on perusal of the materials in hand it reveals that though the accident had occurred on 20-04-2013 the F.I.R was lodged after three months. The reason assigned by the petitioners is that the lodged missing complaint that the deceased was missing and hence they were not aware of accident and the death of the deceased. Due to which the delay happened. Even on perusal of Ex.P1 F.I.R it reveals that the watchman of Padmavathi Hospital as given by the complaint stating that some unknown person was hit by the bus driven by the 1st respondent. Further admittedly driven by the 1st respondent and R2 is the owner of the said bus. There is no categorical denial of the accident occurred on 20-04-2013 rather the defence of R1 is that there is no negligence on his part it is only due to the negligence of the deceased the accident had occurred. However the F.I.R. and the evidence of PW2 reveals that it is the 1st respondent who came in a rash and negligent manner and hit the deceased who was standing in the mud road. And after hit he attempted to go away from the SOC. Further after due investigation the concerned Police has filed Ex.P4 Final Report as against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s 279 and 304 (A) IPC. 18.Therefore taking into consideration of the available materials in hand this Court is of the considered view that the petitioners have prima facie established that the 1st respondent alone has driven the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased due to which he died. Hence Point No. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent. POINT NO.2:- Who is liable to pay compensation ? 19.As point No.1 is answered against the 1st Respondent he as the driver of the offending vehicle, the 2nd Respondent the owner of the vehicle and the 3rd Respondent the insurer are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the Petitioners. Hence point No.2 is answered accordingly. 10 POINT NO.3 & 4: Whether the petitioner is entitled for compensation ? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioner? 20.The case of the petitioners is that they are the legal heirs of the deceased S. Velusamy who died in a motor vehicle accident that took place on 20-04-2013 involving a bus bearing Registration No. TN 37 BE 2112. 21.Further case of the Petitioners is that before the accident the deceased Velusamy was working as a Turner at Miraa Equipments, No. 4, Veerapandi pirivu, Coimbatore and was earning Rs.12,000/- per month and maintaining his family comfortably. At the time of accident, the deceased was aged about 50 years and was hale and healthy. Due to the unexpected sudden death of Velusamy the petitioners are terribly shocked and their day to day life structure itself is paralyzed. But for the accident he would have lived for another 30 years. The 1st petitioner is son, the 2nd and 3rd petitioners are parents and the 4th petitioner is 2nd wife of the deceased. The petitioners are yet to relieve from the shock. The 2nd and 3rd petitioners are aged parents living with their only son and they are also terribly affected in all aspects and at their old age they are unable to work and live and their position is at very much risk. The 4th petitioner is the 2nd wife of deceased Velusamy who married her after the death of the 1st wife namely Kanchanamani. Except the petitioners no other legal heirs to claim compensation. 22.Further case of the Petitioners is that the sufferings and sorrows and mental agonies and hardships that are undergone by the petitioners cannot be compensated by any means of kinds, of course they are incapable of more monetary measures of calculations. However they should be compensated to the extent to which they are practically possible in this material world. 23.Whereas the contention of the 1st Respondent is that even though there was no fault on his side the 3rd respondent is under an obligation to indemnify the claim, which the 2nd respondent has been called upon to fulfill. Hence he would contend that the 3rd respondent 11 is under a lawful obligation to fulfill the claim against the respondent No. 2. 24.However the 3rd respondent would contend that the petitioners are put to strict proof that deceased S. Velusamy was aged about 50 years only and was working as a Turner in Miraa Equipments, and was earning a sum of Rs.12,000/- per month. The petitioners are bound to examine any Officer of the employer viz., Miraa Equipments, Coimbatore, to prove the employment, the attendance, the Salary Register of the employees of the cadre of the deceased S. Velusamy. 25.Further contention of the 3rd Respondent is that petitioners are put to strict proof that they are the only legal representatives of the deceased S. Velusamy and are depending on the deceased. 26.This Court has given it's anxious consideration on the contention raised by both the parties in this aspect. It is settled principle of Law that while awarding compensation it should be bare in mind that the object of providing compensation is to litigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monitary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or the dependence of deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate with the loss suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 27.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of round realities the Tribunal may not accept the case and may proceed to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting to some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Therefore from the available materials in hand it is to be seen what is the quantum of amount the petitioners are entitled for. 28.Now coming to the age of the deceased it was seriously objected by the respondents 12 that the person who met with the accident occurred on 20-04-2013 it is not the father of the petitioner since according to the petitioner the age of his father is 50 years and was hale and healthy. However in the F.IR. Ex.P1 it is mentioned as unknown person aged about 38 years. 29.Though the objection raised by the 3rd respondent has some force however on perusal of Ex.P7 which is submitted by Perur Police Station wherein it is stated that after investigation they came to note that the person met to the accident on 20-04-2013 is Velusamy aged about 50 years and Ex.P6 is also submitted by the concerned Police to the Ld. J.M. I, Coimbatore and on perusal of Ex.P7 the death certificate of Velusamy his age is mentioned as 50. 30.Even RW1 examined by the respondent also deposed that …... @ehd; jw;bghGJ ngU:u; fhty; epiyaj;jpy; Ma;thsuhf gzp g[upfpnwd;/ ,e;j tHf;F tpgj;J rkaj;jpy; ehd; Cl;oapy; gzp g[upe;njd;/ tHf;F Mtz';fspd; mog;gilapy; ehd; jw;bghGJ rhl;rpak; mspf;fpnwd;/ ,e;j tHf;F tpgu';fs; vdf;F neuoahf bjupahJ/ k/rh/M/1 Kjy; jfty; mwpf;ifapy; ahu; ,we;jhu; vd;W Fwpg;gpltpy;iy vd;W brhd;dhy; ,we;j egupd; bgau; tpyhrk; bjupatpy;iy vd;W Fwpg;gplg;gl;Ls;sJ/ ,we;J nghd egu; bgau; tpyhrk; g[yd; tprhuizapy; bjupa te;jjhf Mtz';fspy; Fwpg;gplg;gl;Ls;sJ/ eh';fs; jhf;fy; bra;j Fw;w ,Wjp mwpf;ifapy; ,we;J nghd egu; ntYrhkp vd;W kl;Lk; jhd; eh';fs; Fwpg;gpl;Ls;nshk; vd;Wk; mtuJ tpgu';fs; v';fSf;F vg;bghGJ bjupa te;jJ vd;w tpgu';fs; Fwpg;gpltpy;iy vd;W brhd;dhy; rup jhd;/ ,e;j tHf;fpy; Fwpg;gplg;gl;Ls;s tpgj;jpdhy; jhd; ntYr;rhkp ,we;J tpl;lhu; vd;W v';fshy; cWjpahf Tw KoahJ vd;W brhd;dhy; rk;gt ,lj;jpy; ,Ue;J vLf;fg;gl;l ifnuif kw;Wk; ifnuif ep[g[zu;fs; bfhLj;j mwpf;if kw;Wk; ntYr;rhkp fhzhky; ngha; tpl;lhu; vd;W bfhLj;j g[fhu; ,e;j K:d;iwa[k; itj;J jhd; ,we;J nghdJ ntYr;rhkp vd;W eh';fs; Kot[ bra;njhk;@/ 31.Further on perusal of Ex.P9 the death certificate of the mother of the 1st petitioner namely Kanjanamani died on 30-06-2005 and Ex.P10 legal heir certificate dated 28-07- 2005 the deceased Velusamy is shown as the husband of Kanjanamani aged about 47 and he 13 and the 1st petitioner herein of shown as the legal heirs of said Kanjanamani. 32.Further on perusal of Ex.P11 the E.S.I. Identity card issued to the deceased the date of birth of the deceased is shown as 04-05-1963. Even in Ex.P12 the date of birth of deceased Velusamy is shown as 04-05-1963. Therefore taking into consideration of the available materials in hand and having regard to the E.S.I. Identvity Card issued by the employer of the deceased the age of the deceased is fixed as 50. 33.On perusal of Ex.P8 it appears that all the petitioners are the legal heirs of the deceased Velusamy. Hene all the petitioners are entitled for compensation. 34.Now coming to the loss of income of the deceased the case of the petitioner is that the deceased was working as a turnor at Miraa Equiptment situated at No. 4 Veerapandi pirivu, Coimbatore and was earning a sum of Rs.12,000/- per month and maintaining his family comfortably. 35.In support of the same they also examined the employer of deceased Veerasamy on summons issued by this Court the Manager of Miraa Equipments appeared before this Court and deposed that, “ ,we;J nghd ntYrhkp v';fs; epWtdj;jpy; lu;dhf ntiy ghu;j;jhu; vd;W fhl;Ltjw;F Mjhukhf Vg;uy; 2012ypUe;J khu;r; 2013 fhyfl;lj;jpw;fhd v';fs; epWtdj;jpd; tUif gjpntl;od; g[ifg;gl efy; mry;fs; xg;gpl;L ghu;j;J k/rh/24 Mf FwpaPL bra;ag;gLfpwJ/ v';fs; epWtdk; bjhHpyhsu; ey fhg;gPl;L fHfj;jpy; gjpt[ bra;ag;gl;l epWtdkhFk;/ mjdhy; tHf;fpy; ,we;J nghd ntYrhkpf;F eh';fs; ,/v!;/ I/ re;jh fl;oa[s;nshk;/ mjw;F Mjhukhf mtuJ milahs ml;ilapd; g[fig;gl efy; k/rh/M/25 Mf FwpaPL bra;ag;gLfpwJ/ nkYk; v';fs; epWtdk; bjhHpyhsu; nrk ey epjp rl;lj;jpYk; gjpt[ bra;ag;gl;Ls;sJ/ 2015 ? 2016 Mz;L fhyj;jpw;F eh';fs; brYj;jpa re;jh bjhif tpguj;ij v';fSf;F mspj;j urPJ k/rh/M/26Mf FwpaPL bra;ag;gKLpfwJ/ ntYrhkpapd; mf;nlhgu; 2012 Kjy; khu;r; 2013 tiuapyhd fhyj;jpw;fhd rk;gs tpguj;jpd; g[ifg;gl efy; mrYld; xg;gpl;L ghu;f;fg;gl;L k/rh/M/27 Mf FwpaPL bra;ag;gLfpwJ/@ 36.Further on perusal of Ex.P27 it reveals that depending upon the number of working 14 days the deceased getting salary of a sum of Rs. 4962/- to 6930/- . Therefore taking into consideration of the salary received by the deceased for the month of February 2013 (for 22 working days) the monthly salary of the deceased is fixed as Rs.6,000/-. 37.As the age of the deceased is fixed as 50 years. As per the latest Judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Special Leave Petition (Civil No. 25590/14 ) in the case between National Insurance Company Vs Pranay Sethi and others 30% of the income is taken as addition. Hence 30% of the income comes to Rs.1,800/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.6000+ Rs.1,800/- which is comes to Rs.7,800/-. 38.Further as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Sharla Varma case the relevant multiplier is 13 and as per the Law laid down in the same judgment and taking into consideration of the fact that as there are four claimants in the family of the deceased ¼ of the income of the deceased is taken for the personal expenditure of the deceased. 39.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as th income of the deceased is Rs.7,800/-. Hence Rs.7,800 X 12 X 13 = Rs.12,16,800/- and 1/4th personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.3,04,200/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs.12,16,800 – 3,04,200 = Rs.9,12,600/-. 40.As per the latest Judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court for loss of estate the petitioners are entitled for a sum of Rs.15,000/- and the 4th petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.40,000/- by way of consortium and all the petitioners for a sum of Rs.15,000/- for funeral expenses. 41.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.9,12,600/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs.15,000/- 3 Loss of consortium Rs.40,000/- 4 Funeral Expenses Rs.15,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.9,82,600/- 15 From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs. 9,82,600/-towards compensation and the Respondents 1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs. 9,82,600/-with interest. Hence, the Point No.3 & 4 are answered accordingly. In the result, the Respondents 1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs. Rs. 9,82,600/- with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months.

No. 654/15 1. K.S.Arukutti 2. Tmt.K.Lakshmi ... Petitioners / Vs/ 1. K.Arumugam 2. Rajam Transports 3. The New India Assurance Company Limited, Coimbatore. ... Respondent s This petition coming on 22-06-2018 for final hearing before me in the presence of Thiru.S.Deepakumar, B.Com., B.L., Advocate for the Petitioners and of Thiru.T.Mehanatha Sundarasamy, Advocate for the 3rd respondent, and the 1st and 2nd respondents are called absent set ex-parte, and upon hearing the arguments and perusing the evidences oral and documentary on record and having stood over till this day for consideration, this court passed the following: REVIEW AWARD This petition is filed by the petitioner u/s.166(1)(a) of Motor Vehicles Act Seeking compensation for a sum of Rs.50,00,000/- with subsequent interest thereon to the petitioners; AND awarding cost of the petition. 2. The averments in the petition in brief are as follows : i) This is a case of death A.Sureshkumar due to motor vehicle accident took place on 30.01.2015 at about morning 08.00 am. The petitioners herein are the parents of the deceased A.Sureshkumar, preferring the claim petition for claiming compensation, as his legal representatives. ii) The accidental day of 30.01.2015 at about morning 08.00 am, the deceased riding the 2 Splendor Plus Motor cycle bearing Regn.No.TN40-X-1275 on the Kovai to Annur Road, near the Sanjive Hospital from South to North direction in carefully and cautiously. At the same time, the Rajam Private Bus bearing Regn.No.TN-36-X-5577 in a rash and negligent manner without giving the Sound of Horn, coming from Annur to Kovai direction to overtake the Lorry towards North to South direction and dashed against the deceased's vehicle, the deceased sustained severe injuries with bloodshed on his Head, legs and multiple injuries all over his body and was fainted. Immediately, after the accident, the deceased was given first aid treatment at Annur Government Hospital and later transported to KMCH Hospital, Coimbatore he is died on the same day. The 1st respondent herein have failed to exercise due care, caution over his steering the Bus and not even followed the basic traffic rules and regulations of which was the main reason for this occurred accident and the death of the deceased too. iii) The petitioners have lost their beloved son at the prime of his youth and the parents were piling hope against hope for their future and all their hopes have been shattered to pieces. The accident has left a great vacuum in their life and they have to spend the rest of their life in mental agony and torture. Their future has been doomed and they will be helpless in their old age. iv) At the time of accident, the deceased A.Sureshkumar was aged about 24 years, hale and healthy and was working as Accounts Assistant in Raj Television and was earning Rs.22,000/- per month. But due to sudden demise of the deceased A.Sureshkumar, the petitioners herein are terribly shocked and their day-to-day life structure is itself paralyzed. The petitioners have lost their beloved son for their livelihood, when alive, the deceased was only the earning member and supporting pillar of the family and subscribed his earnings, only to the welfare of the petitioners. The petitioner is depending on the income of the deceased. If the said A.Sureshkumar could not met with the accident and died in the same, he would have been lived for another 50 years healthily and would have taken care of the petitioners. Due to unexpected demise, the entire expectation and dependency of the petitioners has been ruined. The petitioners herein are mainly depending on this compensation amount. v) But for the rash and negligence of driver of Rajam Private Bus bearing Regn.No.TN-36-X-5577, the accident would not have taken place. Annur Police have registered the case in FIR No.57/2015 U/s.279, 338, 304(A) of IPC and prosecuted against him for causing the accident and also the death and the same is pending for trial, before the Hon'ble Judicial Magistrate Court, Mettupalayam. vi) The driver of Rajam Private Bus bearing Regn.No.TN-36-X-5577 is the 1st respondent herein, whereas the 2nd and 3rd respondents are its owner and insurer respectively. Therefore, all the three respondents are jointly, severally and vicariously liable to pay the compensation to the 3 petitioner herein. vii) The sufferings and sorrows and mental agonies and hardships that are undergone by the petitioner cannot be compensated by any means of kinds; of course they are incapable of mere monetary measures of calculations. However, they should be compensated to the extent to which they are practically possible in this material world. Hence, this petition. 3. The averments in counter statement of 3 rd respondent are as follows :- i) The petitioners have not chosen to file all the relevant documents relating to the vehicle, accident and the status of the deceased. The petitioners have not filed the relevant documents relating to their claim along with their petition. ii) The respondents 1 & 2 who are the driver and owner of the private bus TN-36-X-5577 have failed to inform the alleged accident to this respondent as required under the terms and conditions of policy. The respondent has reasons and grounds to believe that the respondents 1 & 2 are colluding with the petitioners for unlawful gain. Hence, the respondent being the insurer of the private bus craves leave of this court to permit the respondent to take all the defenses of the driver and owner of the insured vehicle also U/s.170 of the Motor Vehicles Act in case the respondents 1 & 2 remain ex-parte or fail to contest the claim effectively or collude with the petitioners. The private bus TN-36-X-5577 was insured with the respondent in the name of the 2nd respondent on the date of the alleged accident. The terms and conditions of policy with regard to the limits and limitations of liability of the respondent may be read as part and parcel of this counter. In case of violation of any of the terms and conditions of policy, the respondent is not liable to indemnify the insured. iii) There was absolutely no rashness or negligence on the part of the 1st respondent in driving the bus TN-36-X-5577 on the date of the alleged accident. The petitioners are strictly bound to prove that the alleged accident occurred solely due to the rash and negligent driving of the bus TN-36-X-5577 by the 1st respondent. The deceased Sureshkumar had suddenly abruptly and recklessly crossed the road in his motor cycle from west to east and invited the accident by himself. iv) The place of accident and the manner of the accident would clearly go to show that the 1st respondent alone cannot be blamed for causing the accident. The deceased who was the rider of the motor cycle TN-40-X-1275 had suddenly crossed the road and had substantially contributed to the unfortunate accident. But for the sudden and reckless crossing of the road by the deceased in his motor cycle, the accident would not have occurred. v) The petitioners are strictly bound to prove the age, employment and income of the deceased by documentary evidence. The deceased had no regular source of income and the 4 deceased was not working as Account Assistant with Raj Television Networks Ltd., Bangalore on the date of the accident. He had already resigned the job. The petitioners have computed and claimed the compensation amount based on assumptions and presumptions. The claim of compensation amount cannot be bonanza or a windfall or a source of profit. The petitioners are attempting to make a fortune out of an unfortunate accident. The quantum of negligence contributed by the deceased A.Sureshkumar to the accident has to be reckoned while assessing the compensation and prays to dismiss the claim. 4. The points for consideration are :- 1.Whether the 1st respondent has drove the Bus bearing its Registration No. TN-38-X-5577 on 30-01-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Whether the respondents are liable to pay the compensation ? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the just compensation ? 5.On behalf of the petitioner, the 1st petitioner was examined as PW-1, one Siva Shanmugam examined as P.W.2 and one N.Raveendran as P.W.3 and documents from Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.22 were marked. Ex.R.1 has been marked during cross examination of P.W.1. Ex.X.1 to Ex.X4 have been marked through the witness P.W.2. There is no oral evidence was let on behalf of the respondents. 6. Point Nos.1 to 3 : - The case of the 1st petitioner is that the deceased A.Sureshkumar is Son of the petitioners who was riding the Splendor Plus Motor Cycle bearing Regn.No.TN 40X-1275 on the Kovai to Annur Road, near the Sanjive Hospital from South to North direction on 30.01.2015. 7. The further case of the petitioner is that on 30.01.2015 at about 8.00 am, when the deceased Sureshkumar was riding the Splendor Plus Motor Cycle bearing Regn.No.TN 40X-1275 on the Kovai to Annur Road, near the Sanjive Hospital from South to North, the Rajam Private Bus bus belonging to the 2nd respondent bearing Regn.No.TN-36-X-5577 driven by the 1st respondent in a rash and negligent manner from Annur to Kovai direction to overtake the Lorry towards North to South direction and dashed against the two wheeler which the deceased Sureshkumar was riding, as a result of which, the deceased sustained injuries with bloodshed on his head, legs and multiple injuries all over his body and was fainted and immediately the said Sureshkumar was given first aid treatment at Annur Government Hospital and later transported to KMCH Hospital, Coimbatore when he succumbed to the injuries and died. 5 8. There is no dispute in Ex.P.1 FIR and Ex.P.4, the rough sketch. In Ex.P.1, the deceased has been stated to have driven the vehicle namely Splendor Plus Motor Cycle bearing Regn.No.TN 40X-1275 in the opposite direction to the bus bearing Regn.No.TN-36-X-5577 belonging to the 2nd respondent and driven by the 1st respondent from Annur towards Coimbatore. Similarly, Ex.P.4 reveals that the accident has happened in the western half of the North to South running road. On behalf of the petitioners, the eye witness to the accident was examined as PW-2 who would depose that it is the 1st respondent who drove the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the Motor Cycle in which the deceased was riding . When P.W.2 has stated that the deceased was riding the two wheeler from South to North direction, the bus was coming from North to South direction and the accident occurred due to head on collision between the two vehicles and when Ex.P.4 has not been disputed, then, which ipsofacto proves the rash and negligent manner in which the bus has been driving by the 1st respondent. It is clear from the evidence of P.W.2 that though Kovai to Annur road was full of traffic, the 1st respondent drive the bus without even making the horn, overtaking a lorry, then, the manner of the accident and its caused remains sufficiently proved. In other words, the evidence of P.W.2 together with Ex.P.1 & Ex.P.4 prove that the bus has been driven in a rash and negligent manner, overtaking a heavy vehicle like lorry which was plying from North to South colliding with the two wheeler which was driven by the deceased. There is no suggestion made to P.W.2 that the deceased could have avoided the accident intelligently. While so, it is clear that inspite of deligence, the accident could not have been averted by the deceased riding the two wheeler. When P.W.2 is a complainant in Ex.P.1, the FIR and when there is no delay in lodging the complaint, then, there is no reason to discard his evidence as unreliable. On the other hand, P.W.2's evidence being in consonance with the FIR Ex.P.1, registered within one hour from the time of accident, is found to be reliable. 9. There is no dispute as to the relationship of the petitioners to the deceased Sureshkumar. According to the petitioners, the said Sureshkumar was aged about 24 years, hale and healthy and was working as Accounts Assistant in Raj Television and was earning Rs.22,000/- per month. There is no dispute as to the age of the deceased Sureshkumar which is revealed from Ex.P18, the copy of driving licence of the deceased to be 13.09.1989 which comes the age of the victim to be 25 years and 3 months. As such, he would have normally lived atleast for another 35 years and due to her sudden death, the petitioners has lost their son and his moral support. There is no dispute with respect to the death of the victim on 30.01.2015, which is also supported by Ex.P.2, the death certificate & Ex.P.8, the Post Mortem Certificate. Similarly, the petitioners being the legal heirs of deceased Sureshkumar, which is also not disputed and supported by Ex.P.13, the legal heirship 6 certificate of the deceased. Ex.P.8, the postmortem report reveals that the deceased died due to multiple injuries and its complications which is proved to have caused due to the accident occurred on 30.01.2015, for which the 1st & 2nd respondents being the driver and the owner of the bus are jointly and severally liable. 10. Now, coming to the claim of compensation, according to the petitioners, they have claimed a loss to the extent of Rs.50 lakhs as per the petition. It is true that the evidence of P.W.3 Mr.Ravindran, HR-Administration in Raj Television Network has deposed that the deceased Sureshkumar was working in their concern as Accounts Assistant from 01.06.2013 to 31.12.2014 and he has resigned his job by submitting a resignation letter and he has been relieved from the job on 31.12.2014 and that the deceased was not working in Raj Television Network on 30.01.2015, the date of accident. However, it should be borne in mind that it is hardly a month from the date of his resignation till the death of the deceased Sureshkumar. Ex.P.10 reveals that during December 2014, he has received a Net Salary of Rs.23,294/-. Though it is stated that the deceased was not working on the date of accident, Ex.P.16 & Ex.P.17, the copies of Degree Certificates of the deceased would show that he is a B.Sc., M.B.A Graduate and is capable of getting a good job. When it is not the case of either parties that the deceased was expelled from the job on any adverse findings or remarks and when according to P.W.3, it was based upon the voluntary resignation of the deceased, then, it can be presumed that the deceased resigned his job only to search for a lucrative job or a job which would fetch an income more than what he was earning earlier. 11. It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be borne in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus, the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or the dependents of the deceased. Normally, the compensation should commensurate to the loss of dependence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 12. In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may proceed to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 13. In the circumstances of the case and considering the educational qualification and the age (25 years) of the deceased Sureshkumar and having a precedence, this court finds it just to fix 7 the income of the deceased at Rs.15,000/- per month and the appropriate multiplier to be 18. 14. As per the latest judgment reported in 2017 (2) TN MAC 609(SC) in the case between National Insurance Company Limited Vs Pranay Sethi and others , 40% of the income is taken as addition. Hence, 40% of the Annual income comes to Rs.72,000/- and the total loss of Annual income is calculated as Rs.1,80,000/- + Rs.72,000/- which is comes to Rs.2,52,000/-. 15. As per the law laid down in Sarla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 18 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court considering the bachelor status of the deceased, 50% of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 16. Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as the income of the deceased is Rs.2,52,000/-. Hence, Rs.2,52,000/- x 18 = Rs.45,36,000/- and 50% personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.22,68,000/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs.45,36,000 – Rs.22,68,000/- = Rs.22,68,000/-. 17. Further as per the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for funeral expenses, and a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for loss of estate. 18. Hence, in total the loss of income is calculated as follows : Sl.No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.22,68,000/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/- 3 Funeral Expenses Rs. 15,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.22,98,000/- 19. From the foregoing, this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled to a total sum of Rs.22,98,000/- towards compensation and the respondents 1,2 & 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.22,98,000/- with interest. 20. When the insurance of the bus bearing Regn.No.TN-36-X-5577 is valid and in vogue and when the deceased was holding a valid licence and when it has been established on the side of the petitioner that it was the 1st respondent who drove the above said bus belonging to the 2nd respondent had been the reason for the accident, then, the 3rd respondent who is the insurer is liable to pay the compensation amount as arrived in the earlier paragraphs. 8 21. In the result, the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.22,98,000/- with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of the petition (I.e) 18.06.2015 till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. And out of the said sum, both the p etitioners are entitled to equal share in the claim amount. After deposit, the petitioners are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount with interest immediately. The court fee of Rs.27,212/- is paid by the petitioners and the excess court fee of Rs.4859/- (Rs.27,212.00 - Rs.22,353.00) is ordered to be paid to the Petitioners.

DISTRICT COURT, COIMBATORE Present: Tmt.J.Sridevi, B.Sc., M.L., IV Addl District and Sessions Judge, Coimbatore Thursday the 19 th day of July 2018 [Thiruvalluvar Andu 2049 Sree Vilambi Varudam Aadi Thingal 03 rd day] M.C.O.P. No. 396 of 2015 1. Tmt.B.Sivasakthi 2. S.Ramachandran 3. M.Angu ... Petitioners .Vs. 1. J.Pradeep 2. S.Sekar 3. The Oriental Insurance Company Ltd ... Respondents This petition coming on 06.07.2018 for final hearing before me with Thiru.A.K.Rahman, M.A., B.L., Advocate appearing for the petitioners, 1st and 2nd respondent remained Exparte and Thiru.T.Mehanatha Sundarasamy, B.Sc., B.L., Advocate appearing for the 3rd respondent and upon hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the evidences, oral and documentary, on record and having stood over till this day for consideration, this court passed the following: AWARD 1. This petition has been filed under Section 166 (1) (c) of Motor Vehicle Act seeking compensation of Rs.20,00,000/­ with subsequent interest and costs. 2. The claim of the petitioners that, the deceased R,Nagendran was riding his Unicorn Motor Cycle bearing its Regn.No.TN 38 BU 9149 from MCOP . No. 396 of 2015 2 South to North direction on the Coimbatore to Mettupalayam road along with his friend Saravanan. It was 10.30 am on 15.08.2015 the said motor cycle was nearing Thoppampatty Pirivu, opposite to Venkateswara Mahal on the above said road and there were vehicles plying up and down. The said Nagendran following a vehicle and the said vehicle over took on going Tractor. Unfortunately, the on going Tractor which was using for pouring to the road median plants suddenly stopped the vehicle without any signal. Due to the sudden act of the tractor driver the said Nagendran could not able to control his vehicle and hit on the rear side of the Tractor and sustained severe head injuries and after treatment from Coimbatore Medical College Hospital, he was succumbed to his injuries on the same day at about 12 pm. Claiming that, the deceased R.Nagendran was 29 years at the time of his death and that the above said petitioners are dependants on him, have come up with the present petition seeking compensation, contending that it was the negligent driving of the 1st respondent, the accident happened and that they are liable to pay compensation to them. 3. The 1st & 2nd respondents remained Exparte. The 3rd respondent filed a counter statement and contended that the tractor bearing Regn.No.TN 58Q 1909 alone was insured with the respondent in the name of 2nd respondent and the tanker was not insured and that the deceased Nagendran had driven his Motor Cycle TN 38 BU 9149 in a rash and negligent manner and at an uncontrollable speed from South to North along the Coimbatore – Mettupalayam road and had himself dashed against the rear left portion of the parked tanker attached to the Tractor and thereby the accident occurred and that the deceased had driven his Motor Cycle in broad day light without following the traffic rules and regulations and had himself invited the accident by dashing against the rear left portion of the parked tanker attached to the tractor and that the Pillion rider of the Motor Cycle bearing Regn.No.TN 38 BU 9149 G.Saravanakumar has also filed a claim petition in MCOP 1809 of 2015 on the file of the Special Subordinate Judge MCOP . No. 396 of 2015 3 for MCOP cases of Coimbatore claiming compensation for the injuries sustained by him in the very same accident and that the 1st & 2nd respondents alone liable to answer the claim of the petitioners. 4. The points that arise for consideration are i) Whether the petition mentioned accident occurred due to the 1st respondent's negligent driving of the Tractor bearing Reg. No. TN 58 Q 1909 ? ii) Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation? iii) If so, what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners ? 5. In support of the petitioners' contentions, 3rd petitioner has examined herself as PW1, one Anguraj as PW2 and one A.R.Parthiban as PW3. Ex.P1 to Ex.P.17 have been marked on the side of the petitioner. Ex.X1 to Ex.X5 have been marked through the witness. In support of the 3rd respondent's contentions, the 3rd respondent has examined one Ramesh as R.W.1, one Shanmugasundaram as R.W.2 and G.Shanthi as R.W.3. Ex.R.1 to Ex.R.6 have been marked on the side of the 3rd respondent. Ex.X1 has been marked through the witness. 6. Heard both. Perused the materials on record. The claim of the petitioners that the 1st respondent's negligent driving had caused the accident. This has been supported by the evidence of PW2, who had stated that he saw the accident who was riding his motor cycle towards south to north direction on the same day. Nothing has been elicited during the cross examination of P.W.1, warranting any doubt about the veracity of his evidence. 7. Per contra, the rival contention of the 3rd respondent is that the deceased was responsible for the accident as he had driven his motor cycle MCOP . No. 396 of 2015 4 bearing Regn.No.TN 38 BU 9149 in a rash and negligent manner and at an uncontrollable speed from South to North along the Coimbatore to Mettupalayam road and himself dashed against the rear left portion of the parked tanker attached to the tractor and it is further contended that there was absolutely no rashness and recklessness or negligence on the part of the 1st respondent in driving the tractor bearing Regn.No.TN 58Q 1909 on the date of the alleged accident. It is true that Assistant Manager of the 3rd respondent while deposing as R.W.1 has stated akin to the allegation put forth by the 3rd respondent through its pleadings. However, this court does not see any basis for such allegation and the allegation that a false complaint has been filed against the 1st respondent. In other words, when the police complaint has been lodged against the 1st respondent and the FIR, Ex.P.1 has been registered based upon such complaint, which has fructified into charge sheet Ex.P.9, wherein the 1st respondent is shown to be the accused being the driver of the tractor bearing Regn.No. TN 58Q 1909, the criminal case cannot be said to be falsely implicating the 1st respondent. Further more, Ex.P.3, the rough sketch would indicate the direction and also the place of occurrence. Ex.P.3 confirms that it is two lane road. Further, P.W.2 Ankuraj has deposed to have witnessed the accident and he further deposed that வவபதததவலத ஈடபடதட டரரகதடரத ஆனத அநதத சரலலயவனத லமய தடபதப சவறதறவலத உளதள சசடகளகதக தணதணணரத ஊறதறவகத சகரணதட இரநததத எனதற சசரனதனரலத சரவதரனத . இநதத வவபதததவலத இறநதத பபரன நரபகநததவரனத ஓடதடசத சசனதற இர சகதகர வரகனமரனத பமறதசசரனதன டரரகதடரவனத பவனத பகதவயவலத சபரரதததபதபடதடளதள தணதணணரத படஙதகவனத பவனத இடத பகதகதததவலத பமரதவயதரலத வவபததத ஏறதபடதடத எனதற சசரனதனரலத சரவ தரனத . பமறதசசரனதன டரரகதடரத ஆனத சசடகளகதக தணதணணரத ஊறதறவகதசகரணதட சரலலயவனத லமய சவறதறவனத அரபக நவனதற சகரணதட இரநததத எனதற சசரனதனரலத சரவயலதல . சசடகளகதக தணதணணரத ஊறதறவகத சகரணதட சசனதற சகரணதட இரநததத . 8. P.W.2 has further deposed that the tractor does not exhibit any signal. It is not the case of the respondent that P.W.2 was not available at the spot during the occurrence of the accident. On the other hand, R.W.3, Sub­Inspector of Thudialur Police Station has been examined on behalf of the 3rd respondent and he has deposed that P.W.2 Ankuraj has MCOP . No. 396 of 2015 5 signed the Observation Mahazar and witnessed the preparation of rough sketch Ex.P.3 and as per their records, P.W.2 is not an occulur witness. The Learned Counsel for the 3rd respondent pointing out to the evidence of R.W.1 who said that P.W.2 has given a statement to the police that he came to the spot on hearing about the accident at 12.45 pm and argued that P.W.2 could not have witnessed the accident and his evidence is to be discarded. When such fact has not been confronted to P.W.2, then, the evidence of R.W.3 in this regard cannot be considered. Further, when the criminal case is still pending and the witnesses on the side of the prosecution are yet to be examined, even according to R.W.3, then, the alleged statement said to have been given by P.W.2 to the police cannot be admissible in evidence. If the statement given to the police by P.W.2 is considered to prove his absence during the occurrence, then, the charge sheet filed against the 1st respondent can also be taken to be true even prior to the trial in the criminal case. When, it is well settled principle of law that the statement given to the police is only a statement U/s.161 Cr.P.C and is not admissible and the charge sheet filed by the Investigation Officer is only a final report filed on completion of the investigation, both become inadmissible. On the other hand, from R.W.3's evidence, it has been made clear that P.W.2 was present at the spot. While so, the evidence of P.W.2 recorded in this court being the substantial evidence, it outweighs the statement U/s.161 Cr.P.C given by him. Though P.W.2 was cross examined in lengthy, it was not elicited that he was absent during the occurrence of the accident. Not even a suggestion has been made to him in this regard. Therefore, the evidence of P.W.2 cannot be disguarded on the basis of evidence of R.W.3. On the other hand, the cogent and relevant evidence of P.W.2 in corroboration to the evidence of P.W.1 is found to be reliable and proves the manner of the accident. Therefore, this court holds that the 1st respondent was driving the tractor involved in this accident, while pouring water to the plants that are standing in the median, near the scene of occurrence. Therefore, it is clear that the tractor was moving when the accident occurred. While so, the Citation MCOP . No. 396 of 2015 6 referred to by the Learned Counsel for the 3rd respondent S.Manjula Devi & S.Sibi Vs Brijpal Singh and 3 others reported in 2017 (1) TN MAC 5 (DB) which according to the 3rd respondent is a case law with similar facts, becomes inapplicable to the present case before hand, as here, the 3rd respondent has failed to establish that the tractor was parked near centre median for watering the plants. Similarly, the other Citation referred to by the Learned Counsel for the 3rd respondent in Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Co Ltd., Vs Suganthi reported in 2018 (1) TN MAC 599 (DB) and United India Insurance Co Ltd Vs K.V.Prema & Others reported in 2006 (4) TLNJ 152 (Civil) our Hon'ble High Court has fixed negligence and liability on the part of the bus which hit against the parked lorry fixed at 60% and that of the lorry at 40% also stands distinguished from the case under discussion. 9. Yet another contention raised by the Learned Counsel for the 3rd respondent is that the deceased had the time and chance to avoid the accident and he failing to utilise such opportunity has to be proportionately liable for contributory negligence, referring to the evidence of P.W.2 who has admitted that if the deceased was riding the two wheeler on the left side in 30 feet road, the accident could have been avoided and his further evidence that the person travelling in a road, if was vigilant could have averted the situation at a distance of 10m from the ongoing vehicle in front of him. But, when P.W.2 has categorically stated that there were other vehicles going on the balance 23 feet available to the left of the tractor, which was occupying 7 feet in the road, it explains why the deceased could not avoid or prevent the MCOP . No. 396 of 2015 7 accident even when he had a chance to see the vehicle in his front. The above said evidence of P.W.2 remains undisputed and hence it aptly explains why the deceased could not avert the accident even applying the Doctrine of RES IPSO LOQUITOR, meaning test of Causation. Having held so, the Citation referred to by the Learned Counsel for the 3rd respondent in 2006 (4) TLNJ 152 (Civil) does not come to his aid. 10. Now, coming back to the contention of the Learned Counsel for the 3rd respondent as to differential user of the vehicle, I.e,tractor concerned, watering a plant cannot be considered to be a differential user of a vehicle meant for agricultural purposes. Now, there being scarcity of water, the farmers have started to water their fields using tankers. Though this sort of usage is scanty, day is not far away when tankers will be utilized vastly for irrigation for agricultural purposes. Therefore, the tanker that is spoken to in this case being used for watering the plants in the median, though it is flowering plant, also can be included as agriculture, just because other flowering plants if commercial purpose of irrigation, is not termed as commercial purpose. 11. The Learned Counsel for the 3rd respondent argued that the Post mortem report revealing that right side face was deformed to indicate that the deceased was not wearing helmet and hence, contributory negligence is to be fixed upon the deceased. In this regard, the Learned Counsel for the petitioner argued that contributory negligence has to be pleaded and proved and based on his argumens on the decision rendered in the Citation in Pongiammal & others Vs R.Chinnarasu & Others reported in 2014(1) TN MAC 135 wherein our Lordship S.Manikumar.J has held “Finding of contributory negligence in absence of any pleading and MCOP . No. 396 of 2015 8 proof, if, justified – Insurer in Counter merely denied negligence on part of Bus driver – No specific plea raised setting up defence of contributory negligence – Mere non­marking of rough sketch not a reason to draw adverse inference against Claimant.................. ­ Finding of contributory negligence on part of deceased, therefore, set aside”. 12. In this case, the 3rd respondent has not pleaded contributing negligence and hence this court finds the Judgment rendered in 2014(1) TN MAC 135 to be applicable rather than the decision in 2017 TNMAC 423 as the contributing negligence has not been pleaded. 13. Whether the tractor was moving at slow speed or parked, as argued by the Learned Counsel for the 3rd respondent, it ought to have exhibited the proper signal. In its absence and when the MVI reports reveal that the RHS of the two wheeler and tanker's rear LHS are damaged suggestive of the manner of the accident supports the evidence of P.W.2, resulting in the conclusion that the driver of the tractor (I.e), the 1st respondent was the cause for the accident making the owner and also the insurer liable to indemnify the deceased. 14. The further contention of the 3rd respondent is that the tractor has been used for hiring for commercial purpose and it is a commercial vehicle which is against the policy conditions and on that score also the 3rd respondent is not liable to indemnify the insured, admittedly, the 1st respondent whose policy copy is marked as Ex.R.1. There is no evidence for the tractor being hired. Hence, it cannot be called to be used for commercial purpose. 15. Yet another contention put forth by the 3rd respondent is that the tractor alone has been insured and not the tanker and hence the 3rd respondent is not liable to pay compensation. In this regard, the Learned Counsel for the petitioners argued that when the tractor is insured, the tanker attached to the same need not be insured separately as the tanker MCOP . No. 396 of 2015 9 without the tractor cannot move about and hence it cannot be termed as motor vehicle, independent of the tractor and when the tractor is insured, it extends to the tanker also, making the 3rd respondent liable. To support his argument, the Learned Counsel for the 3rd respondent pointed out to the evidence of R.W.2 Shanmugasundaram who is Motor Vehicle Inspector in RTO North who has deposed that the tanker has neither been registered nor insured and it has been driven in the road against the insurance policy and law. This court does not concede with the evidence of R.W.2 that a vehicle that has been earmarked for agricultural use cannot be run on roads. R.W.2 is not speaking about differential user to assert the driving of the vehicle on road to be unlawful. To say in his words வவவசரய உபபயரகதததவறதக பயனதபடமத ஒர டரரகதடலர பதவவ சசயதயபதபடரத படஙதகலர இலணததத சரலலயவலத ஓடதடசதசசலதவத சடதடதததவறதக மரணரனத . When neither the tanker nor the trailer has any engine to move the same, it has to be necessarily attached to the tractor which has the engine to move about. It is the case of none that the trailer or the tanker is meant for agricultural purpose as a machinery. Even for agricultural purposes, the trailer has to be attached to the tractor and moved to the place, where agricultural work is going on. 16. This court finds here appropriate to refer to definition given to the term motor vehicle as defined in Section 2(28) of MV Act. “2(28) 'motor vehicle' or 'vehicle' means any mechanically propelled vehicle adapted for use upon roads whether the power of propulsion is transmitted thereto from an external or internal source and includes a chasis to which a body has not been attached and a trailer; but does not include a vehicle running upon fixed rails or a vehicle of a special type adapted for use only in a factory or in any other enclosed premises or a vehicle having less than four wheels fitted with engine capacity of not exceeding twenty­five cubic centimetres”. MCOP . No. 396 of 2015 10 17. From the above said definition, it is clear that the tanker becomes a motor vehicle when it is attached to the tractor enabling to move. It also gives another preposition that without tractor, the tanker would not be able to move. While so, the insurance coverage available to the tractor would be extended to the tanker when the same is attached to the tractor. The High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad has gone to the extent of fixing the liability on the tanker even when it is not attached to the tractor, even when both were not used simultaneously in a case in Santokben Anupsing Chauhan and others Vs Sursing Motibhai Baria and others reported in 2016 ACJ 2367 The relevant portion in the above said Judgment is extracted below : “The term 'motor vehicle' has been defined in Section 2(28) of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 : “2(28) 'motor vehicle' or 'vehicle' means any mechanically propelled vehicle adapted for use upon roads whether the power of propulsion is transmitted thereto from an external or internal source and includes a chasis to which a body has not been attached and a trailer; but does not include a vehicle running upon fixed rails or a vehicle of a special type adapted for use only in a factory or in any other enclosed premises or a vehicle having less than four wheels fitted with engine capacity of not exceeding twenty­five cubic centimetres”. “The term 'tractor' has been defined in Section 2(44) of the said Act as under : “2(44) 'tractor' means a motor vehicle which is not itself constructed to carry any load (other than equipment used for the purpose of propulsion); but MCOP . No. 396 of 2015 11 excludes a road­roller'. “The term 'trailer' has been defined in Section 2(46) as under : “2(46) 'trailer' means any vehicle, other than a semi­trailer and a side­car, drawn or intended to be drawn by a motor vehicle”. “Any vehicle which is mechanically propelled and is adapted for use upon roads, whether such propulsion is transmitted from an extenal or internal source, is a motor vehicle. It includes chassis to which a body has not been attached and a trailer. The definition of the term 'motor vehicle' thus is provided in the means and includes expression. In the includes portion trailer is specifically covered. For better clarification, the word 'trailer' itself has been defined U/s.2(46) as to mean any vehicle other than a semi­trailer and a side­car drawn or intended to be drawn by a motor vehicle. The fact that the trailer in question was one which would be covered U/s.2(46) of the Act is beyond dispute. By virtue of section 2(28) of the Act, such trailer when attached to a mechanically propelled vehicle becomes a motor vehicle. It is, therefore, not possible to accept the contention of the insuance company that the trailer is not a motor vehicle. “When such a motor vehicle was being driven by the licensed driver and which, as concluded above, was being driven in a rash and negligent manner, the insurance company, which had insured such trailer, is duty bound to cover the risk of a third party who may receive any injury on account of accident arising out of use of such motor vehicle and resulting from such rash and negligent act of the driver. As recorded earlier, but for the trailer, being joined to the tractor, the accident in question would not have occurred. This is one more reason to hold the insurance company of the trailer liable to satisfy the award in its entirety. The insurance company could have avoided its liability if it is established that a condition of the insurance required the insured to use the trailer only with a specific tractor which was covered under MCOP . No. 396 of 2015 12 the insurance policy. This admittedly is not the case before us. As conceded by the witness of the insurance company, neither the insurance policy nor the cover note specified any such condition. Merely because the insurance policy was issued with respect to a particular tractor and the trailer in question would not imply any condition that the same must be used simultaneously so as to be able to enjoy the insurance coverage. In absence of any such condition, the owner cannot be deprived of the insurance coverage and at any rate, the third party cannot be deprived of the right to full compensation. Insurance is a contract of indemnity. No condition which does not form part of such contract can be read by implications”. Here also, there is no contract specifically stating that either tanker should not be attached or that it cannot be plighed on road. While so, 1st respondent cannot be said to have violated the condition of the policy. 18. In this regard, Rajasthan High Court also held in the same line in National Insurance Company Vs Bhebha Ram & another reported in 2016 ACJ 2355 wherein it is held as follows : “Insurance company contended that thresher was not insured and since premium was paid only for tractor driver insurance company cannot be held liable for khalasi or any other labourer working with the tractor – Thresher attached to a tractor does not require independent registration and insurance and licence to drive a tractor does not become ineffective when a thresher / trolley is attached to the tractor – Whether insurance company is liable – Held : Yes” In the backlight of the above decision, this court finds the arguments of the Learned Counsel for the 3rd respondent does not holdgood. MCOP . No. 396 of 2015 13 19. As far as the age of the deceased is concerned, Ex.P.10, the driving licence reveals the date of birth of the deceased as 10.06.1986 and if calculated, the age of the deceased comes to 29 years. 20. The petitioner has examined P.W.3 A.R.Parthiban to prove the income of the deceased. His evidence together with Ex.X4, the statement of salary, Ex.X1, the authorization letter for P.W.3 and Ex.X.2, the monthly attendance Approval Format would prove that M/s.Stalwart Security Services India Ltd had given the authorization letter for P.W.3, an employer in the concern to depose and to produce the salary details of the deceased marked as Ex.X4 proves the avocation of the deceased. As regards the quantum of compensation is concerned, the Learned Counsel for 3rd respondent argued that net salary is to be considered for the calculation for deciding the quantum. But, our High Court has taken a different view in a case in Oriental Insurance Co Ltd VS Venkateswari reported in 2017 (1) TNMAC 652 (DB) wherein it has been clearly held that gross salary has to be taken into consideration and not net salary. Even considering the gross salary, the deceased would not be assessable the income tax on the date of the accident. Hence, following, the above said decision of Division Bench of our High Court, this court fixes the income of the deceased to be the gross salary which is at Rs.11,419/­ per month. 21. The appropriate multiplier in terms of the decision of Constitution Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in National Insurance Company Ltd .vs. Pranay Sethi and others reported as 2017 (2) TNMAC 609 SC is 16 . In view of the subsequent decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Hem Raj .vs. Oriental Insurance Company Limited and others reported as 2017 (2) TNMAC 758 : CDJ 2018 SC MCOP . No. 396 of 2015 14 194, there cannot be distinction between claims where income is supported by positive evidence and the claims where minimum income is determined notionally. In the said decision, it has also been held that, future prospects is to be assessed in both the situations on same footing. Therefore, this Tribunal arrives at the compensation payable by the respondents to the petitioners in the following manner : Compensation: 1. Monthly income of deceased Rs.11,419/­ 2. Deceased being of the age of 29 years, 40% future prospects ought to be added. Rs. 4,568/­ Rs.15,987/­ 3. Deceased being married and the three petitioners are dependants, 1/3 of the income is to be deducted for his personal expenses. Rs. 5,329/­ 4. Multiplicant (1+2)­3) Rs.10,658/­ 5. Deceased was aged 29 years at the time of her death. Hence, the multiplier of 17 is being adopted. 17 6. Compensation Rs.10658X12X17 Rs. 21,74,232/­ 7. Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/­ 8.

This petition has been filed under Sections 140, 141, 163(A), 163 (B), 166 & 182(A) of Motor Vehicle Act r/w Rule 3(1) of M.A.C.T Rules seeking compensation of MCOP 960 of 2015 2 Rs.45,00,000/­ with subsequent interest from the date of the accident till the realization of compensation amount and costs. 2. The claim of the petitioners is that on 13.03.2015 at about 7.45 a.m when the deceased C.Velu was riding a Hero Honda Passion Plus Motor Cycle bearing Regn.No.TN­38­AM­2998 from his house at Periyanaickenpalayam to his work place at Chinnavedampatty in North South Periyanaickenpalayam to Athippalayam main road and when he came near to the Balaji Nagar, at that time, a Maruti Omni Van bearing Regn.No.TN 38 BT 2089 driven by the 1st respondent from South to North direction in rash and negligent manner with great speed without following any traffic rules and regulations in the opposite direction tried to overtake another Vehicle which was also driven with very high speed and deviated from left side of the road to right side and dashed against the Motor Cycle with high force and due to that collision, the deceased C.Velu fell down on the road from the Motor Cycle and sustained grievous injuries in his head and all over the body and admitted in Ganga Hospital, Coimbatore as in patient from 13.03.2015, but he died on 14.03.2015. The deceased is claimed to be 42 years, at the time of his death and that the above said petitioners are dependents on him, have come up with the present petition seeking compensation, contending that it was the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent due to which, the accident occurred and that 1st respondent who is the driver, 2nd respondent who is the owner cum insured and the 3rd respondent who is the insurer of the Maruti Omni Van are liable to pay compensation to them. 3. The 1st respondent has not filed any counter statement. The 2nd respondent filed a counter statement and contended that on 13.03.2015, the 1st respondent was driving the Maruti Omni Van belonging to the 2nd respondent company bearing Regn.No.TN 38 BT 2089 from South to North in Periyanaickenpalayam Athipalayam main road at a very moderate speed and on the left side of the road and when the vehicle neared Balaji Nagar, the deceased C.Velu who was riding a Hero Honda Passion Plus Motor Cycle bearing Regn.No.TN 38 AM 2998 came in the opposite direction at breakneck speed and attempted to overtake another two wheeler and in the process, the deceased came to the extreme right side of the road and collided with Maruthi Omni Van driven by the 1st respondent. The accident occurred only due to the rash and negligent driving of the deceased. The Maruti Omni Van is comprehensively insured with the 3rd respondent company under Policy No.0000000001661550. MCOP 960 of 2015 3 4. The 3rd respondent filed a counter statement and contended that the accident has taken place only due to the sole negligence of the deceased who drove the vehicle negligently without any care and caution at the time of accident and caused the accident by dashing against the Omni Van bearing Regn.No.TN 38 BT 2089 driven by the 1st respondent. The deceased was not wearing a helmet at the time of accident. The Omni Van bearing Regn.No.TN­38­BT­2089 driven by the 1st respondent was not insured with this respondent at the time of accident. The 1st respondent was not having a valid and effective driving license to drive the Omni Van. 5. The points that arise for consideration are i) Whether the petition mentioned accident occurred due to the 1st respondent's negligent driving of the Omni Van bearing Reg.No. TN 38 BT 2089 ? ii) Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation? iii) If so, what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners ? 6. In support of the petitioners' contentions, 1st petitioner has examined herself as P.W.1, one Amirtharaj as P.W.2 and one Balasubramaniyan as P.W.3 and Ex.P1 to Ex.P.18 have been marked on the side of the petitioner. The 1st respondent has examined himself as R.W.1 and no documents have been marked on the side of the respondent. Ex.X1 & Ex.X2 have been marked through witnesses. 7. Heard both. Perused the materials on record. The claim of the petitioners that the 1st respondent's rash and negligent driving had caused the accident. This has been supported by the evidence of PW2, who had stated that he saw the accident who was riding his motor cycle at the time of accident and the said Omni Van hit the vehicle driven by P.W.2 also. Nothing has been elicited during the cross examination of P.W.1 & P.W.2, warranting any doubt about the veracity of their evidence. 8. The 3rd respondent has examined the 1st respondent as R.W.1. When the 1st respondent remained Exparte in this case without raising any objections to the averments in the petition or the manner of the accident, then, he has no loco standi to MCOP 960 of 2015 4 depose about the manner of the accident on behalf of the 3rd respondent. Hence, his evidence cannot be relied upon. Further more, when the charge sheet in Crime No.107/2015 has been filed against the 1st respondent, he is an interested witness and hence his evidence is not reliable. Further, when there is no charge against the deceased for not wearing helmet and when there is no other evidences except the 1st respondent, the deceased cannot be said to have violated the motor vehicle laws by not wearing the helmet. 9. There is no dispute in the death of the deceased C.Velu. Ex.P.1, the First Information report, Ex.P.2, the post­mortem certificate and Ex.P.3 the death certificate of the deceased proves the death of the deceased C.Velu. Ex.P.9 proves that the petitioners to be the legal heirs of the deceased. Ex.P.3, Ex.P.4 & Ex.P.5 proves that there is no mechanical defect in the vehicles involved in the accident and thereby the accident cannot be held to be due to any mechanical defect of either of the vehicles. 10. As far as the age of the deceased is concerned, t here is no dispute as to the age of the deceased C.Velu. It is revealed from Ex.P.11, the copy of driving licence of the deceased, the date of birth to be 23.05.1973 and if calculated, the age of the victim to be 41 years and 10 months. As such, the age of the deceased is fixed as 41 years. 11. There is no dispute that the deceased C.Velu was working as a contractor under CRI Pumps (P) Ltd. Ex.P.16 would evince the credit and debit statement. The Income Tax returns for the Assessment Year 2007­2008 would show his annual income to be Rs.1,64,244/­ and for the Assessment Year 2008­2009 as Rs.1,68,190/­. Ex.P.16 also shows the traces and Form 16A of the deceased C.Velu, wherein the TDS collected from the deceased for payments under 194(c) ranges from Rs.9532/­ to Rs.20601/­ per quarter. The Learned Counsel for the 3rd respondent argued that the statement in Ex.P.16 cannot be considered to be the proof for the income of the deceased, but it is only payments made under 194(c) to a Contractor including the wages payable to the labourers. This court finds force in such contention of the Learned Counsel for the 3rd respondent. However, the further arguments proposed on behalf of the 3rd respondent that notional income has to be fixed does not find acceptability of this court. Considering Ex.P.16 and Ex.P.15­Form D, the Registration copy of 'Sudharsana Industries', wherein the photograph of the deceased has been affixed proves the business carried on by the deceased. Ex.P.16 would show that the payments under 194(c) has MCOP 960 of 2015 5 been gradually increasing from 2007 till 2013 and while so, it can be taken in to account that the gross payable income of the deceased would have proportionately increased as per the payments under 194(c). Therefore, it is clear that the annual income of the deceased would be more than Rs.1,68,190/­ which is the income shown for the Assessment Year 2008­2009. The evidence of P.W.1 & P.W.3 who have deposed that the income of the deceased C.Velu at Rs.45,000/­ per month cannot be acceptable. However, the evidence of P.W.1 and P.W.3 that the deceased C.Velu was doing the sale of second hand machineries, in addition to supplying labourers on contract to CRI Pumps (P) Ltd remains undisputed. While so, the Learned Counsel for the 3rd respondent's contention that notional income is to be fixed also does not seem to be reasonable. Therefore, considering the above facts and circumstances, this court fixes the income of the deceased to be at Rs.20,000/­ per month. 12. The appropriate multiplier in terms of the decision of Constitution Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in National Insurance Company Ltd .vs. Pranay Sethi and others reported as 2017 (2) TNMAC 609 SC is 16 . In view of the subsequent decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Hem Raj .vs. Oriental Insurance Company Limited and others reported as 2017 (2) TNMAC 758 : CDJ 2018 SC 194, there cannot be distinction between claims where income is supported by positive evidence and the claims where minimum income is determined notionally. In the said decision, it has also been held that, future prospects is to be assessed in both the situations on same footing. Therefore, t his Tribunal arrives at the compensation payable by the respondents to the petitioners in the following manner : Compensation: 1. Monthly income of deceased Rs. 20,000/­ 2. Deceased being of the age of 41 years, 25% future prospects ought to be added. Rs. 5,000/­ Rs.25,000/­ 3. Deceased being married and the five petitioners are dependants, 1/4 of the income is to be deducted for hisRs. 6250/­ MCOP 960 of 2015 6 personal expenses. 4. Multiplicant (1+2)­3) Rs.18,750/­ 5. Deceased was aged 41 years at the time of his death. Hence, the multiplier of 14 is being adopted. 14 6. Compensation Rs.18750X12X14 Rs. 31,50,000/­ 7. Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/­ 8. Loss of consortium Rs. 40,000/­ 9. Funeral Expenses Rs. 15,000/­ Total Compensation awarded Rs. 32,20,000/­ 13. In the result, an award is passed for a sum of Rs.32,20,000/­ payable by the respondents to the petitioners with interest at 7.5% per annum from 09.09.2015, the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. Out of the said sum, the 1st petitioner is entitled for Rs.10,20,000/­ of claim amount, 2nd & 3rd petitioners are entitled for each Rs.7,00,000/­ of claim amount and 4th & 5th petitioners are entitled for each Rs.4,00,000/ ­. After deposit, the 1st, 4th & 5th petitioners are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount with interest immediately. The share of the minor 2nd & 3rd petitioners shall be fully deposited in a Nationalized Bank till they attain majority and the 1st petitioner is entitled to draw interest on the minors share periodically.

The 1st respondent was no fault on the driving and the MCOP 766 of 2015 3 insured vehicle was on the proper side of alleged road and hence the 3rd respondent is not an indemnifier to pay any compensation to the petitioner. The deceased vehicle has been designed for carrying only two person, but on the alleged date three persons were travelled and it is against law and violation of MV rules. Further, one person was sitting in front bar of the cycle and so the deceased was not able to vision the road and hence the accident.

The allegations that the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent is false. The deceased was the root cause of the alleged accident and he drove the vehicle No: TN 38-Y-3530 and dashed against the 1st respondent vehicle. The alleged accident took place in the middle of the road by the rash and negligence of the deceased. The cause and mode of the alleged accident are denied and the petitioners are put to strict proof of the same with documentary evidence.

POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle Hero Honda Pleasure bearing its Registration No. TN 38 BS 7938 on 30-08-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 4. If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 5.On behalf of the petitioner, the petitioner was examined as PW-1, and one Dinesh Kumar was examined as PW-2, and one Karthikeyan was examined as PW-3, and 17 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P17. On behalf of the defendants no witness has been examined and no documents were marked. On behalf of the witness 3 documents were marked as Ex.X1 to Ex.X3. 7 POINT No.1: Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle Hero Honda Pleasure bearing its Registration No. TN 38 BS 7938 on 30-08-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 6.The case of the petitioner is that on 30-08-2015 the deceased Selvaraj was riding in his two wheeler bearing registration No. TN 38 Y 3530 in the Coimbatore to Sakthi Main road. Further case of the petitioner is that on that day the deceased was proceeding to his company JEM Pattern Works and on the way when he turned to his right after proper indication and sound however all of a sudden the two wheeler bearing registration NO. TN 38 BS 7938 dashed against the deceased vehicle who came in a rash and negligent manner. Due to the said accident the deceased was thrown away on the road and sustained multiple injuries all over his body. Further case of the petitioners is that the 1st respondent is the driver cum owner of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the insurer of the offending vehicle. Hence as the accident had occurred due to the rash and negligent act of the 1st respondent both the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 7.Whereas the contention of the 2nd respondent is that the rider of the offending vehicle was not holding in a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the alleged accident. Hence there is a violation of the conditions of policy. Further they would contend that as the conditions in the policy is violated the insurance company is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 8.Further contentions of the 2nd respondent is that they denied the place, date, time and mode of the alleged accident. Further it is also equally false to allege that it is the first respondent who has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. As a matter of fact it is the deceased who was the root cause of the alleged accident since the accident took place in the middle of the road. 9.This Court as given its anxious consideration on the rival contentions of both the parties. On perusal of Ex.P1 F.I.R it reveals that a case is registered as against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s 279 and 304 (A) I.P.C. On perusal of Ex.P2 rough sketch the place of accident is shown. Further on perusal of Ex.P3 M.V . Report in respect of vehicle driven by the 1st respondent it reveals that the 1st respondent was in possession of a valid driving license and the said vehicle is insured under R2. Hence the contention of the 2nd respondent is that the driver of the offending 8 vehicle drove his vehicle without a valid driving licence false to the ground. Further on perusal of Ex.P4 it reveals that the concerned Police has laid his final report as against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s 279 and 304 (A) I.P.C. Further on perusal of Ex.P5 Post mortem certificate the Doctor has opined that the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries and no adverse remarks is mentioned against the deceased. Further the petitioners have also examined PW2 Dinesh Kumar who is the eye witness to the accident. In the chief examination he has categorically deposed that the 1st respondent has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the vehicle of the deceased. Though the PW-2 was elaborately cross examined nothing was able to extract in support of their contention. 10.Therefore taking into consideration of the available materials in hand this court is of the considered view that the petitioner have prima facie established that the 1st respondent alone has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident due to which the deceased died. Hence Point NO 1 is answered against the 1st respondent. POINT NO. 2: Who is liable to pay compensation? 11.Admittedly the 1st respondent is the driver -cum owner of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the insurer and as Point NO. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 12.The case of the petitioner is that the 1st petitioner is the wife of the deceased 2nd and 3rd petitioners are the daughters of the deceased and the 4th and 5th petitioners are the parents of the deceased Selvaraj. 13.Further case of the petitioners is that at the time of accident deceased Selvaraj was aged about 48 years, and he was hale ad healthy at the time of accident and he was working 9 in the Jem Patter works as a turner and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- per month and he also used to get a sum of Rs.5,000/- as extra wages by doing over time. Further case of the petitioners is that the deceased Selvaraj is the only bread winner of the family, and but for the accident he would have lived a long life. 14. Whereas the contention of the 2nd respondent is that it is false to allege that he was getting a sum of Rs.20,000/- p.m and the petitioners are depending upon the income of the deceased Selvaraj, The 2nd respondent would further contend that the claim amount is exorbitant and not sustainable in the eye of law. 15.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or the dependents of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 16.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may proceed to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 17.In order to prove that the deceased was employed and was considerably earning they examined P.W3 Karthiheyan who would depose that the deceased Selvaraj was working in his concern from 2013 onwards and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- of monthly remuneration. However during cross examination he has admitted that though he is running Sree Jem Pattern Works, no attendance register is maintained and his establishment is not registered under E.S.I. and P.F. Act. Further she has also admitted that no monthly salary is paid as such and depending upon 10 the duty the daily cooly is paid to the deceased and in respect of the same no document is maintained by him. On perusal of Ex.X2 it reveals that Srie Jem Works is registered under the Commercial Tax Department and Ex.X3 alleged salary certificate said to have issued by PW3 it is mentioned that the deceased was drawing a consolidated salary of Rs.15,000/- p.m. Further on perusal of Ex.P6 death certificate, It is admitted fact that deceased is died of road accident and Ex.P7 it reveals that the petitioners are the legal heirs of deceased Selvaraj, 18.On analyzing the materials in hand though P.W.3 would deposed that the deceased was employed at his establishment no material evidence is produced before this Court to prove the same. Though Ex.X2, X3 are marked the evidence of PW3 does not inspire the confidence of this Court. Hence considering the age of the deceased as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court Notional income of the deceased is taken into consideration to calculate the compensation. 19.As per the case of the petitioners the age of the deceased is 48 whereas in the post mortem certificate and in the death certificate the age of the deceased is mentioned as 51 Though the petitioners would alleged that deceased Selvaraj is aged about 48 no document evidence is produced to show that at the time of accident the deceased was aged about 48. Therefore the age of the deceased is fixed as 51 and a notional income of a sum of Rs.8,000/- is taken into consideration as monthly wages. And as per the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court a Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 11 and as there are 5 dependents 1/4th of the income of the deceased is deducted for his personal expenditure. 20.As per the latest Judgment Reported in 2017 (2) TN MAC 609 (SC) in the case between National Insurance Company Limited … Vs..... Pranay Sethi and others 10% of the income is taken as addition. Hence 10% of the income comes to Rs.800/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.8,000+ Rs.800/- which is comes to Rs.8,800/-. Hence s sum of Rs.8,800 /- is fixed as income of the deceased. 21.And as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 11 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court considering the marital status of the deceased 1/4 of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 11 22.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as the income of the deceased is Rs.8,800/-. Hence Rs.8,800 X 12 X 11 = Rs.11,61,600/- and 1/4th personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.2,90,400/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs. 11,61,600 – Rs.2,90,400 = Rs.8,71,200/- 23. Further as per the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for funeral expenses, and a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for loss of estate, and a sum of Rs.40,000/- was taken for loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner. 24.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.8,71,200/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/- 3 Funeral Expanes Rs. 15,000/- 4 Loss of consortium Rs. 40,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.9,41,200/- From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.19,41,200/- -towards compensation and the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.9,41,200/ -with interest . 25. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.6,41,200/-of claim amount, and the 2nd to 5th petitioners are entitled for each a sum of Rs.75,000/- of claim amount, Hence point Nos.3 & 4 are answered accordingly. In the result , the Respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.9,41,200/ - with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. And out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.6,41,200/- of claim amount and the 2nd to 5th Petitioners are entitled for each a sum of Rs.75,000/- of claim amount After deposit, all the petitioners are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount with 12 interest immediately.

The 3rd respondent filed a counter statement MCOP 317 of 2015 3 contending that the lorry had been parked in the extreme left side of the very wide road and the accident was caused only due to the rash and negligent driving of the Motor cycle bearing Regn.No.TN 38 BL 1156 by the deceased Raja @ Rajendran, who had more than enough space on the right side of the lorry to avoid the accident and it is on account of this reason, the 1st respondent is contesting the criminal case against him which is pending before Judicial Magistrate Court No.8, Coimbatore and if any compensation is decided in favour of the petitioners, the same deserves to be apportioned substantially against the deceased rider and partially against the respondents on account of significant and apparent negligence on the part of the deceased and the claim amount is high and this respondent is entitled to invoke Section 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act in the event of the driver and owner viz, the 1st and 2nd respondents are not contesting the case with requisite facts and in case of collusion between them and the petitioners and prays to dismiss the petition. 4. The points that arise for consideration are i) Whether the petition mentioned accident occurred due to the 1st respondent's negligence in driving the lorry bearing Regn.No.TN 28 AK 4410 ? ii) Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation? iii) If so, what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners ? 5. In support of the petitioners' contentions, 1st petitioner has examined herself as P.W.1, one Ananda Jothi as P.W.2 and one Ravi as P.W.3. Ex.P1 to Ex.P.18 have been marked on the side of the petitioners. There is no oral and documentary evidence let in on the side of the 3rd respondent. Ex.X1 to Ex.X3 have been marked through witness. 6. Heard. Perused the materials on record. The claim of the petitioners is that the 1st respondent's negligent driving of the lorry bearing Regn.No.TN 28 AK MCOP 317 of 2015 4 4410 had caused the accident. The 1st petitioner has examined herself as P.W.1 and deposed in consonance to the averments in the petition. The petitioner has examined one Ananda Jothi as P.W.2 who is the eye witness, has deposed that at the time of accident, he was standing near the spot and has witnessed the accident. P.W.2 though admits that he is not either cited as witness in criminal case filed upon Ex.P.1, FIR or as an attestor in Observation Mahazar, his witnessing the occurrence has not been denied in any way during his cross examination. Not even a suggestion has been made to P.W.2 that he was not available near the place of occurrence on the fateful day and time of the accident. While so, this court does not find anything to disbelieve the evidence of P.W.2 which is substantial evidence which stood the test of cross examination. Hence, the evidence to P.W.1 & P.W.2 together with Ex.P1 – First Information report & Ex.P2­ rough sketch proves the manner of the accident. 7. There is no dispute in the death of the deceased Raja @ Rajendran. Ex.P.1, the First Information Report, Ex.P.5, the Post mortem report and Ex.P.6, the death certificate proves the death of the deceased Raja @ Rajendran. 8. As far as the age of the deceased is concerned, there is no dispute in the age of the deceased. Ex.P.5 the post mortem report and Ex.P.6, the death certificate of the deceased reveals the age of the deceased as 29 years. As such, the age of the deceased is fixed as 29 years. 9. As far as the income of the deceased is concerned, P.W.1 has deposed that the deceased was doing hotel business and was earning Rs.15,000/­ per month. P.W.3 says that the deceased was paid Rs.600/­ per day for his mason work. The quantum of work depends upon the contract M/s.S.R.Builders is receiving. While so, the deceased cannot be considered to have received income regularly through his mason work. At an average, he might have been working for 20 days per month, which comes to 240 days per annum. It is the specific case of P.W.3 that the deceased was working as a mason during day time and he was looking after a petty shop relating to hotel business and the same remains MCOP 317 of 2015 5 undisputed even by way of a suggestion, then, this court does not find any reason to disbelieve the evidence of P.W.3. However, as already held that the deceased might have been working for 20 days per month. At an average, this court considered it reasonable to calculate the wages at Rs.300/­ per day, which is also not in dispute. For 20 days per month, it comes to Rs.6,000/­ per month. 10. Now, coming to the income from the petty shop. It is said to have been fetching an income at Rs.15,000/­ per month which cannot also be considered to be regular and uniform for every month. Therefore, this court is of considered view that a sum of Rs.3,000/­ can be taken as an income from the petty shop. Now, computing the income of the deceased as a mason and as owner of the petty shop and considering the number of family members, he was feeding and maintaining and considering that the 1st petitioner being the wife of the deceased is of the age 25 years during the accident having two children of aged 5 and 3 respectively who are the 2nd and 3rd petitioners respectively, this court fixes the income of the deceased to be Rs.9,000/­ per month. 11. Though Legal heirship certificate does not show the 5th petitioner as a legal heir of the deceased, she being the mother of the deceased, is not in dispute. While so, she become class 1 heir. It is well settled principle of law that it is not the heirship or a Succession OP to decide as to the heirship of the petitioners compensation payable under Motor Vehicles claim petition is based upon the dependency of the petitioners. When the 5th petitioner is the mother of the deceased, then, she is definitely dependent upon her son. Hence, she also becomes entitled along with petitioners 1 to 4 for compensation. 12. The petition was dismissed as against respondent No.2 on 15.03.2016 for not taking steps for service of summons upon it. Subsequently, the petition has been restored vide order passed in IA 457/2018 on 28.09.2018 and hence the petitioners are not entitled for any interest for the default period. 13. Further, during the pendency of this MCOP, the 3rd respondent filed a memo on 16.09.2016 stating that for the same cause of action, similar petition MCOP 317 of 2015 6 was filed and hence this petition is not maintainable, for which, the petitioners have filed a memo on 03.02.2017 stating that they have instructed their Counsel at Satyamangalam to “Not Press” the OP filed before Satyamangalam Court and copy of petition and “Not Press” order in MCOP 392/2013 is marked as Ex.P13 on the side of the petitioners. 14. The appropriate multiplier in terms of the decision of Constitution Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in National Insurance Company Ltd .vs. Pranay Sethi and others reported as 2017 (2) TNMAC 609 SC is 17 . In view of the subsequent decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Hem Raj .vs. Oriental Insurance Company Limited and others reported as 2017 (2) TNMAC 758 : CDJ 2018 SC 194, there cannot be any distinction between the claims where income is supported by positive evidence and the claims where minimum income is determined notionally. In the said decision, it has also been held that, future prospects is to be assessed in both the situations on same footing. Therefore, t his Tribunal arrives at the compensation payable by the respondents to the petitioners in the following manner : Compensation: 1. Monthly income of deceased Rs. 9,000/­ 2. Deceased being of the age of 29 years, 40% future prospects ought to be added. Rs. 3,600/­ Rs.12,600/­ 3. Deceased being married and the five petitioners are dependents, 1/4th of the income is to be deducted for his personal expenses. Rs.3,150/­ 4. Multiplicant (1+2)­3) Rs.9,450/­ MCOP 317 of 2015 7 5. Deceased was aged 29 years at the time of his death. Hence, the multiplier of 17 is being adopted. 17 6. Compensation Rs.9,450/­X12X17 Rs.19,27,800/­ 7. Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/­ 8. Funeral Expenses Rs. 15,000/­ 9. Loss of Consortium Rs. 40,000/­ Total Compensation awarded Rs.19,97,800/­ 15.

Claiming that, the deceased was 29 years at the time of his death and he was doing hotel business and earning a sum of Rs.15,000/­ per month and the above said petitioners are dependents on him, have come up with the present petition seeking compensation, contending that it was the carelessness of the 1st respondent, who is the driver of the vehicle and hence 1st respondent, the driver, the 2nd respondent, the owner and the 3rd respondent is the insurer of the lorry bearing Regn.No.TN 28 AK 4410 are liable to pay compensation to them. The SI of Police, Traffic Investigation Wing (East) Police Station, Coimbatore has registered a case against the 1st respondent U/s.279 and 304(A) IPC in Crime No.298/2012 dated 15.10.2012, the criminal case had been tried by the Learned Judicial Magistrate No.VIII, Coimbatore. 3. Though notice serviced to the 1st respondent, there is no representation and hence the 1st respondent set exparte on 21.01.2016. There is no representation for the petitioners from 16.02.2016 to 15.03.2016 and service for the 2nd respondent not taken and hence the petition was dismissed as against the 2nd respondent on 15.03.2016 and on petition, the same was restored with respect to the 2nd respondent on 28.09.2018. Subsequently, fresh notice issued to the 2nd respondent and Memo of service filed and the 2nd respondent called absent and there is no representation. Hence, the 2nd respondent called absent and set exparte on 14.12.2018. The 3rd respondent filed a counter statement MCOP 317 of 2015 3 contending that the lorry had been parked in the extreme left side of the very wide road and the accident was caused only due to the rash and negligent driving of the Motor cycle bearing Regn.No.TN 38 BL 1156 by the deceased Raja @ Rajendran, who had more than enough space on the right side of the lorry to avoid the accident and it is on account of this reason, the 1st respondent is contesting the criminal case against him which is pending before Judicial Magistrate Court No.8, Coimbatore and if any compensation is decided in favour of the petitioners, the same deserves to be apportioned substantially against the deceased rider and partially against the respondents on account of significant and apparent negligence on the part of the deceased and the claim amount is high and this respondent is entitled to invoke Section 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act in the event of the driver and owner viz, the 1st and 2nd respondents are not contesting the case with requisite facts and in case of collusion between them and the petitioners and prays to dismiss the petition. 4. The points that arise for consideration are i) Whether the petition mentioned accident occurred due to the 1st respondent's negligence in driving the lorry bearing Regn.No.TN 28 AK 4410 ? ii) Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation? iii) If so, what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners ? 5. In support of the petitioners' contentions, 1st petitioner has examined herself as P.W.1, one Ananda Jothi as P.W.2 and one Ravi as P.W.3. Ex.P1 to Ex.P.18 have been marked on the side of the petitioners. There is no oral and documentary evidence let in on the side of the 3rd respondent. Ex.X1 to Ex.X3 have been marked through witness. 6. Heard. Perused the materials on record. The claim of the petitioners is that the 1st respondent's negligent driving of the lorry bearing Regn.No.TN 28 AK MCOP 317 of 2015 4 4410 had caused the accident. The 1st petitioner has examined herself as P.W.1 and deposed in consonance to the averments in the petition. The petitioner has examined one Ananda Jothi as P.W.2 who is the eye witness, has deposed that at the time of accident, he was standing near the spot and has witnessed the accident. P.W.2 though admits that he is not either cited as witness in criminal case filed upon Ex.P.1, FIR or as an attestor in Observation Mahazar, his witnessing the occurrence has not been denied in any way during his cross examination. Not even a suggestion has been made to P.W.2 that he was not available near the place of occurrence on the fateful day and time of the accident. While so, this court does not find anything to disbelieve the evidence of P.W.2 which is substantial evidence which stood the test of cross examination. Hence, the evidence to P.W.1 & P.W.2 together with Ex.P1 – First Information report & Ex.P2­ rough sketch proves the manner of the accident. 7. There is no dispute in the death of the deceased Raja @ Rajendran. Ex.P.1, the First Information Report, Ex.P.5, the Post mortem report and Ex.P.6, the death certificate proves the death of the deceased Raja @ Rajendran. 8. As far as the age of the deceased is concerned, there is no dispute in the age of the deceased. Ex.P.5 the post mortem report and Ex.P.6, the death certificate of the deceased reveals the age of the deceased as 29 years. As such, the age of the deceased is fixed as 29 years. 9. As far as the income of the deceased is concerned, P.W.1 has deposed that the deceased was doing hotel business and was earning Rs.15,000/­ per month. P.W.3 says that the deceased was paid Rs.600/­ per day for his mason work. The quantum of work depends upon the contract M/s.S.R.Builders is receiving. While so, the deceased cannot be considered to have received income regularly through his mason work. At an average, he might have been working for 20 days per month, which comes to 240 days per annum. It is the specific case of P.W.3 that the deceased was working as a mason during day time and he was looking after a petty shop relating to hotel business and the same remains MCOP 317 of 2015 5 undisputed even by way of a suggestion, then, this court does not find any reason to disbelieve the evidence of P.W.3. However, as already held that the deceased might have been working for 20 days per month. At an average, this court considered it reasonable to calculate the wages at Rs.300/­ per day, which is also not in dispute. For 20 days per month, it comes to Rs.6,000/­ per month. 10. Now, coming to the income from the petty shop. It is said to have been fetching an income at Rs.15,000/­ per month which cannot also be considered to be regular and uniform for every month. Therefore, this court is of considered view that a sum of Rs.3,000/­ can be taken as an income from the petty shop. Now, computing the income of the deceased as a mason and as owner of the petty shop and considering the number of family members, he was feeding and maintaining and considering that the 1st petitioner being the wife of the deceased is of the age 25 years during the accident having two children of aged 5 and 3 respectively who are the 2nd and 3rd petitioners respectively, this court fixes the income of the deceased to be Rs.9,000/­ per month. 11. Though Legal heirship certificate does not show the 5th petitioner as a legal heir of the deceased, she being the mother of the deceased, is not in dispute. While so, she become class 1 heir. It is well settled principle of law that it is not the heirship or a Succession OP to decide as to the heirship of the petitioners compensation payable under Motor Vehicles claim petition is based upon the dependency of the petitioners. When the 5th petitioner is the mother of the deceased, then, she is definitely dependent upon her son. Hence, she also becomes entitled along with petitioners 1 to 4 for compensation. 12. The petition was dismissed as against respondent No.2 on 15.03.2016 for not taking steps for service of summons upon it. Subsequently, the petition has been restored vide order passed in IA 457/2018 on 28.09.2018 and hence the petitioners are not entitled for any interest for the default period. 13. Further, during the pendency of this MCOP, the 3rd respondent filed a memo on 16.09.2016 stating that for the same cause of action, similar petition MCOP 317 of 2015 6 was filed and hence this petition is not maintainable, for which, the petitioners have filed a memo on 03.02.2017 stating that they have instructed their Counsel at Satyamangalam to “Not Press” the OP filed before Satyamangalam Court and copy of petition and “Not Press” order in MCOP 392/2013 is marked as Ex.P13 on the side of the petitioners. 14. The appropriate multiplier in terms of the decision of Constitution Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India in National Insurance Company Ltd .vs. Pranay Sethi and others reported as 2017 (2) TNMAC 609 SC is 17 . In view of the subsequent decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Hem Raj .vs. Oriental Insurance Company Limited and others reported as 2017 (2) TNMAC 758 : CDJ 2018 SC 194, there cannot be any distinction between the claims where income is supported by positive evidence and the claims where minimum income is determined notionally. In the said decision, it has also been held that, future prospects is to be assessed in both the situations on same footing. Therefore, t his Tribunal arrives at the compensation payable by the respondents to the petitioners in the following manner : Compensation: 1. Monthly income of deceased Rs. 9,000/­ 2. Deceased being of the age of 29 years, 40% future prospects ought to be added. Rs. 3,600/­ Rs.12,600/­ 3. Deceased being married and the five petitioners are dependents, 1/4th of the income is to be deducted for his personal expenses. Rs.3,150/­ 4. Multiplicant (1+2)­3) Rs.9,450/­ MCOP 317 of 2015 7 5. Deceased was aged 29 years at the time of his death. Hence, the multiplier of 17 is being adopted. 17 6. Compensation Rs.9,450/­X12X17 Rs.19,27,800/­ 7. Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/­ 8. Funeral Expenses Rs. 15,000/­ 9. Loss of Consortium Rs. 40,000/­ Total Compensation awarded Rs.19,97,800/­ 15. In the result, an award is passed for a sum of Rs.19,97,800/­ payable by the respondents to the petitioners with interest at 7.5% per annum from 11.09.2015, the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. The petitioners are not entitled for interest for the period from 15.03.2016 to 28.09.2018 with respect to the 3rd respondent. The 1st petitioner is entitled for Rs.5,97,800/­ of claim amount. The minor 2nd and 3rd petitioners are entitled for Rs.5,00,000/­ each of claim amount. The 4th & 5th petitioners are entitled for Rs.2,00,000/­ each of claim amount.

But their imagination and expectations vanished and shattered into pieces irretrievably. vi)The first respondent who was driver cum owner of Tata Indica Car bearing registration number TN 37 AT – 5775 is solely liable for the said accident due to rash and negligent driving.

When both of them where proceeding on the Trichy-Karur main road from East to West direction at about 02.00 p.m. suddenly the 1st Respondent lost control over the vehicle, with the result the car dashed against the pedestrian by name Paramasivam standing on the road. Thereafter, due to the accident the car was capsized near a bank of branch river. The said Paramasivam sustained multiple injuries all over his body and the deceased who was in the car sustained grievous injuries all over his body and the 1st respondent also sustained multiple injuries because of the accident. All the three injured persons were immediately rushed to the nearby Government Hospital, Kulithalai with the help of a 108 Ambulance. Later, deceased Manivannan was shifted to Government Hospital, Trichy for further treatment. However not responding to treatment the deceased died on 30.03.2015 at about 01.30 P.M., Later in the same hospital on the same day post mortem was conducted. 8.Further case of the petitioner is that due to the sudden demise of the deceased Manivannan, all the petitioners are under great mental shock, agony and they are severely facing financial constraints since the deceased is the sole bread winner of the entire family who looked after the family very comfortably. Because of the cruel accident their imagination and expectation where shattered. 9.Further case of the petitioners is that the 1st respondent who is the owner cum driver of the offending vehicle Tata Indica Car bearing Registration No.TN 37AT 5775 he is liable for the said accident because of his rash and negligent driving. As 6 against 1st respondent the Lalapettai P.S. has registered a case for the offences u/s.279, 337 and 304(A) IPC in Cr.No.78/2015 dated 30.03.2015. 10.Further case of the petitioners is that the deceased was active hale and healthy prior to the unexpected accident. The deceased Manivannan was unfortunately trapped into the cruel accident at his young age of 28 years. But for the accident, he could have lived in good health till 65 to 75 years of age in standard life span. At her young age the 1st petitioner has lost her spouse and the 2nd petitioner who was 3 moths old at the time of accident had lost his lovable father. Similarly Petitioners 3 & 4 the parents of the deceased Manivannan have lost their lovable and carrying son. 11.Further case of the petitioners is that though no quantum of compensation would help of the petitioners to get back the deceased Manivannan alive but for the sake of social justice and for livelihood of petitioners in the materialistic world the compensation is preferred under relevant heads which is restricted to Rs.20 Lakh which is just fair and reasonable amount. 12.The 1st respondent who is the driver cum owner of the offending vehicle Tata Indica Car bearing Registration No.TN 37AT 5775 and the 2nd respondent who is the insurer of the above said vehicle are jointly and severally liable to pay as claimed by the petitioners. 13.This court has given its anxious consideration on the contentions of the Petitioners. The case of the petitioner is that on 29.03.2015 the deceased Manivannan was travelling in a car Tata Indica Car bearing Registration No.TN 37AT 5775 driven by 1st respondent. When both of them where proceeding on the Trichy-Karur main road from East to West at about 02.00 P.M. suddenly R1 lost control over the vehicle, with the result the car dashed against the pedestrian by name Paramasivam standing on the road. Thereafter, due to the accident the car was capsized near a bank of branch river. The said Paramasivam sustained multiple injuries all over his body and 7 the deceased who was in the car sustained grievous injuries all over his body and the 1st respondent also sustained multiple injuries because of the accident. 14.Further on perusal of Ex.P1 it appears that the concerned police has registered an F.I.R. for the offence u/s.279, 337 and 304(A) IPC and on perusal of Ex.P2 and Ex.P3 it appears that the concerned police has visited the accident sport and prepared the observation Mahazar and Rough sketch and after due investigation the final report is filed vide Ex.P5 as against R1. 15.Further on perusal of Ex.P6 it appears that on 3.03.2015 the deceased had died without responding to treatment and on the same day the post mortem was completed and death certificate was also issued vide Ex.P7. Further on perusal of Ex.P4 the MVI report it appears that the fitness certificate was issued for the offending vehicle and it got expired on 11.02.2015, 1 ½ month before the accident and on perusal of Ex.P4 it appears that the 1st respondent owner cum driver was in possession of valid license up to 24.10.2016. On further perusal of Ex.P4 the Motor vehicle inspector he has given the details regarding the damage to the vehicle driven by the 1st Respondent which goes to show that the offending vehicle was driven in a rash and negligent manner and was capsized due to the sudden accident. Further perusal of Ex.P4 it appears that the Inspector has categorically mentioned that the damaged vehicle could not be taken for road test due to the severe damages. Though no eye witness was examined on behalf of the petitioners, the damages sustained by the offending vehicle would go to show that R1 has lost control over the vehicle and dashed against a pedestrian and he also sustained grievous injuries all over his body. As against 1st respondent the Lalapettai P.S. has registered a case for the offences u/s.279, 337 and 304(A) IPC in Cr.No.78/2015 dated 30.03.2015. 16.Therefore, considering the above this court is of the considered view that R1 has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner causing the death of the deceased Manivannan. Though due notice was sent to the 1st Respondent he remained 8 absent and was set ex-parte. Hence as there is no contra evidence available in respect of point No.1 it is answered against the 1st Respondent. POINT Nos.2 to 4 :- Who is liable to pay compensation ? Whether the petitioner is entitled for compensation ? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioner? 17.The case of the petitioner is that due to the sudden demise of the deceased Manivannan, all the petitioners are under great mental shock and agony and they are severely facing financial constraints since, the deceased is the sold bread winner of the entire family who looked after the family very comfortably. Because of the cruel accident their imagination and expectation where shattered. 18.Further case of the petitioners is that the 1st respondent who is the owner cum driver of the offending vehicle Tata Indica Car bearing Registration No.TN 37AT 5775 he is solely liable for the said accident because of his rash and negligent driving. As against 1st respondent the Lalapettai P.S. has registered a case for the offences u/s.279, 337 and 304(A) IPC in Cr.No.78/2015 dated 30.03.2015. 19.Further case of the petitioners is that the deceased was active hale and healthy and met with the accident at his young age of 28 years. But for the accident, he could have lived in good health till 65 to 75 years of age in standard life span. At her young age the 1st petitioner has lost her spouse and the 2nd petitioner who was 3 months old at the time of accident had lost his lovable father. Similarly Petitioners 3 & 4 the parents of the deceased Manivannan have lost their lovable and carrying son. 20.Further case of the petitioners is that though no quantum of compensation would help the petitioners to get back the deceased Manivannan alive but for the sake of social justice and for livelihood of petitioners in the materialistic world the 9 compensation is preferred under relevant heads which are restricted to Rs.20 Lakh which is just fair and reasonable amount. 21.This court has given its anxious consideration to the plea of the Petitioners. Though notice was served upon the 2nd Respondent it remained absent and was set ex-parte. 22.Hence the 1st respondent who is the driver cum owner of the offending vehicle Tata Indica Car bearing Registration No. TN 37AT 5775 and the 2nd respondent who is the insurer of the above said vehicle are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation as claimed by the petitioners. 23.On perusal of the Ex.P8 and Ex.P10 it appears that the 1st petitioner is wife of the deceased, the 2nd petitioner is their only minor son and petitioners 3 & 4 are the parents of the deceased Manivannan. Therefore, this court is of the considered view that as there is no contra evident available as against the above this court is of the considered view that the petitioners alone are the dependents of the deceased Manivannan. 24.Further the 1st Petitioner has lost her husband at the young age. Hence with regard to the claim of consortium the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case between Rajesh and Others Vs Rajbir Singh reported in 2013 ACJ 1403 had held that the wife is entitled for consortium to the extent of Rs.1,00,000/-. For better appreciation the relevant paragraph is reproduced below for better understanding. “20. We may therefore, revisit the practice of awarding compensation under conventional heads, Loss of Consortium to the spouse, Loss of Love, care and guidance to children and Funeral Expenses. It may be noted that the sum of Rs.2,500/- to Rs.10,000/- in those heads was fixed several decades ago and having regard to inflation factor, the some needs to be increased. In Sarla Varma's case (supra), it was held that Compensation for Loss of Consortium should be in the range 10 of Rs.5,000/- to Rs.10,000/- In legal parlance, 'consortium' is the right of the spouse to the Company, care, help, comfort, guidance, society, solace, affection and sexual relations with his or her mate. That non-pecuniary head of damages has not been properly understood by our Courts. The Loss of Companionship, Love, Care and Protection, etc., the spouse is entitled to get, has to be compensated appropriately. The Concept of Non-Pecuniary Damage for Loss of Consortium' is one of the major head of award of Compensation in other parts of the world more particularly in the United States of America, Australia, etc., English Courts have also recognized the right of a spouse to get Compensation even during the period of temporary disablement. By Loss of Consortium, the Courts have made an attempt to compensate the loss of spouse's affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations during the future years. Unlike the Compensation awarded in other countries and other jurisdictions, since the Legal Heirs are otherwise adequately compensated for the Pecuniary Loss, it would not be proper to award a major amount under the head. Hence, we are of the view that it would only be just and reasonable that the Courts award at least rupees one lakh for Loss of Consortium”. 25.Therefore in view of the law laid down by the Hon’ble Apex Court Loss of consortium to the 1st Petitioner in this case is fixed as Rs. 1,00,000/-. 26.Now coming to the income of the deceased the petitioner have examined PW-2 the representative of the employer of the deceased Manivannan who would depose that deceased Manivannan was employed as Machine Shop Drilling Operator. In support of his deposition he also filed the attendance register and wages register to prove that deceased Manivannan was employed at BHARANI HYDRAULICS INDIA PRIV ATE LTD as Machine Shop Drilling Operator, 11 27.On perusal of Ex.P21 the Wages Register during the month of March 2013 the deceased Manivannan was earning a sum of Rs.7,940/- per month. On perusal of Ex.P22 the salary receipt for the moth December 2013 it appears that the deceased was earning a gross sum of Rs.10,392/-. Therefore, taking into consideration of Ex.P19 to Ex.P22 this court is of the considered view that deceased Manivannan was earning a sum of Rs.10,392/- during December 2014. As there is no contra evidence available as against the employment and of the monthly income of the deceased this court fixes the income of the deceased as follows ; 28.Monthly Income of the deceased is Rs.10,392/- Rounded off to Rs.10,400/- and as the deceased was aged about 28 years at the time of accident and was earning a monthly sum of Rs.10,392/-, 50% of his monthly salary is taken as future prospectus. 29.Age of the deceased is fixed as 28 years. hence the Multiplier applicable to this case is 17. Monthly income of deceased is Rs. 10,400/- and Multiplier is 17, future prospectus of 50% comes to Rs.5,200/- . Hence the total income comes to a sum of Rs.15,600/-and as there are four dependents Personal expenses to be deducted is ¼ from his income. i)As such Loss of earnings as follows; Rs.15,600 X 12 X 17 = Rs.31,82,400/- ii)Personal expenses of the deceased as follows; Loss of earnings deduction of out of a sum of [Rs.31,82,400/- divided ¼ ] comes to Rs .7,95,600/-. iii)Hence the loss of income of the deceased as follows ; Loss of earnings minus Personal expenses [Rs.31,82,400/- - Rs.7,95,600/-] comes to Rs.23,86,800/-. 12 Sl.No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs. 23,86,000/- 2 Funeral Expenses Rs. 5,000/- 3 Love and Affection ( 2nd petitioner ) Rs. 1,00,000/- 4 Loss of consortium ( 1st Petitioner ) Rs. 1,00,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs. 25,91,800/- 30. From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled for a sum of Rs.25,91,000/- towards compensation. The 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.7,91,800/- of claim amount and the minor 2nd petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- of claim amount and the petitioners 3 & 4 are entitled for a sum of Rs.4,00,000/- each. Hence, the Point Nos.2 to 4 are answered accordingly. In the result , the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.25,91,800/- with interest to the petitioners at the rate of 9% per annum, from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.7,91,800/- with interest, and the minor 2nd petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.10,00,000/- with interest and the 3rd and 4th Petitioners are entitled for a sum of Rs.4,00,000/- each with interest.

The court fee of Rs.25,290.50- is ordered to be paid by the petitioners within 15 days. The Advocate fee is fixed at Rs.32,918/- to be paid by the Respondents by a separate cheque.

A VERMENTS CONTAINED IN THE COUNTER STATMENT FILED BY 3 rd RESPONDENT :- The application without impleading the owner, driver and insurer of the vehicle bearing Registration No.TN 36 AX 731 alleged to have been involved in the said accident is liable to be dismissed for non-joinder of proper and necessary parties. ii.The accident occurred on 02.10.2015 at about 14.30 hours, at Puliampatti to Irumburai Road, arose due to the rash and negeligent driving of the Lorry bearing Registration No.TN 39 By 7675 is not admitted by the 3rd respondent.

The petitioner must prove that she is the dependant of the deceased. 4 v)The 3rd respondent is not liable to compensate the petitioners, if the insured has violated any of the policy conditions as contemplated in the policy. 5. POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the 1st respondent has drove the Lorry bearing Registration No.TN 39 BY 7675, on 02.10.2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation ? 3.Whether the petitioner is entitled for compensation ? 4. If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 6.On behalf of the petitioners, the 1st petitioner was examined as PW-1 and Vasudevan was examined as PW-2 and 16 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P16. On behalf of the 3rd respondent. Dr.Amsaveni, Assistant Surgeon, G.H., Annur, was examined as RW-1 and 3 documents were marked as Ex.X1 to Ex.X3. POINT No.1:- Whether the 1st respondent has drove the Lorry bearing Registration No.TN 39 BY 7675, on 02.10.2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 7.The case of the petitioner is that on 02.10.2015 at about 02.30 P.M. PW-2 Vasudevan was riding his two-wheeler bearing Registration No.TN 36 AX 0731 in with the deceased was riding as pillion rider. When they were proceeding at Koundenpalayam Bus stop the Lorry bearing Registration No.TN 39 BY 7675 driven by the 1st respondent owned by 2nd respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler driven by PW-1 due to the said negligent act of the 1st respondent the pillion rider deceased Balasubramaniam sustained severe head injuries and died in the spot itself. 8.Though notice was served upon to the driver and owner of the offending vehicle, both of them remained absent and were set exparte on 29.07.2016. 5 9.However the case of the 3rd respondent is that the owner of the vehicle in which the deceased Balasubramanuiam was riding as pillion rider was not arrayed as a party in this application and hence, the claim application is hit by non-joinder of proper and necessary party. Further case of the 3rd respondent is that the driver of the vehicle (PW-1) in which the deceased Balsubramani was riding as pillion alone drove his two wheeler in a Rash and negligent manner under the influence of Alcohol and dashed against the lorry driven by 1st respondent. Hence, PW-1 alone is solely responsible for the alleged accident. 10.In support of the case of 3rd respondent Dr.Amsaveni attached to Government Hospital, Annur. She would depose that on 02.10.2015 she examined PW-1 Vasudevan and from his breath she could find that he was under the influence of Alcohol and through this witness Ex.X3 was marked. On perusal of Ex.X3 which is admittedly a photocopy, and there is no explanation about the non filing of the original document. There is an endorsement stating that “breath smell of Alcohol” . However, it is not clear whether that endorsement was made by RW-1 or some other person. When she was confronted in respect of the above she feigns ignorance of the same. 11.Though the 3rd Respondent would contend that under the influence of alcohol PW-1 alone drove his two wheeler in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the Lorry driven by the 1st Respondent it is not reflected in the M.V .I.Report Ex.P5. Therefore, based on Ex.X3 and Ex.P5 contributory negligence cannot be attributed on the part of PW-1 of the deceased. 12.Further on perusal of Ex.P2 First Information Report dated 02.10.2015 registered against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s.279, 337, 304(A) IPC and Ex.P3 the rough sketch and Ex.P4 the final report laid against the 1st respondent it appears that the petitioner has amply proved that the 1st respondent has driven the 6 Lorry bearing Registration No. TN 39 BY 7675 in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the vehicle driven by PW-1 in which the deceased Balasubramaniam was riding as a pillion rider and caused his death. Hence, 1st respondent who is the driver of vehicle is responsible for the alleged accident. Hence, Point No.1 is answered accordingly. POINT No.2 :- Who is liable to pay compensation ? 13.Admittedly the 1st respondent and 2nd respondent are the driver and owner of the Lorry bearing Registration No. TN 39 BY 7675 and the 3rd respondent is the insurer of the said vehicle. As point No.1 is answered in favour of the petitioner, the respondents 1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the petitioner. POINT No.3 :- Whether the petitioner is entitled for compensation ? 14.The case of the petitioner is that she is the mother of deceased Balasubramaniam and on perusal of Ex.P8 it is the death certificate of the deceased and Ex.P10 Legal heir certificate it is evident that the petitioner is the only legal heir of the deceased Balasubramaniam. As there is no contra evidence available in this respect the petitioner alone is entitled for compensation. Hence, Point No.3 is answered accordingly. POINT No.4 :- If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioner? 15.Now coming to the quantum of compensation t he object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal 7 representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or dependent of the deceased. The compensation should commensurate to the loss of dependency suffered by the legal representatives. Therefore it should be just and reasonable, proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 16.In a given case, if the claim made is so exorbitant or if the claim made is contrary to ground realities, the Tribunal may not accept the claim and may proceed to determine the possible income by resorting to some guess work, which may include the ground realities prevailing at the relevant point of time. It depends on the facts of each case. 17.The case of the petitioner is that the deceased Balasubramaniam was working as a Tailor on contract basis and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- per month. However, there is absolutely no evidence to show that the deceased was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- per month. Further, on perusal of Ex.P9 Post mortem Certificate which is marked with the objection of 3rd respondent, the doctor has opined that the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries and its complications and no adverse remarks is name by the doctor. 18.The case of the petitioner is that at the time of the death of deceased Balasubramaniam was aged about 29 years and in support of her case, School Transfer Certificate is marked as Ex.P14. Further on perusal of the death certificate it is stated that age of the deceased is 29 and in Ex.P9 the age of the deceased is mentioned as 29 years. Therefore considering the materials available on hand the age of the deceased is fixed as 29. 19.Further as the deceased died unmarried as per Sarala Varma case, 50% of the monthly income is to be deducted as personal expenditure and multiplier is 17. 8 20.Now coming to the alleged income of decased Balasubramaniam, the case of the petitioner the deceased was working a Tailor on contract basis and was earning a sum, of Rs.15,000/- However no oral as well as documentary evidence was adduced to prove her contention.; Even no iota of evidence is adduced to show that he was a Tailor by profession. Therefore as per the direction of Hon'ble Apex Court notional income of the deceased is fixed as Rs.7,000/- . And as the deceased was aged about 29, half of the monthly income is to be added to calculate the loss of future prospectus. Hence, F uture prospectus of the deceased comes to [Rs.7,000 + Rs.3,500] Rs.10,500/- . 21.Loss of income is calculated as below ; Rs.10,500 x 12 x 17 = Rs.21,42,000/- and 50% deduction of personal expenses comes to Rs.10,71,000/- . Hence, Loss of income is comes to [Rs.21,42,000 – Rs.10,71,000] = Rs.10,71,000/-. Sl.No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs. 10,71,000/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs. 1,00,000/- 3 Funeral Expenses Rs. 10,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs. 11,81,000/- 22. From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.11,81,000/- towards compensation. The Petitioner is entitled for Rs.11,81,000/- of claim amount. Hence, the Point No.4 is answered accordingly. 9 In the result, the Respondents 1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay a compensation of Rs.11,81,000/- with interest to the petitioner at the rate of 9% per annum, from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. After deposit, the petitioner is permitted to withdraw her entire share amount with interest immediately. The court fee of Rs.11,182.50- is ordered to be paid by the petitioner within 15 days.

Further case of the 3rd respondent is that the driver of the vehicle (PW-1) in which the deceased Balsubramani was riding as pillion alone drove his two wheeler in a Rash and negligent manner under the influence of Alcohol and dashed against the lorry driven by 1st respondent. Hence, PW-1 alone is solely responsible for the alleged accident. 10.In support of the case of 3rd respondent Dr.Amsaveni attached to Government Hospital, Annur. She would depose that on 02.10.2015 she examined PW-1 Vasudevan and from his breath she could find that he was under the influence of Alcohol and through this witness Ex.X3 was marked. On perusal of Ex.X3 which is admittedly a photocopy, and there is no explanation about the non filing of the original document. There is an endorsement stating that “breath smell of Alcohol” . However, it is not clear whether that endorsement was made by RW-1 or some other person. When she was confronted in respect of the above she feigns ignorance of the same. 11.Though the 3rd Respondent would contend that under the influence of alcohol PW-1 alone drove his two wheeler in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the Lorry driven by the 1st Respondent it is not reflected in the M.V .I.Report Ex.P5. Therefore, based on Ex.X3 and Ex.P5 contributory negligence cannot be attributed on the part of PW-1 of the deceased. 12.Further on perusal of Ex.P2 First Information Report dated 02.10.2015 registered against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s.279, 337, 304(A) IPC and Ex.P3 the rough sketch and Ex.P4 the final report laid against the 1st respondent it appears that the petitioner has amply proved that the 1st respondent has driven the 6 Lorry bearing Registration No. TN 39 BY 7675 in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the vehicle driven by PW-1 in which the deceased Balasubramaniam was riding as a pillion rider and caused his death. Hence, 1st respondent who is the driver of vehicle is responsible for the alleged accident. Hence, Point No.1 is answered accordingly. POINT No.2 :- Who is liable to pay compensation ? 13.Admittedly the 1st respondent and 2nd respondent are the driver and owner of the Lorry bearing Registration No. TN 39 BY 7675 and the 3rd respondent is the insurer of the said vehicle. As point No.1 is answered in favour of the petitioner, the respondents 1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the petitioner. POINT No.3 :- Whether the petitioner is entitled for compensation ? 14.The case of the petitioner is that she is the mother of deceased Balasubramaniam and on perusal of Ex.P8 it is the death certificate of the deceased and Ex.P10 Legal heir certificate it is evident that the petitioner is the only legal heir of the deceased Balasubramaniam. As there is no contra evidence available in this respect the petitioner alone is entitled for compensation. Hence, Point No.3 is answered accordingly. POINT No.4 :- If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioner? 15.Now coming to the quantum of compensation t he object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal 7 representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or dependent of the deceased. The compensation should commensurate to the loss of dependency suffered by the legal representatives. Therefore it should be just and reasonable, proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 16.In a given case, if the claim made is so exorbitant or if the claim made is contrary to ground realities, the Tribunal may not accept the claim and may proceed to determine the possible income by resorting to some guess work, which may include the ground realities prevailing at the relevant point of time. It depends on the facts of each case. 17.The case of the petitioner is that the deceased Balasubramaniam was working as a Tailor on contract basis and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- per month. However, there is absolutely no evidence to show that the deceased was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- per month. Further, on perusal of Ex.P9 Post mortem Certificate which is marked with the objection of 3rd respondent, the doctor has opined that the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries and its complications and no adverse remarks is name by the doctor. 18.The case of the petitioner is that at the time of the death of deceased Balasubramaniam was aged about 29 years and in support of her case, School Transfer Certificate is marked as Ex.P14. Further on perusal of the death certificate it is stated that age of the deceased is 29 and in Ex.P9 the age of the deceased is mentioned as 29 years. Therefore considering the materials available on hand the age of the deceased is fixed as 29. 19.Further as the deceased died unmarried as per Sarala Varma case, 50% of the monthly income is to be deducted as personal expenditure and multiplier is 17. 8 20.Now coming to the alleged income of decased Balasubramaniam, the case of the petitioner the deceased was working a Tailor on contract basis and was earning a sum, of Rs.15,000/- However no oral as well as documentary evidence was adduced to prove her contention.; Even no iota of evidence is adduced to show that he was a Tailor by profession. Therefore as per the direction of Hon'ble Apex Court notional income of the deceased is fixed as Rs.7,000/- . And as the deceased was aged about 29, half of the monthly income is to be added to calculate the loss of future prospectus. Hence, F uture prospectus of the deceased comes to [Rs.7,000 + Rs.3,500] Rs.10,500/- . 21.Loss of income is calculated as below ; Rs.10,500 x 12 x 17 = Rs.21,42,000/- and 50% deduction of personal expenses comes to Rs.10,71,000/- . Hence, Loss of income is comes to [Rs.21,42,000 – Rs.10,71,000] = Rs.10,71,000/-. Sl.No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs. 10,71,000/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs. 1,00,000/- 3 Funeral Expenses Rs. 10,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs. 11,81,000/- 22. From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.11,81,000/- towards compensation. The Petitioner is entitled for Rs.11,81,000/- of claim amount. Hence, the Point No.4 is answered accordingly. 9 In the result, the Respondents 1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay a compensation of Rs.11,81,000/- with interest to the petitioner at the rate of 9% per annum, from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. After deposit, the petitioner is permitted to withdraw her entire share amount with interest immediately. The court fee of Rs.11,182.50- is ordered to be paid by the petitioner within 15 days. The Advocate fee is fixed at Rs.18,810/- to be paid by the Respondents by a separate cheque.

POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the 1st respondent has drove the Lorry bearing Registration No.TN 39 BY 7675, on 02.10.2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation ? 3.Whether the petitioner is entitled for compensation ? 4. If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 6.On behalf of the petitioners, the 1st petitioner was examined as PW-1 and Vasudevan was examined as PW-2 and 16 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P16. On behalf of the 3rd respondent. Dr.Amsaveni, Assistant Surgeon, G.H., Annur, was examined as RW-1 and 3 documents were marked as Ex.X1 to Ex.X3. POINT No.1:- Whether the 1st respondent has drove the Lorry bearing Registration No.TN 39 BY 7675, on 02.10.2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 7.The case of the petitioner is that on 02.10.2015 at about 02.30 P.M. PW-2 Vasudevan was riding his two-wheeler bearing Registration No.TN 36 AX 0731 in with the deceased was riding as pillion rider. When they were proceeding at Koundenpalayam Bus stop the Lorry bearing Registration No.TN 39 BY 7675 driven by the 1st respondent owned by 2nd respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler driven by PW-1 due to the said negligent act of the 1st respondent the pillion rider deceased Balasubramaniam sustained severe head injuries and died in the spot itself. 8.Though notice was served upon to the driver and owner of the offending vehicle, both of them remained absent and were set exparte on 29.07.2016. 5 9.However the case of the 3rd respondent is that the owner of the vehicle in which the deceased Balasubramanuiam was riding as pillion rider was not arrayed as a party in this application and hence, the claim application is hit by non-joinder of proper and necessary party. Further case of the 3rd respondent is that the driver of the vehicle (PW-1) in which the deceased Balsubramani was riding as pillion alone drove his two wheeler in a Rash and negligent manner under the influence of Alcohol and dashed against the lorry driven by 1st respondent. Hence, PW-1 alone is solely responsible for the alleged accident. 10.In support of the case of 3rd respondent Dr.Amsaveni attached to Government Hospital, Annur. She would depose that on 02.10.2015 she examined PW-1 Vasudevan and from his breath she could find that he was under the influence of Alcohol and through this witness Ex.X3 was marked. On perusal of Ex.X3 which is admittedly a photocopy, and there is no explanation about the non filing of the original document. There is an endorsement stating that “breath smell of Alcohol” . However, it is not clear whether that endorsement was made by RW-1 or some other person. When she was confronted in respect of the above she feigns ignorance of the same. 11.Though the 3rd Respondent would contend that under the influence of alcohol PW-1 alone drove his two wheeler in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the Lorry driven by the 1st Respondent it is not reflected in the M.V .I.Report Ex.P5. Therefore, based on Ex.X3 and Ex.P5 contributory negligence cannot be attributed on the part of PW-1 of the deceased. 12.Further on perusal of Ex.P2 First Information Report dated 02.10.2015 registered against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s.279, 337, 304(A) IPC and Ex.P3 the rough sketch and Ex.P4 the final report laid against the 1st respondent it appears that the petitioner has amply proved that the 1st respondent has driven the 6 Lorry bearing Registration No. TN 39 BY 7675 in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the vehicle driven by PW-1 in which the deceased Balasubramaniam was riding as a pillion rider and caused his death. Hence, 1st respondent who is the driver of vehicle is responsible for the alleged accident. Hence, Point No.1 is answered accordingly. POINT No.2 :- Who is liable to pay compensation ? 13.Admittedly the 1st respondent and 2nd respondent are the driver and owner of the Lorry bearing Registration No. TN 39 BY 7675 and the 3rd respondent is the insurer of the said vehicle. As point No.1 is answered in favour of the petitioner, the respondents 1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the petitioner. POINT No.3 :- Whether the petitioner is entitled for compensation ? 14.The case of the petitioner is that she is the mother of deceased Balasubramaniam and on perusal of Ex.P8 it is the death certificate of the deceased and Ex.P10 Legal heir certificate it is evident that the petitioner is the only legal heir of the deceased Balasubramaniam. As there is no contra evidence available in this respect the petitioner alone is entitled for compensation. Hence, Point No.3 is answered accordingly. POINT No.4 :- If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioner? 15.Now coming to the quantum of compensation t he object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal 7 representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or dependent of the deceased. The compensation should commensurate to the loss of dependency suffered by the legal representatives. Therefore it should be just and reasonable, proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 16.In a given case, if the claim made is so exorbitant or if the claim made is contrary to ground realities, the Tribunal may not accept the claim and may proceed to determine the possible income by resorting to some guess work, which may include the ground realities prevailing at the relevant point of time. It depends on the facts of each case. 17.The case of the petitioner is that the deceased Balasubramaniam was working as a Tailor on contract basis and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- per month. However, there is absolutely no evidence to show that the deceased was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- per month. Further, on perusal of Ex.P9 Post mortem Certificate which is marked with the objection of 3rd respondent, the doctor has opined that the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries and its complications and no adverse remarks is name by the doctor. 18.The case of the petitioner is that at the time of the death of deceased Balasubramaniam was aged about 29 years and in support of her case, School Transfer Certificate is marked as Ex.P14. Further on perusal of the death certificate it is stated that age of the deceased is 29 and in Ex.P9 the age of the deceased is mentioned as 29 years. Therefore considering the materials available on hand the age of the deceased is fixed as 29. 19.Further as the deceased died unmarried as per Sarala Varma case, 50% of the monthly income is to be deducted as personal expenditure and multiplier is 17. 8 20.Now coming to the alleged income of decased Balasubramaniam, the case of the petitioner the deceased was working a Tailor on contract basis and was earning a sum, of Rs.15,000/- However no oral as well as documentary evidence was adduced to prove her contention.; Even no iota of evidence is adduced to show that he was a Tailor by profession. Therefore as per the direction of Hon'ble Apex Court notional income of the deceased is fixed as Rs.7,000/- . And as the deceased was aged about 29, half of the monthly income is to be added to calculate the loss of future prospectus. Hence, F uture prospectus of the deceased comes to [Rs.7,000 + Rs.3,500] Rs.10,500/- . 21.Loss of income is calculated as below ; Rs.10,500 x 12 x 17 = Rs.21,42,000/- and 50% deduction of personal expenses comes to Rs.10,71,000/- . Hence, Loss of income is comes to [Rs.21,42,000 – Rs.10,71,000] = Rs.10,71,000/-. Sl.No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs. 10,71,000/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs. 1,00,000/- 3 Funeral Expenses Rs. 10,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs. 11,81,000/- 22. From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.11,81,000/- towards compensation. The Petitioner is entitled for Rs.11,81,000/- of claim amount. Hence, the Point No.4 is answered accordingly. 9 In the result, the Respondents 1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay a compensation of Rs.11,81,000/- with interest to the petitioner at the rate of 9% per annum, from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. After deposit, the petitioner is permitted to withdraw her entire share amount with interest immediately. The court fee of Rs.11,182.50- is ordered to be paid by the petitioner within 15 days. The Advocate fee is fixed at Rs.18,810/- to be paid by the Respondents by a separate cheque.

POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the 1st respondent has drove the Lorry bearing Registration No.TN 39 BY 7675, on 02.10.2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation ? 3.Whether the petitioner is entitled for compensation ? 4. If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 6.On behalf of the petitioners, the 1st petitioner was examined as PW-1 and Vasudevan was examined as PW-2 and 16 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P16. On behalf of the 3rd respondent. Dr.Amsaveni, Assistant Surgeon, G.H., Annur, was examined as RW-1 and 3 documents were marked as Ex.X1 to Ex.X3. POINT No.1:- Whether the 1st respondent has drove the Lorry bearing Registration No.TN 39 BY 7675, on 02.10.2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 7.The case of the petitioner is that on 02.10.2015 at about 02.30 P.M. PW-2 Vasudevan was riding his two-wheeler bearing Registration No.TN 36 AX 0731 in with the deceased was riding as pillion rider. When they were proceeding at Koundenpalayam Bus stop the Lorry bearing Registration No.TN 39 BY 7675 driven by the 1st respondent owned by 2nd respondent came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler driven by PW-1 due to the said negligent act of the 1st respondent the pillion rider deceased Balasubramaniam sustained severe head injuries and died in the spot itself. 8.Though notice was served upon to the driver and owner of the offending vehicle, both of them remained absent and were set exparte on 29.07.2016. 5 9.However the case of the 3rd respondent is that the owner of the vehicle in which the deceased Balasubramanuiam was riding as pillion rider was not arrayed as a party in this application and hence, the claim application is hit by non-joinder of proper and necessary party. Further case of the 3rd respondent is that the driver of the vehicle (PW-1) in which the deceased Balsubramani was riding as pillion alone drove his two wheeler in a Rash and negligent manner under the influence of Alcohol and dashed against the lorry driven by 1st respondent. Hence, PW-1 alone is solely responsible for the alleged accident. 10.In support of the case of 3rd respondent Dr.Amsaveni attached to Government Hospital, Annur. She would depose that on 02.10.2015 she examined PW-1 Vasudevan and from his breath she could find that he was under the influence of Alcohol and through this witness Ex.X3 was marked. On perusal of Ex.X3 which is admittedly a photocopy, and there is no explanation about the non filing of the original document. There is an endorsement stating that “breath smell of Alcohol” . However, it is not clear whether that endorsement was made by RW-1 or some other person. When she was confronted in respect of the above she feigns ignorance of the same. 11.Though the 3rd Respondent would contend that under the influence of alcohol PW-1 alone drove his two wheeler in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the Lorry driven by the 1st Respondent it is not reflected in the M.V .I.Report Ex.P5. Therefore, based on Ex.X3 and Ex.P5 contributory negligence cannot be attributed on the part of PW-1 of the deceased. 12.Further on perusal of Ex.P2 First Information Report dated 02.10.2015 registered against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s.279, 337, 304(A) IPC and Ex.P3 the rough sketch and Ex.P4 the final report laid against the 1st respondent it appears that the petitioner has amply proved that the 1st respondent has driven the 6 Lorry bearing Registration No. TN 39 BY 7675 in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the vehicle driven by PW-1 in which the deceased Balasubramaniam was riding as a pillion rider and caused his death. Hence, 1st respondent who is the driver of vehicle is responsible for the alleged accident. Hence, Point No.1 is answered accordingly. POINT No.2 :- Who is liable to pay compensation ? 13.Admittedly the 1st respondent and 2nd respondent are the driver and owner of the Lorry bearing Registration No. TN 39 BY 7675 and the 3rd respondent is the insurer of the said vehicle. As point No.1 is answered in favour of the petitioner, the respondents 1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the petitioner. POINT No.3 :- Whether the petitioner is entitled for compensation ? 14.The case of the petitioner is that she is the mother of deceased Balasubramaniam and on perusal of Ex.P8 it is the death certificate of the deceased and Ex.P10 Legal heir certificate it is evident that the petitioner is the only legal heir of the deceased Balasubramaniam. As there is no contra evidence available in this respect the petitioner alone is entitled for compensation. Hence, Point No.3 is answered accordingly. POINT No.4 :- If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioner? 15.Now coming to the quantum of compensation t he object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal 7 representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or dependent of the deceased. The compensation should commensurate to the loss of dependency suffered by the legal representatives. Therefore it should be just and reasonable, proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 16.In a given case, if the claim made is so exorbitant or if the claim made is contrary to ground realities, the Tribunal may not accept the claim and may proceed to determine the possible income by resorting to some guess work, which may include the ground realities prevailing at the relevant point of time. It depends on the facts of each case. 17.The case of the petitioner is that the deceased Balasubramaniam was working as a Tailor on contract basis and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- per month. However, there is absolutely no evidence to show that the deceased was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- per month. Further, on perusal of Ex.P9 Post mortem Certificate which is marked with the objection of 3rd respondent, the doctor has opined that the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries and its complications and no adverse remarks is name by the doctor. 18.The case of the petitioner is that at the time of the death of deceased Balasubramaniam was aged about 29 years and in support of her case, School Transfer Certificate is marked as Ex.P14. Further on perusal of the death certificate it is stated that age of the deceased is 29 and in Ex.P9 the age of the deceased is mentioned as 29 years. Therefore considering the materials available on hand the age of the deceased is fixed as 29. 19.Further as the deceased died unmarried as per Sarala Varma case, 50% of the monthly income is to be deducted as personal expenditure and multiplier is 17. 8 20.Now coming to the alleged income of decased Balasubramaniam, the case of the petitioner the deceased was working a Tailor on contract basis and was earning a sum, of Rs.15,000/- However no oral as well as documentary evidence was adduced to prove her contention.; Even no iota of evidence is adduced to show that he was a Tailor by profession. Therefore as per the direction of Hon'ble Apex Court notional income of the deceased is fixed as Rs.7,000/- . And as the deceased was aged about 29, half of the monthly income is to be added to calculate the loss of future prospectus. Hence, F uture prospectus of the deceased comes to [Rs.7,000 + Rs.3,500] Rs.10,500/- . 21.Loss of income is calculated as below ; Rs.10,500 x 12 x 17 = Rs.21,42,000/- and 50% deduction of personal expenses comes to Rs.10,71,000/- . Hence, Loss of income is comes to [Rs.21,42,000 – Rs.10,71,000] = Rs.10,71,000/-. Sl.No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs. 10,71,000/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs. 1,00,000/- 3 Funeral Expenses Rs. 10,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs. 11,81,000/- 22. From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.11,81,000/- towards compensation. The Petitioner is entitled for Rs.11,81,000/- of claim amount. Hence, the Point No.4 is answered accordingly. 9 In the result, the Respondents 1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay a compensation of Rs.11,81,000/- with interest to the petitioner at the rate of 9% per annum, from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. After deposit, the petitioner is permitted to withdraw her entire share amount with interest immediately. The court fee of Rs.11,182.50- is ordered to be paid by the petitioner within 15 days. The Advocate fee is fixed at Rs.18,810/- to be paid by the Respondents by a separate cheque.

The allegations that the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent is false. The deceased was the root cause of the alleged accident and he drove the vehicle No: TN 38-Y-3530 and dashed against the 1st respondent vehicle. The alleged accident took place in the middle of the road by the rash and negligence of the deceased. The cause and mode of the alleged accident are denied and the petitioners are put to strict proof of the same with documentary evidence.

POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle Hero Honda Pleasure bearing its Registration No. TN 38 BS 7938 on 30-08-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 4. If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 5.On behalf of the petitioner, the petitioner was examined as PW-1, and one Dinesh Kumar was examined as PW-2, and one Karthikeyan was examined as PW-3, and 17 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P17. On behalf of the defendants no witness has been examined and no documents were marked. On behalf of the witness 3 documents were marked as Ex.X1 to Ex.X3. 7 POINT No.1: Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle Hero Honda Pleasure bearing its Registration No. TN 38 BS 7938 on 30-08-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 6.The case of the petitioner is that on 30-08-2015 the deceased Selvaraj was riding in his two wheeler bearing registration No. TN 38 Y 3530 in the Coimbatore to Sakthi Main road. Further case of the petitioner is that on that day the deceased was proceeding to his company JEM Pattern Works and on the way when he turned to his right after proper indication and sound however all of a sudden the two wheeler bearing registration NO. TN 38 BS 7938 dashed against the deceased vehicle who came in a rash and negligent manner. Due to the said accident the deceased was thrown away on the road and sustained multiple injuries all over his body. Further case of the petitioners is that the 1st respondent is the driver cum owner of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the insurer of the offending vehicle. Hence as the accident had occurred due to the rash and negligent act of the 1st respondent both the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 7.Whereas the contention of the 2nd respondent is that the rider of the offending vehicle was not holding in a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the alleged accident. Hence there is a violation of the conditions of policy. Further they would contend that as the conditions in the policy is violated the insurance company is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 8.Further contentions of the 2nd respondent is that they denied the place, date, time and mode of the alleged accident. Further it is also equally false to allege that it is the first respondent who has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. As a matter of fact it is the deceased who was the root cause of the alleged accident since the accident took place in the middle of the road. 9.This Court as given its anxious consideration on the rival contentions of both the parties. On perusal of Ex.P1 F.I.R it reveals that a case is registered as against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s 279 and 304 (A) I.P.C. On perusal of Ex.P2 rough sketch the place of accident is shown. Further on perusal of Ex.P3 M.V . Report in respect of vehicle driven by the 1st respondent it reveals that the 1st respondent was in possession of a valid driving license and the said vehicle is insured under R2. Hence the contention of the 2nd respondent is that the driver of the offending 8 vehicle drove his vehicle without a valid driving licence false to the ground. Further on perusal of Ex.P4 it reveals that the concerned Police has laid his final report as against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s 279 and 304 (A) I.P.C. Further on perusal of Ex.P5 Post mortem certificate the Doctor has opined that the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries and no adverse remarks is mentioned against the deceased. Further the petitioners have also examined PW2 Dinesh Kumar who is the eye witness to the accident. In the chief examination he has categorically deposed that the 1st respondent has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the vehicle of the deceased. Though the PW-2 was elaborately cross examined nothing was able to extract in support of their contention. 10.Therefore taking into consideration of the available materials in hand this court is of the considered view that the petitioner have prima facie established that the 1st respondent alone has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident due to which the deceased died. Hence Point NO 1 is answered against the 1st respondent. POINT NO. 2: Who is liable to pay compensation? 11.Admittedly the 1st respondent is the driver -cum owner of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the insurer and as Point NO. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 12.The case of the petitioner is that the 1st petitioner is the wife of the deceased 2nd and 3rd petitioners are the daughters of the deceased and the 4th and 5th petitioners are the parents of the deceased Selvaraj. 13.Further case of the petitioners is that at the time of accident deceased Selvaraj was aged about 48 years, and he was hale ad healthy at the time of accident and he was working 9 in the Jem Patter works as a turner and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- per month and he also used to get a sum of Rs.5,000/- as extra wages by doing over time. Further case of the petitioners is that the deceased Selvaraj is the only bread winner of the family, and but for the accident he would have lived a long life. 14. Whereas the contention of the 2nd respondent is that it is false to allege that he was getting a sum of Rs.20,000/- p.m and the petitioners are depending upon the income of the deceased Selvaraj, The 2nd respondent would further contend that the claim amount is exorbitant and not sustainable in the eye of law. 15.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or the dependents of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 16.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may proceed to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 17.In order to prove that the deceased was employed and was considerably earning they examined P.W3 Karthiheyan who would depose that the deceased Selvaraj was working in his concern from 2013 onwards and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- of monthly remuneration. However during cross examination he has admitted that though he is running Sree Jem Pattern Works, no attendance register is maintained and his establishment is not registered under E.S.I. and P.F. Act. Further she has also admitted that no monthly salary is paid as such and depending upon 10 the duty the daily cooly is paid to the deceased and in respect of the same no document is maintained by him. On perusal of Ex.X2 it reveals that Srie Jem Works is registered under the Commercial Tax Department and Ex.X3 alleged salary certificate said to have issued by PW3 it is mentioned that the deceased was drawing a consolidated salary of Rs.15,000/- p.m. Further on perusal of Ex.P6 death certificate, It is admitted fact that deceased is died of road accident and Ex.P7 it reveals that the petitioners are the legal heirs of deceased Selvaraj, 18.On analyzing the materials in hand though P.W.3 would deposed that the deceased was employed at his establishment no material evidence is produced before this Court to prove the same. Though Ex.X2, X3 are marked the evidence of PW3 does not inspire the confidence of this Court. Hence considering the age of the deceased as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court Notional income of the deceased is taken into consideration to calculate the compensation. 19.As per the case of the petitioners the age of the deceased is 48 whereas in the post mortem certificate and in the death certificate the age of the deceased is mentioned as 51 Though the petitioners would alleged that deceased Selvaraj is aged about 48 no document evidence is produced to show that at the time of accident the deceased was aged about 48. Therefore the age of the deceased is fixed as 51 and a notional income of a sum of Rs.8,000/- is taken into consideration as monthly wages. And as per the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court a Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 11 and as there are 5 dependents 1/4th of the income of the deceased is deducted for his personal expenditure. 20.As per the latest Judgment Reported in 2017 (2) TN MAC 609 (SC) in the case between National Insurance Company Limited … Vs..... Pranay Sethi and others 10% of the income is taken as addition. Hence 10% of the income comes to Rs.800/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.8,000+ Rs.800/- which is comes to Rs.8,800/-. Hence s sum of Rs.8,800 /- is fixed as income of the deceased. 21.And as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 11 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court considering the marital status of the deceased 1/4 of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 11 22.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as the income of the deceased is Rs.8,800/-. Hence Rs.8,800 X 12 X 11 = Rs.11,61,600/- and 1/4th personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.2,90,400/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs. 11,61,600 – Rs.2,90,400 = Rs.8,71,200/- 23. Further as per the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for funeral expenses, and a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for loss of estate, and a sum of Rs.40,000/- was taken for loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner. 24.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.8,71,200/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/- 3 Funeral Expanes Rs. 15,000/- 4 Loss of consortium Rs. 40,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.9,41,200/- From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.19,41,200/- -towards compensation and the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.9,41,200/ -with interest . 25. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.6,41,200/-of claim amount, and the 2nd to 5th petitioners are entitled for each a sum of Rs.75,000/- of claim amount, Hence point Nos.3 & 4 are answered accordingly.

And out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.6,41,200/- of claim amount and the 2nd to 5th Petitioners are entitled for each a sum of Rs.75,000/- of claim amount After deposit, all the petitioners are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount with 12 interest immediately.

POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle Hero Honda Pleasure bearing its Registration No. TN 38 BS 7938 on 30-08-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? 4. If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 5.On behalf of the petitioner, the petitioner was examined as PW-1, and one Dinesh Kumar was examined as PW-2, and one Karthikeyan was examined as PW-3, and 17 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P17. On behalf of the defendants no witness has been examined and no documents were marked. On behalf of the witness 3 documents were marked as Ex.X1 to Ex.X3. 7 POINT No.1: Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle Hero Honda Pleasure bearing its Registration No. TN 38 BS 7938 on 30-08-2015 in a rash and negligent manner? 6.The case of the petitioner is that on 30-08-2015 the deceased Selvaraj was riding in his two wheeler bearing registration No. TN 38 Y 3530 in the Coimbatore to Sakthi Main road. Further case of the petitioner is that on that day the deceased was proceeding to his company JEM Pattern Works and on the way when he turned to his right after proper indication and sound however all of a sudden the two wheeler bearing registration NO. TN 38 BS 7938 dashed against the deceased vehicle who came in a rash and negligent manner. Due to the said accident the deceased was thrown away on the road and sustained multiple injuries all over his body. Further case of the petitioners is that the 1st respondent is the driver cum owner of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the insurer of the offending vehicle. Hence as the accident had occurred due to the rash and negligent act of the 1st respondent both the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 7.Whereas the contention of the 2nd respondent is that the rider of the offending vehicle was not holding in a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the alleged accident. Hence there is a violation of the conditions of policy. Further they would contend that as the conditions in the policy is violated the insurance company is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 8.Further contentions of the 2nd respondent is that they denied the place, date, time and mode of the alleged accident. Further it is also equally false to allege that it is the first respondent who has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. As a matter of fact it is the deceased who was the root cause of the alleged accident since the accident took place in the middle of the road. 9.This Court as given its anxious consideration on the rival contentions of both the parties. On perusal of Ex.P1 F.I.R it reveals that a case is registered as against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s 279 and 304 (A) I.P.C. On perusal of Ex.P2 rough sketch the place of accident is shown. Further on perusal of Ex.P3 M.V . Report in respect of vehicle driven by the 1st respondent it reveals that the 1st respondent was in possession of a valid driving license and the said vehicle is insured under R2. Hence the contention of the 2nd respondent is that the driver of the offending 8 vehicle drove his vehicle without a valid driving licence false to the ground. Further on perusal of Ex.P4 it reveals that the concerned Police has laid his final report as against the 1st respondent for the offences u/s 279 and 304 (A) I.P.C. Further on perusal of Ex.P5 Post mortem certificate the Doctor has opined that the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries and no adverse remarks is mentioned against the deceased. Further the petitioners have also examined PW2 Dinesh Kumar who is the eye witness to the accident. In the chief examination he has categorically deposed that the 1st respondent has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the vehicle of the deceased. Though the PW-2 was elaborately cross examined nothing was able to extract in support of their contention. 10.Therefore taking into consideration of the available materials in hand this court is of the considered view that the petitioner have prima facie established that the 1st respondent alone has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident due to which the deceased died. Hence Point NO 1 is answered against the 1st respondent. POINT NO. 2: Who is liable to pay compensation? 11.Admittedly the 1st respondent is the driver -cum owner of the offending vehicle and the 2nd respondent is the insurer and as Point NO. 1 is answered against the 1st respondent the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. POINT NO. 3 & 4: Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation ? If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners? 12.The case of the petitioner is that the 1st petitioner is the wife of the deceased 2nd and 3rd petitioners are the daughters of the deceased and the 4th and 5th petitioners are the parents of the deceased Selvaraj. 13.Further case of the petitioners is that at the time of accident deceased Selvaraj was aged about 48 years, and he was hale ad healthy at the time of accident and he was working 9 in the Jem Patter works as a turner and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- per month and he also used to get a sum of Rs.5,000/- as extra wages by doing over time. Further case of the petitioners is that the deceased Selvaraj is the only bread winner of the family, and but for the accident he would have lived a long life. 14. Whereas the contention of the 2nd respondent is that it is false to allege that he was getting a sum of Rs.20,000/- p.m and the petitioners are depending upon the income of the deceased Selvaraj, The 2nd respondent would further contend that the claim amount is exorbitant and not sustainable in the eye of law. 15.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives or the dependents of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss of defence suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 16.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may proceed to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 17.In order to prove that the deceased was employed and was considerably earning they examined P.W3 Karthiheyan who would depose that the deceased Selvaraj was working in his concern from 2013 onwards and he was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- of monthly remuneration. However during cross examination he has admitted that though he is running Sree Jem Pattern Works, no attendance register is maintained and his establishment is not registered under E.S.I. and P.F. Act. Further she has also admitted that no monthly salary is paid as such and depending upon 10 the duty the daily cooly is paid to the deceased and in respect of the same no document is maintained by him. On perusal of Ex.X2 it reveals that Srie Jem Works is registered under the Commercial Tax Department and Ex.X3 alleged salary certificate said to have issued by PW3 it is mentioned that the deceased was drawing a consolidated salary of Rs.15,000/- p.m. Further on perusal of Ex.P6 death certificate, It is admitted fact that deceased is died of road accident and Ex.P7 it reveals that the petitioners are the legal heirs of deceased Selvaraj, 18.On analyzing the materials in hand though P.W.3 would deposed that the deceased was employed at his establishment no material evidence is produced before this Court to prove the same. Though Ex.X2, X3 are marked the evidence of PW3 does not inspire the confidence of this Court. Hence considering the age of the deceased as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court Notional income of the deceased is taken into consideration to calculate the compensation. 19.As per the case of the petitioners the age of the deceased is 48 whereas in the post mortem certificate and in the death certificate the age of the deceased is mentioned as 51 Though the petitioners would alleged that deceased Selvaraj is aged about 48 no document evidence is produced to show that at the time of accident the deceased was aged about 48. Therefore the age of the deceased is fixed as 51 and a notional income of a sum of Rs.8,000/- is taken into consideration as monthly wages. And as per the dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court a Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 11 and as there are 5 dependents 1/4th of the income of the deceased is deducted for his personal expenditure. 20.As per the latest Judgment Reported in 2017 (2) TN MAC 609 (SC) in the case between National Insurance Company Limited … Vs..... Pranay Sethi and others 10% of the income is taken as addition. Hence 10% of the income comes to Rs.800/- and the total loss of monthly income is calculated as Rs.8,000+ Rs.800/- which is comes to Rs.8,800/-. Hence s sum of Rs.8,800 /- is fixed as income of the deceased. 21.And as per the law laid down in Sharla Varma Case the appropriate multiplier is 11 and as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Appex Court considering the marital status of the deceased 1/4 of the income of the deceased is taken for personal expenses. 11 22.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as the income of the deceased is Rs.8,800/-. Hence Rs.8,800 X 12 X 11 = Rs.11,61,600/- and 1/4th personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to Rs.2,90,400/-. And the loss of income of the deceased comes to Rs. 11,61,600 – Rs.2,90,400 = Rs.8,71,200/- 23. Further as per the latest judgment of the Hon'ble Appex Court a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for funeral expenses, and a sum of Rs.15,000/- was taken for loss of estate, and a sum of Rs.40,000/- was taken for loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner. 24.Hence in total the loss of income is calculated as follows. Sl. No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.8,71,200/- 2 Loss of Estate Rs. 15,000/- 3 Funeral Expanes Rs. 15,000/- 4 Loss of consortium Rs. 40,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs.9,41,200/- From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.19,41,200/- -towards compensation and the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.9,41,200/ -with interest . 25. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.6,41,200/-of claim amount, and the 2nd to 5th petitioners are entitled for each a sum of Rs.75,000/- of claim amount, Hence point Nos.3 & 4 are answered accordingly. In the result , the Respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.9,41,200/ - with interest to the Petitioners, at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. And out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for Rs.6,41,200/- of claim amount and the 2nd to 5th Petitioners are entitled for each a sum of Rs.75,000/- of claim amount After deposit, all the petitioners are permitted to withdraw their entire share amount with 12 interest immediately.

POINTS FOR CONSIDERATION :- 1.Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle Scorpio Car bearing Registration No.TN 38 R 9218, on 15.05.2010 in a rash and negligent manner? 2.Who is liable to pay compensation? 3.Whether the petitioners are entitled for compensation? 4. If so what is the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioner? 6.On behalf of the petitioners, the 2nd petitioner was examined as PW-1 and one Murugesan was examined as PW-2 and one Satheesh Kumar was examined as PW-3 and 7 documents were marked as Ex.P1 to Ex.P7. On behalf of the 2nd Respondent, no witnesses were examined and no document was marked. POINT No.1:- Whether the 1st respondent has drove the offending vehicle Scorpio Car bearing Registration No.TN 38 R 9218, on 15.05.2010 in a rash and negligent manner? 7.The case of the petitioners is that on 15.05.2010 the deceased Ramasamy Gounder was resting under the shadow of a coconut tree and was cattle breeding near Rangasamuthiram Pirivu on K.G.Chavadi to Velanthavanam Road. During that time at about 12.00 noon the Scorpio Car bearing Registration No. TN 38 R 9218 driven by one Krishnakumar, the 1st respondent herein, came swiftly from South to North direction in a rash and negligent manner without adhering the rules and regulations in a zig zag manner and hit Rangasamy Gounder in an unexpected manner. As a result of which Rangasmay Gounder succumbed with multiple body injuries. Immediately he was shifted to Coimbatore Medical College Hospital where he was declared as dead. 8.Whereas the contention of the 2nd respondent is that he deny the manner of accident as alleged by the petitioners and further it is the petitioners who have to prove that the driver of the offending vehicle was in possession of valid driving 6 license at the time of the alleged accident. Further they also contend that it is the petitioners who has to establish whether the offending Scorpio Car bearing Registration No. TN 38 R 9218 was insured with the 2nd respondent during the time of alleged accident. 9.This Court has given its anxious consideration on the rival contentions of the parties. Though the 2nd respondent deny the manner of accident as alleged by the petitioners nowhere they have categorically denied the accident. Further on perusal of Ex.P4 it reveals that on 15.05.2010 Rangasamy Gounder met with an accident and PW-2Murugesan lodged a Complaint before the K.G.Chavadi Police Station as against the driver Krishnakumar and he has also narrated the manner of accident. Further on perusal of Ex.P5 it appears that the First Information Report was closed u/s.468 of Cr.P.C as final report was not filed within the time framed. Further on perusal of Ex.P6 FIR was registered as against the driver of the offending vehicle. 10.Further the complainant Murugesan have also examined as PW-2, he could speak about the manner of accident and the complaint given by him before the K.G.Chavadi Police Station. Though he was cross examined but nothing was able to extract against the claim of the petitioners. Further it is admitted fact that in the same accident the driver of the vehicle Krishnakumar and one Subbathal who was inside this Scorpio car were also died in the same accident and 9 others were injured in the same accident. On perusal of the FIR it reveals that the deriver Krishnakumar has driven the vehicle with 10 passengers apart from him. 11.Though the 2nd Respondent contend that the 1st Respondent was not in possession of valid driving license and also drove the vehicle with 10 passengers in violation of the rules no one was examined by the 2nd Respondent in respect of the same. Hence, this court is of the considered view that the driver of the offending vehicle who is solely responsible for the accident. Hence, Point No.1 is answered accordingly. 7 POINT Nos. 2 to 4: 12.The case of the petitioners is that due to the sudden death of the deceased the petitioners were terribly shocked and the day to day life structure is paralysed as they have lost their beloved father. Further case of the petitioners is that but for the negligent act of the driver of Scorpio Car the accident would not have taken place. 13.On perusal of the counter filed by the 2nd respondent it reveals that they have not categorically denied the fact that the offending vehicle was not insured under them and having regard to the fact that the 1st respondent is the owner of the offending vehicle this court is of the considered view that the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. Further on perusal of Ex.P1 post mortem Certificate and the doctor as opined that deceased would appear to have died of effects of multiple injuries and no adverse remarks are made as against the deceased person and there is no dispute in respect of the death of the Rangasamy Gounder. 14.Further on perusal of Ex.P3 it reveals that the petitioners are the legal heirs of deceased Rangasamy Gounder, Therefore, as there is no contra evidence available as against the same this court is of the considered view that the petitioners alone are the legal heirs of Rangasamy Gounder and entitled for compensation. 15.Now coming to the quantum of compensation entitled for the petitioner, the case of the petitioners is that Rangasamy Gounder though aged about 70 years, he was earning a sum of Rs.20,000/- per month by milk vending and by cattle breeding during the relevant time of accident. 16.Now coming to the monthly income of the deceased, the case of the Petitioners is that deceased was a milk vendor and was earning a sum of Rs.500/- per day. How - ever there is no proof for the same. In so far as the income is concerned, that the 8 Honourable Supreme Court had fixed Rs.6,500/- for a vegetable vendor as monthly income in the judgment reported in 2014 (1) TNMAC 459 (SC) = 2014(2) SCC 735 [Syed Saliq vs Divisional Manager, United India Insurance Company Limited] . 17.Thought the petitioners have claimed their father was earning a sum of Rs.20,000/- per month and in support of their claim examined PW-3 however, except the oral evidence, no supportive documents were filed by them. Therefore, taking into consideration of the age of the deceased, this court fixes as the notional income of the deceased as Rs.5,000/- per month. As per the law laid in Saralavarma Case, the multiplier comes to 5 and as the deceased is aged about 70 years, the question of future prospectus will not arise. 18.It is settled principle of law that while awarding compensation it should be bear in mind that the object of providing compensation is to mitigate the hardship that has been caused to the legal representatives due to the sudden demise of the deceased in the accident. Thus the claim is for the monetary injury inflicted and loss of dependency caused to the legal representatives are the dependence of the deceased. Normally the compensation should commensurate to the loss suffered to the legal representatives. Therefore, it should be just and reasonable proportionate to the injury resulting from the death of the deceased. 19.In a given case if the claim appears to be so exorbitant and made out of ground realities the tribunal may not accept the case and may produced to determine the possible income of the deceased resorting of some guess work which may include the ground realities prevailing at the point of time depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. 20.Therefore, taking into consideration of the evidence of PW-1 and the guidelines of the Hon'ble Supreme Court notional income of the deceased is taken as Rs.5,000/- 9 per month and further as per the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Sarala Varma case the relevant multiplier is 5 and as per the law laid in the same judgment and taking Considering the fact that there are 2 claimants / dependents in the family of the deceased. 1/3rd of the monthly income of the deceased is taken for the personal expenditure of the deceased. 21.Hence, in total, in so far as the loss of income is calculated as t he income of the deceased is Rs.5,000/- ; hence Rs.5,000 x 5 x 12 = Rs.3,00,000/- and 1/3rd personal expenditure of the deceased is comes to [Rs.3,00,000 / 3 ] = Rs.1,00,000/- . And the Loss of Income of the deceased comes to [Rs.3,00,000 – Rs.1,00,000/-] is Rs.2,00,000/- Sl.No. Heads Amount 1 Loss of Income Rs.2,00,000/- 2 Loss of Love and Affection (Each Rs.5,000/-) Rs. 10,000/- 3 Funeral Expenses Rs. 20,000/- TOTAL COMPENSATION Rs. 2,30,000/- 22. From the foregoing this court is of the considered view that the petitioners are entitled in total for a sum of Rs.2,30,000/- towards compensation. And out of the said sum the Petitioners are each entitled for Rs.1,15,000/- of claim amount. Hence, the Point No.2 to 4 are answered accordingly. In the result , the petition is partly allowed and the Respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay a sum of Rs.2,30,000/- with interest to the 10 Petitioners, at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of the petition till the date of the payment with proportionate cost within three months. Out of the said sum the 1st Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.1,15,000/- with interest; and the 2nd Petitioner is entitled for a sum of Rs.1,15,000/- with interest.
