OPR. 5.Whether respondent No. 1 was driving the vehicle i.e. Car bearing registration No. DL-7ST-0400in violation of terms and conditions of Insurance Policy? OPR. 6.Relief. 11.In order to prove their case, petitioners have examined Veer Singh as PW1, petitioner No. 1 Roshani herself stepped into witness box as PW2. In documentary evidence, petitioners-claimants have tendered documents Ex.P1 to Ex.P6 12. On the other hand, respondents have examined Vinod Kumar as RW1, Tusharanshu Walia Assistant Manager, Legal Clams HDFC ERGO General Insurance Company as RW2. In documentary evidence, respondents have tendered documents Ex.R1 to Ex.R10. 13.I have heard learned counsels appearing on behalf of both sides and perused the record carefully. My issue-wise findings along with reasons are as under:- ISSUE NO. 1: 14.PW1 Veer Singh has deposed in his affidavit Ex.PW1/A that the accident in question was caused by respondent No. 1 by driving the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. He has also proved the IN MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT, PRESIDED OVER BY SUSHIL KUMAR, ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, SONEPAT. UID No. HR­0077 MACP/CIS No. 367 of 24.07.2015 Smt. Roshani Vs. Kamal & others 7 D.O.D. 13.04.2018 copy of FIR Ex.P1 which shows that the police registered the driver of the offending vehicle for causing the accident in question by driving the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. The petitioners have also placed on record the certified copy of charge sheet Ex.P2 which shows that the court of CJM,Sonepat has framed charge against respondent No. 1 for the offences punishable under Sections 279,337, 304-A IPC and 181 and 196 of Motor Vehicle Act for causing injuries to complainant Veer Singh and death of Brahmanand by driving the alleged offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner without having driving licence. The postmortem report Ex.P4 has also been placed on record which shows that cause of death of Brahmanand was hemorrhage and shock due to the injuries which were sufficient to cause death in normal course of life. The respondent No. 1 has not appeared in the witness box and therefore, this Tribunal has no reason to disbelieve the evidence of the petitioners. Hence, issue No. 1 is decided in favour of petitioners. ISSUE NO. 2: 15.PW2 Smt. Roshani has deposed that the age of her husband (deceased Brahmanand) was about 65 years and he used to earn Rs. 6,000/- per month by working as a Watch Man. No evidence has been produced by the respondents to rebut the statement of PW2 Smt. Roshani. Therefore, it is proved that the deceased Brahmanand was earning Rs. 6,000/- per month. After deducting 1/3rd income of the deceased towards his personal expenses, loss of income comes to Rs. 48,000/- per annum. As per IN MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT, PRESIDED OVER BY SUSHIL KUMAR, ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, SONEPAT. UID No. HR­0077 MACP/CIS No. 367 of 24.07.2015 Smt. Roshani Vs. Kamal & others 8 D.O.D. 13.04.2018 postmortem report, the age of the deceased was 67 years. Therefore, multiplier of 05 is applicable. By applying multiplier of 05, total loss of income comes of Rs. 2.40,000/- only. Besides the claimants are also entitled to Rs. 15,000/- for funeral expenses and Rs. 15,000/- for loss of estate in view of law laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of National Insurance Company vs. Pranay Sethi and Ors passed in Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 25590 of 2014 decided on 31.10.2017. Therefore, it is concluded that petitioners are entitled to compensation of Rs. 2,70,000/- only. 16.Now, the question for determination is whether all the respondents are liable to pay compensation to the petitioners jointly and severally. The accident in question took place due to negligence of respondent No. 1 and therefore, he is liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. The respondent No. 2 was registered owner of the offending vehicle on the date of accident. The respondent No. 2 has examined himself as RW1. He has deposed in his affidavit Ex.PW1/A that he had sold his vehicle to Deep Hyundai Enterprises Private Limited on 05.12.2014 vide receipt Ex.R1. The respondent No. 2-A has admitted that above said vehicle was purchased by it from the respondent No. 2 vide receipt Ex.R1. The respondent No. 2-A has placed on record the delivery receipt Ex.R3 which shows that the said alleged offending vehicle was purchased by Shri Rajesh Kumar (respondent No. 2-B) on 10.12.2014. No evidence has been produced by respondent No. 2-B. Therefore, I have no reason to disbelieve IN MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT, PRESIDED OVER BY SUSHIL KUMAR, ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, SONEPAT. UID No. HR­0077 MACP/CIS No. 367 of 24.07.2015 Smt. Roshani Vs. Kamal & others 9 D.O.D. 13.04.2018 the delivery receipt Ex.R3. The respondent No. 2-B has placed on record the delivery receipt Ex.R10 which shows that the alleged offending vehicle was purchased by Shri Harvinder Mandal (respondent No. 2-C) on 08.01.2015 and the alleged offending vehicle was delivered to him. The respondent No. 2-C has not contested the claim petition and therefore, it may be presumed that on the date of accident, the offending vehicle was in control and possession of the respondent No. 2-C. It has been held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of HDFC Bank vs. Kumari Reshma 2015(1) Law Herald 277 (SC) that the registered owner of the vehicle should not be held liable if the vehicle was not in his possession and control at the time of accident and it was in possession and control of another person when it met the accident. Since the offending vehicle was in possession and control of respondent No. 2, 2-A and 2-B at the time of accident, they are no liable to compensation to the petitioners. However, respondent No. 2-C is liable to pay compensation to the petitioners jointly and severally as the offending vehicle was in his possession and control when it met the accident. 17.The respondent No. 3 has been impleaded as insurer of the offending vehicle. It was the duty of the petitioners to prove that the alleged offending vehicle was insured with respondent No. 3 on the date of accident. The photocopy of one insurance policy mark RA was placed on record by the petitioners. The respondent no. 3 has examined RW2 Tusharanshu Wali, Assistant Manager and he has deposed in his affidavit Ex.RW2/A that as per IN MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT, PRESIDED OVER BY SUSHIL KUMAR, ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, SONEPAT. UID No. HR­0077 MACP/CIS No. 367 of 24.07.2015 Smt. Roshani Vs. Kamal & others 10 D.O.D. 13.04.2018 official record, the alleged insurance policy was never issued to offending vehicle No. DL-7ST-0400. He has also stated that all the policies of the respondent No. 3 contains 19 digits whereas the policy produce in the court record shows 17 digits which itself shows the fakeness of the policy. No suggestion was given to RW2 by respondent No. 1, 2 and 2-A. Therefore, there is no ground to disbelieve the statement of RW2. Since it is not proved that the alleged offending vehicle was insured with respondent No. 3, it is concluded that the respondent No. 3 is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 18.In view of my above discussion, it is concluded that petitioners are entitled to recover compensation from the respondent No. 1 and respondent No. 2-C only jointly and severally. Hence, this issue is partly decided in favour of petitioners. ISSUES NO. 3 TO 5: 19.Onus to prove these issues is on the respondents. These issues were not pressed by learned counsel for the respondents at the time of arguments, nor any evidence has been led in support of these issues. Therefore, these issues are decided against the respondents being not pressed. RELIEF: 20.In view of my above discussion on the aforesaid issues, claim petition is partly allowed with no order as to costs in favour of petitioners and against respondents. It is held that petitioners are entitled to IN MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT, PRESIDED OVER BY SUSHIL KUMAR, ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, SONEPAT. UID No. HR­0077 MACP/CIS No. 367 of 24.07.2015 Smt. Roshani Vs.

The claim petition titled as Pawan Vs.

While providing the particulars as required under the Motor Vehicles Act and the Rules framed thereunder, claimants Amarjeet, Anmol and Pawan inter alia alleged that on 8.5.2015, petitioners had gone to village Mohana from Gohana for supply of cold drinks on Maximo Mohindra No.HR-69B/0747 and after supply of cold drinks, they were going to Gohana. At about 4.30 PM when they reached at crossing of Lath-Jauli chowk, then all of a sudden, a Cruiser Jeep bearing registration No.HR- (Rajesh Sharma) MACT, Sonepat.20.7.2017. Amarjeet-Anmol-Pawan Vs. Jaideep & others. 4 61B/8018 driven by respondent No.1 came in a rash and negligent manner and hit Maxima Mohindra driven by claimant Pawan. In this accident, all three claimants suffered grievous injuries and fractures. A passerby called an ambulance and they were shifted to PGIMS, Khanpur Kalan for treatment. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of Cruiser Jeep bearing registration No.HR-61B/8018 driven by respondent No.1. On the statement of claimant Amarjeet, FIR No.154 dated 8.5.2015 was lodged by the police. Claimant Amarjeet suffered multiple simple and grievous injuries on his person and spent an amount of Rs.60,000/- on his treatment and medicines.

It is stated that no such alleged accident ever took place and alleged offending vehicle has been falsely implicated in the present case by the claimants in collusion with respondents No. 1 in order to grab the compensation from answering respondent. On merits, again the factum of accident has been denied and it is averred that no such accident took place with alleged offending vehicle due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. FIR No.154 dated 8.5.2015 is a procured document. The claimants are not entitled to claim any compensation. The amount of compensation claimed is excessive and exorbitant and petitions are liable to be dismissed. Respondent No.2 also took additional pleas that respondent No.1 was not having a valid and effective driving licence at the relevant time and was driving the vehicle in violation of terms and conditions of insurance policy.

My issue-wise findings with reasons are as under - ISSUE No.1 (in all three petitions) 12. Onus to prove this issue was upon the petitioners. Under this issue, petitioners were required to prove that on 8.5.2015 at about 4.30 P.M., an accident took place due to negligence of respondent No.1 i.e. driver of offending vehicle bearing Registration No.HR-61B/8018, due to which, they (Amarjeet, Anmol and Pawan) sustained injuries. 13.In order to prove this issue, petitioners Pawan, Anmol and Amarjeet in all three petitions have examined themselves as PW1, PW2 and PW3 respectively who tendered their duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW1/A, Ex.PW2/A and Ex.PW3/A respectively in their evidence and reiterated the averments of petitions. They deposed that on 8.5.2015, petitioners had gone (Rajesh Sharma) MACT, Sonepat.20.7.2017. Amarjeet-Anmol-Pawan Vs. Jaideep & others. 8 to village Mohana from Gohana for supply of cold drinks in Maximo Mohindra No.HR-69B/0747 and after supply of cold drinks, they were going to Gohana. At about 4.30 PM when they reached at crossing of Lath-Jauli chowk, then all of a sudden, a Cruiser Jeep bearing registration No.HR- 61B/8018 driven by respondent No.1 in a rash and negligent manner and hit Maxima Mohndra driven by claimant Pawan. In this accident, all three claimants suffered grievous injuries and fractures. A passerby called an ambulance and they were shifted to PGIMS, Khanpur Kalan for treatment. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of Cruiser Jeep bearing registration No.HR-61B/8018 driven by respondent No.1. On the statement of claimant Amarjeet, FIR No.154 dated 8.5.2015 was lodged by the police. 14.Further, it is apparent from Ex.P1 Final report and FIR Ex.P8 under Sections 279/337/338 IPC that prosecution of respondent No.1 Jaideep was going on and vide charge-sheet Ex.P2, charge has been framed against him. These facts are themselves sufficient corroboration to testimony of witnesses examined by petitioners. 15.As against this cogent oral as well as documentary evidence regarding the manner of accident, no evidence whatsoever has been produced by the respondents. Even the respondent no.1 has not contested the claim petitions by appearing before the Tribunal and he was proceeded against exparte. It is settled law that where driver of offending vehicle does not come forward to deny his negligence, there is a presumption that the claim of the claimant is correct. In this regard, reliance may be placed upon the law laid (Rajesh Sharma) MACT, Sonepat.20.7.2017. Amarjeet-Anmol-Pawan Vs. Jaideep & others. 9 down in Raju & others Vs. Sukhvinder Singh and others, 2006(4) RCR(Civil) page 82 . In view of my above discussions and reasonings and in the light of law discussed above, this Tribunal reaches at the conclusion that accident in question took place due to negligent driving of vehicle No.HR-61B/8018 by respondent No.1 being its driver, due to which, claimants Amarjeet, Anmol and Pawan sustained injuries. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners and against the respondents. I SSUE No.2 (in all claim petitions) - 16.In claim petition titled as Amarjeet Vs. Jaideep and others, claimant has claimed a compensation of Rs.10 lacs on account of injuries caused by him in the accident in question. It is the case of claimant Amarjeet that after the accident, a passerby called an ambulance and shifted them to PGIMS, Khanpur Kalan for treatment. Claimant Amarjeet has tendered his MLR Ex.PA in evidence in which two injuries have been shown. However, claimant Amarjeet did not tender any medical bill which shows that he spent no amount on medicines etc., because, PGIMS, Khanpur Kalan is government hospital and treatment in all government hospitals is given free of costs. Thus, no amount is given to claimant Amarjeet on account of medicines etc. Since claimant Amarjeet sustained two injuries, he must have suffered some pain and sufferings, so, claimant Amarjeet is granted Rs.10,000/- on account of pain and suffering caused to him in this accident. 17. In claim petition titled as Anmol Vs. Jaideep and others, claimant has claimed a compensation of Rs.10 lacs on account of injuries (Rajesh Sharma) MACT, Sonepat.20.7.2017. Amarjeet-Anmol-Pawan Vs. Jaideep & others. 10 caused to him in the accident in question. It is the case of claimant Anmol that after the accident, a passerby called an ambulance and shifted them to PGIMS, Khanpur Kalan for treatment. Claimant Anmol has tendered his MLR Ex.PB in evidence in which two injuries have been shown. However, claimant Anmol did not tender any medical bill which shows that he spent no amount on medicines etc., because, PGIMS, Khanpur Kalan is government hospital and treatment in all government hospitals is given free of costs. Thus, no amount is given to claimant Anmol on account of medicines etc. Since claimant Anmol sustained two injuries, he must have suffered some pain and sufferings, so, claimant Anmol is granted Rs.10,000/- on account of pain and suffering caused by him in this accident. 18. In claim petition titled as Pawan Vs. Jaideep and others, claimant has claimed a compensation of Rs.20 lacs on account of injuries caused to him in the accident in question. It is the case of claimant Pawan that after the accident, a passerby called an ambulance and shifted them to PGIMS, Khanpur Kalan for treatment. Claimant Pawan has tendered his MLR Ex.P18 in evidence. He was suffering from post fracture right femur and BB leg with ORIF and fracture left patella. He tendered Ex.P12, Ex.P13, Ex.P15 and Ex.P16 which are amounting to Rs.15,698/-, so, the amount of Rs.15,698/- is granted to claimant Pawan being amount spent on treatment and medicines. Claimant Pawan has also tendered disability certificate Ex.P19 which shows that he has become 43% temporary disabled. Claimant has not examined the concerned doctor who could have explained better regarding the (Rajesh Sharma) MACT, Sonepat.20.7.2017. Amarjeet-Anmol-Pawan Vs. Jaideep & others. 11 injuries of claimant. It may be mentioned that due to fracture of right femur and fracture of left patella, the claimant will have difficulty in walking/climbing stairs and will be unable to walk fast or run. Hence, the claimant will suffer loss of enjoyment of life and loss of amenities. Thus, in view of 43% disability, an amount of Rs.43,000/- is granted to claimant Pawan on account of temporary disability and Rs.20,000/- on account of loss of enjoyment of life and loss of amenities. Claimant Pawan was suffering from fractures, so, he must have suffered pain and sufferings and hence, claimant Pawan is granted Rs.20,000/- on account of pain and suffering caused to him in this accident. During the treatment, claimant visited the hospital and spent on transportation. Thus, claimant is granted Rs.10,000/- on account of transportation. Claimant is also granted Rs.5000/- on account of special diet. Thus, a total compensation of Rs.1,13,698/- (Rs.one lac thirteen thousand six hundred nintyeight only) is granted to claimant Pawan. 19.The next question to be determined is as to who is liable to pay the compensation? Claimants have tendered in evidence certified copy of driving licence of respondent No.1 which was issued on 15.4.2014 and is valid upto 14.4.2034 and said driving licence is for driving of M.C. with gear, LMV-NT-Car, LMV Tractor only. Respondent No.2 has not produced any evidence to show that said driving licence is not a valid and effective driving licence. Claimants have also tendered Ex.P10 insurance police which shows that it is valid from 15.1.2015 till 14.1.2016 midnight. Date of accident is 8.5.2015. Thus, the liability to make the payment shall be joint and several of both the respondents, but, ultimately liability of payment lies with respondent (Rajesh Sharma) MACT, Sonepat.20.7.2017. Amarjeet-Anmol-Pawan Vs. Jaideep & others. 12 No.2 as offending vehicle was insured with it and respondent No.2 is bound to indemnify respondent No.1, the registered owner of offending vehicle.

The petitioners are required to lead evidence that accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of Car bearing registration no. HR 10U- 0155 by respondent no.1 . In order to prove this issue, petitioner Ganeshi, petitioner Jantri alias Savita and petitioner Ramesh stepped into the Master Kalicharan, Rohit, Rahul, Ganeshi, Savita and Ramesh etc vs Suresh etc 14 witness box and tendered their affidavit Ex.

When they reached near village Kheri Damkan, the offending vehicle car bearing registration no. HR 10U-0155, driven by respondent no.1 came in a rash and negligent manner and struck against three wheeler. Due to which deceased Ram Bharose and other petitioners, received injuries and Ram Bharose died. The version mentioned in the petition is supported by FIR Ex P3, and PMR of Ram Bharose Ex P10, Chalan Ex P9 as well as evidence of eye witnesses/petitioners Ganeshi, Jantri and Ramesh of the alleged accident. 13.This oral as well as documentary evidence of the petitioners has gone completely un-rebutted and unchallenged. A perusal of copy of the first information report Ex P3 shows that the case regarding the accident Master Kalicharan, Rohit, Rahul, Ganeshi, Savita and Ramesh etc vs Suresh etc 15 in question was registered on the basis of statement of Ramesh injured/eye witness of the alleged accident. The registration number of the offending vehicle involved in the accident was mentioned in the FIR as HR 10U-0155 and the FIR was promptly lodged on the date of accident. The version put forth in the first information report regarding the factum and manner of the accident is entirely in consonance with the statement of eye witnesses/injured PW1 Ganeshi, PW2 Jantri and PW3 Ramesh. They categorically stated that the accident in question had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle bearing registration no. HR 10U-0155 by the respondent no.1. 14.Had the accident not taken place due to the rash and negligent driving of the vehicle in question by the respondent no.1, then as a man of ordinary prudence, he must have approached the higher police authorities for cancellation of the case, but neither there are pleadings nor any evidence on record to show that any step was taken by him in this direction. This conduct on the part of the respondent no.1 of remaining silent goes against him. Even Respondent no.1 has not dared to appear in the witness -box to prove that the accident in question had not taken place due to his rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Under such circumstances, it would be prima-facie safe and prudent to conclude that the accident in question took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by the respondent no.1. In this context, reference Master Kalicharan, Rohit, Rahul, Ganeshi, Savita and Ramesh etc vs Suresh etc 16 with advantage may also be made to R adhey Shayam Versus Girdhari Lal 1993 (2) P.L.R., 109. 15.From the statement of PW1 Ganeshi, PW2 Janti and PW3 Ramesh coupled with the copy of FIR Ex. P3 and report under section 173 Cr.PC Ex P9, PMR Ex P10, it stands established that Ram Bharose died in the motor vehicular accident and petitioners Kali Charan, Rahul, Rohit, Janti, Ramesh and Ganeshi received grievous injuries due to rash and negligent driving by respondent no.1. 16.In view of the fore-going circumstances, I arrive at the conclusion that the accident in question resulting into death of Ram Bharose and injuries to other petitioners took place due to the rash and negligent driving of vehicle bearing no. HR 10U-0155 by the respondent No.1. Hence, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUE No. 2: Claim Petition CIS No.519 of 2015 titled as Master Kali Charan vs Suresh etc. 17.

The petitioner must have undergone the agony of physical as well as mental pain and sufferings on account of the injuries received in the accident. No hard and fast rule can perhaps be laid down for assessing the compensation for the pain and sufferings undergone by an injured. However, the nature of the injuries, parts of the body involved, the period of hospitalization, the period required for recovery from the injuries and age and socio-economic conditions of the injured can be the guiding factors.

The petitioner deposed that she received injuries and was shifted to BPS Khanpur and thereafter she was shifted to PGIMS Rohtak. She deposed that she spent Rs. one lac on her treatment, medicine, transportation etc and her treatment is still going on. She deposed that she used to earn Rs 25,000/- per month as she was running a dairy and used to sell milk and after the accident she is unable to do any work. But the petitioner has not placed on record any medical record of treatment and any document to prove her income. In the absence of which it cannot be said that petitioner was earning Rs.25,000/- per month. 44.However, It is settled law that the Motor Vehicles Act is a welfare legislation. It has been promulgated to give relief to the injured of road side accidents. The contents of the petitions for claim are not to be substantiated strictly by the Indian Evidence Act in the like manner in cases concerning to civil as well as criminal nature. 45 Petitioner Janti alias Savita has not proved any medical bill regarding total amount spent by her on her treatment. The petitioner has placed on record Ex P104 to Ex P106. Ex P104 and Ex P105 are identity proof of Janti and Ex P106 is medical bill, which is of Kamlesh. As such there is no medical record on the file regarding receiving injuries by Janti.

K eeping in view the facts and circumstances an amount of Rs 10,000/- is granted as compensation to the petitioner. (7) Claim Petition CIS No. 522of 2015 titled as Ganeshi etc vs Suresh etc. 47This claim petition is in respect of death of Ram Bharose. In this claim petition, petitioner Ganeshi when appeared in the witness box as PW1 has testified that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. Ex P3 is the copy of FIR. It is, therefore, crystal clear that immediately after the accident deceased was shifted to Khanpur Medical College where he succumbed to the injuries sustained in the accident. She proved post mortem report Ex P10 of deceased Ram Bharose. After going through the entire evidence on the Master Kalicharan, Rohit, Rahul, Ganeshi, Savita and Ramesh etc vs Suresh etc 30 file it is clear that deceased Ram Bharose died due to the injuries suffered in the accident. 48.In the claim petition, it has been submitted that the deceased was earning Rs.15,000/- per month as he was Mason. In order to prove the income of deceased the petitioner has not placed on record any document to prove the income of deceased as Rs 15,000/- per month. In order to prove the income of deceased Ram Bharose, petitioners have examined PW3 Ram Kanwar, who deposed that deceased Ram Bharose was working in his house and he used to give Rs. 1000/- per day. But the oral evidence of PW3 is not sufficient to the income of the deceased. Therefore, version of petitioner that deceased was earning Rs 15,000/- is not reliable. During cross-examination petitioner deposed that she has no documentary proof regarding income of deceased. The petitioners have not placed on record any document to prove the income of deceased. In the absence of which it cannot be said that deceased was earning Rs.15,000/- per month. The petitioners have not placed on record any document to prove the age of deceased. In the post mortem report age of the deceased is mentioned as 35 years. Therefore, for the purpose of assessing compensation, it would be proper to consider the age of the deceased as 35 years at the time of his death. Master Kalicharan, Rohit, Rahul, Ganeshi, Savita and Ramesh etc vs Suresh etc 31 49 Now, coming to the dependency. Petitioner no.1 is wife of deceased and petitioners no.2 to 4 are children and petitioners no.5 and 6 are parents of deceased. 50 It has been stated by PW1 that after the death of Ram Bharose they have no other source of income. The evidence adduced by the petitioners has gone unrebutted on this point. Petitioner no.1 being wife and petitioners no.2 to 4 being children and petitioners no. 5 and 6 being parents/legal heirs of deceased are entitled to get compensation for the death of the deceased in the ill-fated accident. 51The petitioners have not placed on record any document to support the allegations that deceased used to earn Rs.15,000/- per month. In other words he was a mason and could have earned sufficient monthly income to maintain his family consisting him i.e. his wife and children and parents. Deceased was working as mason. Therefore, the income of the deceased was certainly more than a male casual labourer. Accordingly, for the purpose of assessing the compensation, the income of deceased is assessed at Rs.7,000/- per month In view of authority titled as Munna Lal Jain vs Vipin Kumar Sharma 2015(6) SCC 347 and Shri Ram General Insurance Company Limited vs Karnail Kaur and others 2015-4, PLR 324, the deceased being of 35 years of age at the time of his death, 50% income earned by him is to be added as prospects of future income and considering the age of deceased as 35 Master Kalicharan, Rohit, Rahul, Ganeshi, Savita and Ramesh etc vs Suresh etc 32 years the total income of the deceased after adding 50% of the income comes to Rs.10,500/- per month i.e. 1,26,000/- per year. It has also been laid down by the Apex Court in Smt. Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transportation Corporation and another 2009 (3) PLR 22, where the deceased was married, the deduction towards personal and living expenses of the deceased should be one third where the number of dependant family members is 2 to 3, one fourth where the number of the dependant family members is 4 to 6 and one fifth where the number of dependant family members exceeds six. Therefore, after deducting one fourth of the income of the deceased as her personal expenses, contribution towards his family comes to Rs. 94500/-per year. As per law laid down in Smt. Sarla Verma and others’ case 2009-3, PLR 22 the multiplier to be applied is of 16 So, the compensation after applying multiplier of 16 comes to 94500x16=15,12,000/- 52.The petitioners might have suffered some expenses on the last rites of the deceased besides suffering loss of estate. As per law laid down in Rajesh and others vs Rajbir Singh and others 2013 (3) RCR (Civil) 170(SC), petitioner's wife is awarded an amount of Rs.1,00,000/- towards loss of consortium. The petitioners are further allowed Rs.25,000/- towards funeral expenses and Rs 1,00,000/- are granted for love and affection to the children of the deceased. Thus, the Master Kalicharan, Rohit, Rahul, Ganeshi, Savita and Ramesh etc vs Suresh etc 33 total amount payable to the petitioners comes to Rs. 17,37,000/-/- . Issue no.2 is decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUE NO.3&4 53 In view of my finding on the above said issues, the present petitions are very much maintainable. The respondent no.2 has raised the plea that the respondent no. 1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the accident. Ex R2 is photocopy of DL. Perusal of copy of driving licence Ex R2 of respondent no.1 reveals that it was valid for driving motorcycle, car scooter jeep on the date of the accident. Respondent has not produced any evidence that driving license Ex R2 is fake and unvalid. LIABILITY; 54.Now, I advert to deal with the question of liability of the respondents to pay compensation. A perusal of Ex R1 insurance policy reveal that the offending vehicle no. HR 10U-0155 was insured with respondent no.3. In the written statement respondent no.3 has not taken the plea that the vehicle was not insured with respondent no.3 at the time of accident. In these circumstances, insurance company is liable to make the payment of compensation to the claimants, being insurer of vehicle in question. 55.In these circumstances, the petitioners in petition no.522 of 2015 titled as Ganeshi etc vs Sureshi etc are held entitled to get Master Kalicharan, Rohit, Rahul, Ganeshi, Savita and Ramesh etc vs Suresh etc 34 compensation of 17,37,000/- on account of death of Ram Bharose in the accident Petitioner in petition titled as Kalicharan vs Suresh is entitled to get Rs 10,000/- .

Petitioner Ramesh in petition titled as Ramesh vs Suresh is entitled to get Rs.68185/- and petitioner Ganeshi in petition titled as Ganeshi vs Suresh is entitled to get Rs 63,185/- on account of injuries suffered by her in the ill fated accident. The respondent nos. 1 to 3 are held liable to pay the amount of compensation jointly as well as severally. As the vehicle i.e Car no. HR 10U-0155 was insured with respondent no.3 Insurance Company, therefore respondent no.3 would be liable to make the payment of amount of compensation. Hence, these issues are accordingly decided against the respondents. RELIEF 56In view of the above said discussion, all the petitions are hereby allowed partly. In these circumstances, the petitioners in petition no.522 of 2015 titled as Ganeshi etc vs Suresh etc are held entitled to get compensation of 17,37,000/- on account of death of Ram Bharose in the accident.

The claim petition titled as Prem Shankar and other Versus Harish and others has been filed by the petitioners for compensation to the tune of Rs.25 lacs on account of death of their son Vikram @ Vicky in the accident in question. The claim petition titled as Babli and other Versus Harish and others has been filed by the petitioners for compensation to the tune of Rs.10 lacs on account of death of their son Ravi Kumar in the accident in question. 3. While providing the particulars as required under the Motor Vehicles Act and the Rules framed thereunder, claimants inter alia alleged that on 09.10.2014, Amit Kumar alongwith his friends Ravi son of Krishan Kumar and Vicky son of Prem Shankar had gone to Bahalgarh for procuring work of whitewash on motorcycle No.HR-12E/5391. Krishan Kumar also came at Bahalgarh to see them. At about 12 O'clock in the night, Amit Kumar and his above-said two friends were coming to Sonepat on aforesaid motorcycle driven by Amit deceased. Krishan Kumar was coming behind them. When they reached near Truck Union in the area of Sector-12, Sonepat, a Dumpher bearing No.HR-62/1580 came from front side at a very high speed driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and struck (Hukam Singh) MACT, Sonepat. 7.11.2016. Renu & others Vs. Harish & others 4 against the motorcycle. Due to accident, Amit Kumar and his two friends fell on the road alongwith motorcycle and motorcycle got fire. Driver of Dumpher stopped his vehicle on the side of road. After the accident, Krishan Kumar came at the spot and started looking after his son and his friends. The accident was caused due to sole rash and negligent driving of driver of Dumpher. After the accident, driver of Dumpher fled away alongwith his Dumpher from the spot. Krishan Kumar shifted all three injured to Civil hospital, Sonepat where Amit Kumar and Ravi were declared brought dead and injured Vicky was referred to PGIMS Rohtak but he also died on the way. Police lodged FIR No.399 dated 10.10.2014 under Sections 279/304A IPC on the statement of Krishan Kumar. Deceased Amit Kumar and Vikram @ Vicky were engaged in whitewash contract and used to earn Rs.20,000/- per month each. Deceased Ravi Kumar used to earn Rs.8000/- per month by helping his father in his business. After the death of deceased, claimants have suffered from a great pain, mental torture and agony besides financial loss. The accident was caused due to sole negligence of respondent No.1 driver of offending vehicle and respondent No.2 is registered owner of offending vehicle and the offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.3 at the time of accident and hence, all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to compensate the petitioners. 4.Respondents No.1 and 2 filed their joint written statement in which, most of the allegations of claim petitions were denied for want of knowledge. It was denied that alleged accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of Dumpher in question by respondent No.1. A false case has been got registered (Hukam Singh) MACT, Sonepat. 7.11.2016. Renu & others Vs. Harish & others 5 against respondent No.1 with ulterior motive to extract money from answering respondents. In fact, motorcyclist alongwith two pillion riders was driving his motorcycle rashly and negligently and at a high speed and lost his control and struck the same with Dumper in question. As admitted by the petitioners, three persons were travelling on the motorcycle in question which is illegal and act of motorcyclist was itself illegal. Deceased were not earning anything and income of deceased has been shown highly excessive and the amount claimed is highly excessive, exorbitant and without any basis. The petition is wrong, false, frivolous and the accident did not take place due to rash and negligent driving of Dumpher in question by respondent No.1 and a false case has been got lodged against respondent No.1 by claimants. Respondent No.3 is liable to pay the compensation as the vehicle was insured with it. With these pleas, respondents No.1 and 2 prayed for dismissal of the present petition. 5.Respondent No.3 insurance company, in its reply took preliminary objections regarding maintainability and cause of action and relied upon all the defences available to it under Motor Vehicles Act. While claiming further, respondent No.3 alleged that the respondent No.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence and the alleged accident was not caused due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. In reply on merits, the allegations including earning capacity of deceased Amit Kumar and Vikram @ Vicky as Rs.20,000/- per month each and deceased Ravi Kumar as Rs.8,000/- per month were again controverted and further pleaded that such accident was never taken place with the vehicle bearing No.HR- 62/1580 and the same has been falsely implicated by the claimants in collusion with (Hukam Singh) MACT, Sonepat. 7.11.2016. Renu & others Vs. Harish & others 6 the police and respondents No.1&2 in order to grab the compensation from the answering respondent and a false case has been got registered.

My issue-wise findings alongwith reasons are as under:- ISSUE No.1(all three cases) - 13.Onus to prove this issue was upon the petitioners. Under this issue, petitioners were required to prove that on 9.10.2014 in the area of Sector-12, near Truck Union, Sonepat, accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of Dumpher No.HR-62/1580 by respondent No.1 i.e. driver of offending vehicle, due to which, Amit Kumar, Vikram @ Vicky and Ravi Kumar died. In order to prove this issue, petitioners Renu and Prem Shankar appeared in the witness-box as PW1 and petitioner Bindu as PW2. Petitioners Renu, Prem Parkash and Bindu tendered their duly sworn affidavits Ex.PW1/A and Ex.PW2/A in their evidence and reiterated the averments of petitions. Petitioners (Hukam Singh) MACT, Sonepat. 7.11.2016. Renu & others Vs. Harish & others 10 have also examined Krishan, eye-witness of accident as PW2. He has also tendered his duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW2/A in his evidence and deposed that the accident in question was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1 which struck against the motorcycle and caused death of Amit Kumar, Vikram @ Vicky and Ravi Kumar. He has also deposed that FIR No.399 dated 110.10.2014 under Sections 279/304A IPC was registered on his statement. Further, it is apparent that vide report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex.P1, a prosecution was launched against respondent No.1. These facts are themselves sufficient corroboration to testimony of witnesses. In Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Shyam and others, 1993(2) PLR 109, Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court has observed that if FIR is registered against the driver, it is prima facie safe to conclude that accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle by its driver. To rebut this cogent oral as well as documentary evidence regarding the manner of accident, respondent No.1 stepped into witness-box as RW5 and tendered his duly sworn affidavit Ex.RW5/A. He admitted the occurrence of accident but alleged that the accident in question was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of motorcycle by motorcyclist. His sole statement is not sufficient to prove his allegations. On the other hand, claimants have produced sufficient evidence to prove negligence of respondent No.1. Another plea of claimants is that in the above mentioned accident, deceased Amit, Vikram @ vicky and Ravi Kumar had suffered injuries which proved fatal for them. To prove these facts, in addition to oral testimony of PWs, claimants (Hukam Singh) MACT, Sonepat. 7.11.2016. Renu & others Vs. Harish & others 11 have placed on record Post Mortem Report Ex.P2 of deceased Ravi, Post Mortem Report Ex.P3 of deceased Amit and Post Mortem Report Ex.P2 of deceased Vikram @ Vicky perusal of which show that deceased had died on 10.10.2014 on account of injuries suffered by them on the same day. In view of my above discussions and reasonings and in the light of law discussed above, this Tribunal reached at the conclusion that accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1, due to which, Amit, Vikram @ Vicky and Ravi died. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners and against the respondents. I SSUE No.2(All three cases) - 14.In claim petition titled as Renu and other Vs. Harish and others, claimants have claimed a compensation of Rs.20 lacs on account of death of their son Amit in the accident in question. It is the case of claimants that deceased Amit was earning Rs.20,000/- per month from whitewash contract. Claimant Renu appeared in witness-box as PW1 and has also reiterated the above facts. However, the petitioners have not produced any documentary evidence to prove that deceased Amit was earning Rs.20,000/- per month. But, it has been proved that deceased was a young and healthy person. In the given circumstances, the inference can be drawn that deceased Amit must be capable of earning equal to the income of unskilled labour and it can safely be assumed that deceased must have been earning minimum wage of unskilled labour which was about Rs.5500/- per month at the time of accident. Thus, annual income of deceased comes out to be Rs.66,000/- (Rs.5500/- x 12). 15.As far as the age of deceased Amit is concerned, no document has been (Hukam Singh) MACT, Sonepat. 7.11.2016. Renu & others Vs. Harish & others 12 produced by the claimants in order to ascertain his age. In PMR Ex.P3, age of deceased Amit has been mentioned as 24 years. Hence, age of deceased is held to be 24 years at the time of his death. 16.Loss of dependency consists of three components for its determination viz. Future prospectus, income of deceased after deduction to be made and multiplier to be adopted. In Rajesh Vs. Rajbir etc., 2013, ACJ, 1403 , Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has laid down the formula for increase of income covering future prospectus. In the above mentioned case, it has been laid down that future prospectus shall be allowed 50% of actual income (after deduction of tax) for the persons below the age of 40 years, 30% for the age group of 40 to 50 years and 15% for the age group of 50 to 60 years and no addition thereafter. In the present case, the age of deceased has been held to be 24 years. Therefore, in view of law laid down in the case Rajesh Vs. Rajbir (supra) , 50% of actual income of deceased has to be increased towards future prospectus. After increased by 50%, annual income of deceased Amit comes out to be Rs.99,000/- (Rs.66,000/- + Rs.33,000/-). 17.As far as deduction towards personal expenses of deceased is concerned, deceased Amit was married at the time of accident and in the claim petition, the compensation has been claimed by his wife, three minor children and mother who are stated to be only dependents of the deceased. In view of these facts and relying upon the law laid down in case of Sarla Verma & Ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & others, 2009(3) RCR (Civil) page 77(SC), 1/4th of the total income of deceased is to be deducted on account of personal and living expenses. After deducting 1/4th of the total income, annual dependency of claimants (Hukam Singh) MACT, Sonepat. 7.11.2016. Renu & others Vs. Harish & others 13 comes out to be Rs.74,250/-. Age of deceased has been held to be 24 years at the time of his death. In view of law laid down in Sarla Verma's case (supra) , the multiplier of '18' is applicable. By applying the multiplier of 18, total compensation comes to Rs.13,36,500/- (74250/- x 18). Apart from that, claimants have also claimed compensation on account of loss of consortium for claimant No.1, loss of love and affection for claimants no.1 and 2 and an amount incurred on funeral and last rites of deceased. Claimant No.1 is widow of deceased Amit. She lost her husband. She has lost valuable company of her husband at a young age and therefore, for the loss of consortium, she must be compensated adequately. In view of Rajesh (supra)' case,, Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rs. One lac only) is awarded to claimant No.1 as a compensation for the loss of consortium being widow of deceased and Rs.50,000/- (Rs.fifty thousand only) is awarded to claimants No.2 to 4 for loss of love and affection and Rs.5,000/- (Rs. Five thousand only) towards expenses spent on transportation and Rs.10,000/- (Rs.ten thousand only) towards funeral expenses. Thus, total amount of compensation comes to Rs.15,01,500/- (Rs. fifteen lacs one thousand five hundred only). 18.In claim petition titled as Prem Shankar and other Vs. Harish and others, claimants have claimed a compensation of Rs.25 lacs on account of death of their son Vikram @ Vicky in the accident in question. Claimants Prem Shankar and Bindu appeared in witness-box as PW1 and PW2 and reiterated the contents of petition. It is the case of claimants that deceased Vikram @ Vicky was earning Rs.20,000/- per month from whitewash contract. However, the petitioners have not (Hukam Singh) MACT, Sonepat. 7.11.2016. Renu & others Vs. Harish & others 14 produced any documentary evidence to prove that deceased Vikram @ Vicky was earning Rs.20,000/- per month. But, it has been proved that deceased was a young and healthy person. In the given circumstances, the inference can be drawn that deceased Vikram @ Vicky must be capable of earning equal to the income of unskilled labour and it can safely be assumed that deceased must have been earning minimum wage of unskilled labour which was about Rs.5500/- per month at the time of accident. Thus, annual income of deceased comes out to be Rs.66,000/- (Rs.5500/- x 12). 19.As far as the age of deceased Vikram @ Vicky is concerned, no document has been produced by the claimants in order to ascertain his age. In PMR Ex.P2, age of deceased Vikram @ Vicky has been mentioned as 18 years. Hence, age of deceased is held to be 18 years at the time of his death. 20.Loss of dependency consists of three components for its determination viz. Future prospectus, income of deceased after deduction to be made and multiplier to be adopted. In Rajesh Vs. Rajbir etc., 2013, ACJ, 1403 , Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has laid down the formula for increase of income covering future prospectus. In the above mentioned case, it has been laid down that future prospectus shall be allowed 50% of actual income (after deduction of tax) for the persons below the age of 40 years, 30% for the age group of 40 to 50 years and 15% for the age group of 50 to 60 years and no addition thereafter. In the present case, the age of deceased has been held to be 18 years. Therefore, in view of law laid down in the case Rajesh Vs. Rajbir (supra) , 50% of actual income of deceased has to be increased towards future prospectus. After increased by 50%, annual income of deceased Amit comes out to be Rs.99,000/- (Hukam Singh) MACT, Sonepat. 7.11.2016. Renu & others Vs. Harish & others 15 (Rs.66,000/- + Rs.33,000/-). 21.As far as deduction towards personal expenses of deceased is concerned, deceased Vikram @ Vicky was unmarried at the time of accident and in the claim petition, the compensation has been claimed by his parents who are stated to be only dependents of the deceased. In view of these facts and relying upon the law laid down in case of Sarla Verma & Ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & others, 2009(3) RCR (Civil) page 77(SC), ½ of the total income of deceased is to be deducted on account of personal and living expenses. After deducting ½ of the total income, annual dependency of claimants comes out to be Rs.49,500/-. Age of deceased has been held to be 18 years at the time of his death. In view of law laid down in Sarla Verma's case (supra) , the multiplier of '18' is applicable. By applying the multiplier of 18, total compensation comes to Rs.8,91,000/- (49,500/- x 18). Apart from that, claimants have also claimed compensation on account of loss of love and affection for claimants no.1 and 2 and an amount incurred on funeral and last rites of deceased. Claimants have lost their son. In view of Rajesh case (supra), Rs.50,000/- (Rs.fifty thousand only) is awarded to claimants for loss of love and affection and Rs.5,000/- (Rs. Five thousand only) towards expenses spent on transportation and Rs.10,000/- (Rs.ten thousand only) towards funeral expenses. Thus, total amount of compensation comes to Rs.9,56,000/- (Rs. nine lacs fiftysix thousand only). 22.In claim petition titled as Babli and other Vs. Harish and others, claimants have claimed a compensation of Rs.10 lacs on account of death of their (Hukam Singh) MACT, Sonepat. 7.11.2016. Renu & others Vs. Harish & others 16 son Ravi Kumar in the accident in question. Claimant Krishan appeared in witness- box as PW2 and reiterated the contents of petition. It is the case of claimants that deceased Ravi Kumar was earning Rs.8,000/- per month by helping his father in his business. However, the petitioners have not produced any documentary evidence to prove that deceased Ravi Kumar was earning Rs.8,000/- per month. But, it has been proved that deceased was a young and healthy person. In the given circumstances, the inference can be drawn that deceased Ravi Kumar must be capable of earning equal to the income of unskilled labour and it can safely be assumed that deceased must have been earning minimum wage of unskilled labour which was about Rs.5500/- per month at the time of accident. Thus, annual income of deceased comes out to be Rs.66,000/- (Rs.5500/- x 12). 23.As far as the age of deceased Ravi Kumar is concerned, no document has been produced by the claimants in order to ascertain his age. In PMR Ex.P2, age of deceased Ravi Kumar has been mentioned as 15 years. Hence, age of deceased is held to be 15 years at the time of his death. 24.Loss of dependency consists of three components for its determination viz. Future prospectus, income of deceased after deduction to be made and multiplier to be adopted. In Rajesh Vs. Rajbir etc., 2013, ACJ, 1403 , Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has laid down the formula for increase of income covering future prospectus. In the above mentioned case, it has been laid down that future prospectus shall be allowed 50% of actual income (after deduction of tax) for the persons below the age of 40 years, 30% for the age group of 40 to 50 years and 15% for the age group of 50 to 60 years and no addition thereafter. In the present case, the age of deceased has been held to be 18 years. (Hukam Singh) MACT, Sonepat. 7.11.2016. Renu & others Vs. Harish & others 17 Therefore, in view of law laid down in the case Rajesh Vs. Rajbir (supra) , 50% of actual income of deceased has to be increased towards future prospectus. After increased by 50%, annual income of deceased Amit comes out to be Rs.99,000/- (Rs.66,000/- + Rs.33,000/-). 25.As far as deduction towards personal expenses of deceased is concerned, deceased Ravi Kumar was unmarried at the time of accident and in the claim petition, the compensation has been claimed by his parents who are stated to be only dependents of the deceased. In view of these facts and relying upon the law laid down in case of Sarla Verma & Ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & others, 2009(3) RCR (Civil) page 77(SC), ½ of the total income of deceased is to be deducted on account of personal and living expenses. After deducting ½ of the total income, annual dependency of claimants comes out to be Rs.49,500/-. Age of deceased has been held to be 15 years at the time of his death. In view of law laid down in Sarla Verma's case (supra) , the multiplier of '18' is applicable. By applying the multiplier of 18, total compensation comes to Rs.8,91,000/- (49,500/- x 18). Apart from that, claimants have also claimed compensation on account of loss of love and affection for claimants no.1 and 2 and an amount incurred on funeral and last rites of deceased. Claimants have lost their son. In view of Rajesh case (supra), Rs.50,000/- (Rs.fifty thousand only) is awarded to claimants for loss of love and affection and Rs.5,000/- (Rs. Five thousand only) towards expenses spent on transportation and Rs.10,000/- (Rs.ten thousand only) towards funeral expenses. Thus, total amount of compensation comes to Rs.9,56,000/- (Rs. nine lacs fiftysix (Hukam Singh) MACT, Sonepat. 7.11.2016. Renu & others Vs. Harish & others 18 thousand only). 26.The question now arises as to who is liable to pay the compensation? As per petitioners, respondent No.1 was driving offending vehicle at the time of accident in a rash and negligent manner. Respondent No.2, owner of offending vehicle, has examined Ravinder Singh as RW1 who tendered photocopy of driving licence of respondent No.1. Respondent No.1 appeared into witness-box as RW5 and tendered a photocopy of his driving licence as Ex.R13 which is different from driving licence Ex.R1 tendered by RW1 Ravinder Singh. Respondent No.3 Insurance Company has claimed that respondent No.1 driver of offending vehicle was not having a valid driving licence at the time of accident. Respondent No.3 insurance company examined Devender Sharma, Investigator, to prove that driving licence produced by respondent No.1 driver and respondent No.2 owner are fake. Perusal of testimony of RW3 Parveen Kumar, Ahlmad, shows that respondent No.1 gave his driving licence No.100910/MKG issued from Nagaland to plice during investigation of case FIR No.399 of 2014 under Sections 279/304A IPC lodged against him. Respondent No.2 owner of offending vehicle produced driving licence No.NL-0220090015010 of respondent No.1 Harish on case file. RW2 Devender Sharma, Investigator, tendered documents Ex.R2 to Ex.R9 in his evidence which shows that both licences bearing No. 100910/MKG and No.NL- 0220090015010 are not issued by Licencing Authority, Nagaland. No evidence was produced to controvert the claim of insurance company either by respondent No.1 driver or by respondent No.2, owner of offending vehicle. Thus, it has been proved that both licences are not valid licences. (Hukam Singh) MACT, Sonepat. 7.11.2016. Renu & others Vs. Harish & others 19 Photocopy of driving licence Ex.R13 is shown to be issued by Licencing Authority, Manipur. Respondent No.1 Harish produced this licence in the court on 10.7.2016 for the first time. Although, this licence could not be verified from concerned Licencing Authority, yet, its genuineness is doubtful, because, this licence is shown to be issued on 04.01.2013. Why this licence was not handed over to Investigating Officer during investigation of criminal case registered against respondent No.1? Why this licence was not given to respondent No.2 owner of offending vehicle? There is no reply. This licence was produced in the court when both the licences produced by respondent No.1 and respondent No.2 were found fake. These facts have created doubt about validity of licence Ex.R13. Moreover, there will be no end if respondent No.1 is allowed to produce his driving licence one after the other. Therefore, it is clear that respondent No.1 driver of offending vehicle had no valid licence at the time of accident. Hence, respondent No.1 driver and respondent No.2 owner of offending vehicle are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the claimants. 27.It is also not out of place to mention here that Hon'ble Apex Court has laid down in number of cases that even if licence of driver is fake, still insurer would remain liable to pay the compensation to the petitioners and the insurer is entitled to recover the said amount from driver and owner of offending vehicle. Accordingly, respondent No.3 Insurance Company is under statutory obligation to pay the compensation amount to the claimants and it can recover the said amount from respondent No.1 driver and from respondent No.2 owner of offending vehicle as per law.

SUNITA GROVER, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT MACT case No. 41 of 2015 Date of Instt. 23.07.2015 Date of decision: 03.08.2016 CIS No.MACP-364/2015 Bhateri wife of Munshi, aged 40 years, resident of Ganda Nala near Adrash Nagar, Sonepat ….Petitioner Versus 1. Prag Raj son of Prem Veer, resident of House No. 1307/31 Shastri Colony, Gohana Road, Sonepat (Driver and owner of car bearing registration No. HR10R-2404) 2. TATA AIG General Insurance Company Limited Office at First Floor Community Center Lotus Tower, New Friends Colony, New Delhi (Insurer of car bearing registration No. HR10R-2404) …Respondents CLAIM PETITION UNDER SECTION 166 OF MOTOR VEHICLES ACT ARGUED BY Shri Dalbir Singh Dahiya counsel for the petitioner Shri Parveen Rathee counsel for respondent no.1 Shri Hukam Chand Jain and Sh. Nitin Jain counsels for respondent no.2 AWARD This claim petition has been filed by petitioner, seeking compensation to the tune of Rs. 7,00,000/- with interest at the rate of 24% MACT case No. 41 of 2015 Bhateri Vs. Pragraj and another per annum severally and jointly from respondents on account of injuries suffered by her in the motor vehicular accident that took place on 13.07.2013 at about 05.30 p.m. As per petitioner, on this date she was going to market to fetch milk and when she reached near Bawa Cinema, Sonepat, the offending car driven by its driver respondent no. 1 at very high and fast speed and without caring for the traffic rules and without blowing any horn came from back side and hit her and caused the accident. As a result of which, the petitioner sustained multiple and grievous injuries. Petitioner was shifted to Civil Hospital, Sonipat. FIR no. 309 dated 15.07.2013 under sections 279 and 337 IPC was registered at Police Station, Civil Lines, Sonepat. It is pleaded that the injured / petitioner incurred the amount of Rs. 30,000/- on her treatment, transportation, special diet, attendant etc. The above said accident took place only due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 1. The petitioner / injured is a labourer and she was earning Rs. 9,000/- per month. But due to this accident, petitioner suffered loss of work, income and during the period of treatment she had no source of income for her livelihood and for her family. Therefore, she has claimed compensation of Rs. 7 lacs from respondents. 2 MACT case No. 41 of 2015 Bhateri Vs. Pragraj and another 2.On notice respondent no. 1 appeared through his counsel and resisted the claim petition by filing separate written statement. 3.On merits, respondent no.1 denied the manner of the accident stating that no such accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the car by respondent no. 1 and pleaded that in fact, the claimant / petitioner was walking on the metalled portion of the road and without observing traffic rules and a false case has been registered against respondent no. 1 and that the amount of compensation claimed is on higher side. It is denied that the petitioner is entitled to compensation, however in alternative it is pleaded by respondent no.1 that if, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the accident took place with the offending vehicle, which was duly insured with respondent No.2, it will be for the said respondent to pay the compensation and a prayer for dismissal of the petition is made. 4.Respondent no. 2 – TATA AIG General insurance Company Limited in its written statement took preliminary objections that no such accident took place involving the car no. HR10-R-2404 and if accident is proved, then there was rashness and negligence on the part of claimant herself and that the driver of the alleged vehicle was not holding a valid and effective driving licence to drive the alleged vehicle at the time of 3 MACT case No. 41 of 2015 Bhateri Vs. Pragraj and another alleged accident. On merits also respondent no.2 denied the case of the petitioner and pleaded that the respondent no. 2 is not liable to indemnify the award. As per respondent no.2, the claim is exorbitant and imaginary and hence dismissal of the petition has been prayed for. 5.From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed on 19.07.2016 - 1.Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle bearing Registration No. HR10R-2404 by its driver- respondent no. 1 on 13.07.2013 at about 05.30 p.m. in the area of Police Station Civil Lines, Sonepat, resulting into injuries to Bhateri, as alleged ? OPP 2.Whether the petitioner is entitled to get the compensation ? If so, to what amount and from whom ? OPP 3.Whether respondent no.1 was not holding valid and effective driving licence on the date and time of alleged accident. If so to what effect ? OPR 4.Relief. 6.In her evidence, petitioner Bhateri appeared as PW1 and examined Krishan as PW2. Thereafter, learned counsel for petitioner closed the evidence after tendering documents.4 MACT case No. 41 of 2015 Bhateri Vs. Pragraj and another 7.Learned counsel for respondent no. 1 tendered documents Ex. R1 to Ex. R3 and closed the evidence on behalf of respondent no. 1. No evidence was led by respondent no. 2. 8.I have appraised the evidence on record, material circumstances of the case and the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the parties. My findings on the aforesaid issues along with the reasons thereof are as under - ISSUE NO.1 9.In support of this issue, petitioner Bhateri as PW1 has reiterated her stand taken in the petition. She has deposed completely on the lines of the petition regarding the manner in which the accident took place, the injuries sustained by her and the expenses incurred on her treatment. PW2 Krishan has also corroborated the version of petitioner. 10.Learned counsel for petitioner has submitted that the FIR proves the accident caused due to rash and negligent driving by respondent no. 1 and in view of the evidence led, petitioner is entitled to the relief claimed in the petition. 11.Learned counsel for respondent no. 2 on the other side argued that petitioner did not notice the registration number of the car as stated by her in her cross-examination and PW2 Krishan also admitted 5 MACT case No. 41 of 2015 Bhateri Vs. Pragraj and another that the accident did not take place in his presence and he did not notice the registration number of the car. He argued that there is no eye witness of the accident and the FIR was registered after delay of two days and there is also no evidence of treatment of petitioner on record. Therefore, in view of the evidence on record, rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent no.1 is not established. 12.The petitioner has also proved the certified copy of FIR Ex. P2 and discharge card Ex. P5. The FIR Ex. P2 registered on 15.07.2013 regarding the accident dated 13.07.2013 mentions the registration number of the offending vehicle and as per FIR the driver of the offending vehicle fled away along with his car. It is specifically recorded in the FIR that accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of the driver of the offending vehicle. Respondent no. 1 in his written statement has pleaded that the accident took place only due to rashness and negligence of injured and respondent no. 1 denied rash and negligent driving on his part. In this way, respondent no. 1 has admitted the accident to have taken place but respondent no.1 has not stepped into the witness box to state his case on oath and to offer himself for cross examination. There is also no evidence on the file that respondent no.1 ever filed any protest petition before the higher authorities against false 6 MACT case No. 41 of 2015 Bhateri Vs. Pragraj and another implication or against false involvement of the vehicle and his silence for such a long period also goes against him. The only irresistible conclusion that can be drawn is that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent no.1 while driving the offending vehicle. 13Reference may further be made to United India Insurance Company Ltd. Vs Meena and others II (2010) ACC 935 (DB), wherein it is observed that the proceedings before the Tribunal are of summary nature, and only for the purpose of determination of compensation, therefore, the documents prepared by the police may be taken on its face value. 14.It is settled law that if a party does not appear in the witness box, an adverse inference is liable to be drawn against such a party. Reference, in this regard, may be made to Iswar Bhai C.Patel @ Bachu Bhai Patel Vs Harihar Behera and another 1999(2) LJR 129 wherein it is held that if a party does not enter into witness box, an adverse inference is drawn against that party.7 MACT case No. 41 of 2015 Bhateri Vs. Pragraj and another 15.It is the specific case of petitioner that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent no.1. Even if, no eye witness is examined by petitioner and there is two days delay in registration of FIR, petitioner herself being injured is the eye witness and the FIR mentions about the information of the accident received at Police Control Room on 13.07.2013 on which police official reached at the hospital and received the MLR of the petitioner and found petitioner referred to PGIMS, Rohtak. On which police official reached at PGIMS, Rohtak on 14.07.2013 and found injured discharged from the hospital and thereafter on 15.07.2013, he reached at the house of petitioner and recorded her statement. The copy of MLR is also available on record. The documents and the statement of petitioner do not leave any scope for doubt regarding the involvement of the offending vehicle, especially when the registration number of the offending vehicle is specifically mentioned in the first information report itself and respondent no.1 did not adhere to the required precautions for safe driving. 16. Hence, in view of the evidence led it is established that the accident on 13.07.2013 was caused due to rash and negligent driving by 8 MACT case No. 41 of 2015 Bhateri Vs. Pragraj and another respondent no.1 whereby petitioner sustained injuries. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of petitioner and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.2 17.On the aspect of the quantum of compensation, the petitioner has categorically deposed that she sustained multiple and grievous injuries and after the accident she was taken to Civil Hospital Sonepat, where she was medico-legally examined and thereafter, she was shifted to PGIMS, Rohtak and as per petitioner, she is still under treatment and the expenses of more than Rs. 30,000/- were incurred on her treatment, transportation, special diet, attendant etc. 18.Learned counsel for petitioner tendered the documents / bills Ex. P1, Ex. P3 to Ex. P5. Ex. P1 is the visiting card of Mukesh Spine Theraphy, Ex. P3 is the bill of Rs. 1950/-, Ex. P4 is the attendant's pass of claimant / petitioner and Ex. P5 is the follow up and discharge card issued by PGIMS, Rohtak. The bill Ex. P3 is without name of the injured. However, Follow up and discharge card Ex. P5 shows that petitioner was admitted in PGIMS Rohtak on 13.07.2013 and was discharged on 14.07.2013 and therefore, petitioner must have spent some amount on transportation and special diet etc. Thus, a sum of Rs. 7,000/- is assessed as total compensation in lump sum to the petitioner. 9 MACT case No. 41 of 2015 Bhateri Vs. Pragraj and another 19.The point now arises as to who is liable to pay the compensation. The respondent no.1 was having a valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident and his driving licence is proved as Ex. R1. The vehicle is registered in the name of respondent no. 1 and the registration certificate is proved as Ex. R2. The vehicle was insured with respondent no.2 and the insurance policy is proved as Ex. R2. Hence insurer i.e. respondent no. 2 – TATA AIG General Insurance Company Limited also cannot escape from its liability. Consequently, both the respondent no. 1 and 2 are held liable jointly and severally to pay the compensation to the petitioner. Accordingly, this issue stands decided in favour of petitioner and against respondents. ISSUE NO.3 20.The onus to prove this issue was upon the respondents. In view of findings on the preceding issues and the evidence on record, it is established that respondent no.1 was holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident. Hence, this issue has become redundant. ISSUE NO. 4 (RELIEF) 21.Consequent upon the findings on preceding issues, present petition is accepted partly with costs. Both respondents are jointly and severally held liable to pay compensation of Rs. 7,000/- (Rs. Seven 10 MACT case No. 41 of 2015 Bhateri Vs. Pragraj and another Thousand only) to the petitioner, alongwith interest @ 7% per annum on the amount of compensation from the date of filing of the petition till realization payable by respondents. However, if the said amount is not deposited within three months of passing of the award, respondents shall be liable to pay interest @ 8% per annum on the amount of compensation, till payment. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.1100/-. Memo of costs be prepared and file be consigned to the record room. Announced.

Post mortem of dead body was got conducted in General Hospital, Sonepat. At the time of accident, the age of the deceased was 28 years and he was employed by Ranbir Singh son of Zile Singh for agricultural pursuits and earning Rs.12,000/- per month.

The answering respondent has taken all the defences under Sections 134(C), 147, 149, 157 and 170 of M.V . Act. On merits, it has denied the factum of accident as stated in the petition and averred that the deceased was not 28 years old nor he was allegedly employed by Ranbir for agricultural pursuits. It was denied that deceased was drawing Rs.12,000/- per month. In fact, no alleged accident had taken place and the FIR No.357 dated 21.10.2014 is a procured document and a false case has been got registered against respondent No.1 in order to extract compensation from it. The insurance company has alleged the amount Rubey & others Vs. Dayanand & others. 5 of compensation to be excessive and exorbitant. Some additional pleas have also been taken by respondent No.3 to the effect that respondent No.1 was not having a valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident and alleged offending vehicle was being plied without having a valid registration certificate, permit and fitness certificate at the relevant time and place.

Onus to prove this issue was upon the petitioners. Under this issue, the petitioners were required to prove that on 21.10.2014 at about 4.30 A.M., an accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle i.e. Dumpher bearing No.HR-69/8647 by its driver respondent No.1 and caused injuries to Sandeep due to which he died. Rubey & others Vs. Dayanand & others. 8 In order to prove this issue, petitioner Krishan Lal appeared in the witness-box as PW1 and tendered his duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW1/A in his evidence and deposed that on 21.10.2014 at about 4.30 A.M., his sons Sanjay and deceased Sandeep were working with Ranbir son of Zile Singh and when said Ranbir was going to his fields by driving tractor-trolley and at that time, Sanjay and Sandeep were travelling in trolley, offending vehicle came from rear side and dashed trolley attached with tractor near the house/fields of Ishwar son of Bhalle Ram and in this accident, Sandeep died. . He spent Rs.80,000/- on funeral and last rites of deceased. Ranbir Singh appeared in the witness-box as PW2 and tendered his duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW2/A in his evidence and deposed that he is an agriculturist and deceased Sandeep was employed with him till his death. On 21.10.2014 at abut 4.30 A.M., deceased Sandeep and his brother Sanjay, Shamsher and Sukhbir were going to his fields by tractor bearing No.HR- 10W/6853 and deceased Sandeep and his brother Sanjay were travelling in Trolley attached with tractor and when tractor reached near house of Ishwar son of Bhalle Ram, then Dumpher bearing registration No.HR-69-8647 came from rear side driven by rashly and negligently and on a high speed and dashed the trolley as a result of which Trolley turned turtle and Sandeep Rubey & others Vs. Dayanand & others. 9 sustained fatal injuries and died at the spot. On his information, police reached at the spot and recorded statement of Sanjay, brother of deceased, on the basis of which FIR No.357 under Sections 279/304A IPC was registered. He further deposed that deceased was drawing Rs.12,000/- per month. Claimant Rubey appeared into witness-box as PW3 and tendered her duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW3/A whereby she reiterated the averments made in the claim petition and deposed that she is widow of deceased Sandeep who died on 21.10.2014 at about 4.30 A.M. in a roadside accident caused by respondent No.1 by driving offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. She has further deposed that FIR No.357 under Sections 279/304A IPC was registered against respondent No.1. Dr. Sudesh Kumar, Medical Officer, General Hospital, Sonepat performed post mortem examination. She has also deposed that they spent a sum of Rs.80,000/- on funeral and last rites of deceased. Sanjay while appearing into witness-box as PW4 has tendered in evidence his duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW4/A and he deposed on the line of PW2 Ranbir. He further stated that FIR No.357 dated 21.10.2014 under Sections 279/304A IPC was registered on his statement recorded by the police. Rubey & others Vs. Dayanand & others. 10 PW5 Samunder Singh, Criminal Ahalmad, has brought summoned record regarding FIR NO.357 dated 21.10.2014 titled as State Vs. Dayanand and proved report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. as PW5/A and site plan as Ex.PW5/B. All the witnessed were cross-examined at length but nothing could be come out to show that the accident had not taken place in the manner as alleged and deposed by this witnesses. Further, it is apparent that FIR Ex.PW5/D under Sections 279/304A IPC resulted into prosecution of respondent No.1 Daya Nand and vide report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex.PW5/A, a prosecution was launched against him. Copy of rough site plan of place of occurrence Ex.PW5/B and copy of PMR Ex.P1 are also produced on case file. These facts are themselves sufficient corroboration to testimony of witnesses. As against this cogent oral as well as documentary evidence regarding the manner of accident, no evidence whatsoever has been produced by the respondents. The respondent no.1 has not stepped into the witness-box to rebut the allegations and the evidence led by the petitioners. It is settled law that where driver of offending vehicle does not come forward to deny his negligence, there is a presumption that the claim of the claimant is correct. In this regard, reliance may be placed upon the law laid down in Raju & others Rubey & others Vs. Dayanand & others. 11 Vs. Sukhvinder Singh and others, 2006(4) RCR(Civil) page 82 . Moreover, had respondent No.1 Dayanand being falsely implicated in the criminal case, then he would have filed complaint to higher authorities regarding his false involvement, but, no such complaint is shown to have been filed. In view of my above discussions and reasonings and in the light of law discussed above, this Tribunal reached at the conclusion that said accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1 being its driver, due to which, Sandeep expired. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners and against the respondents. I SSUE No.2 - 13.Petitioners have claimed a compensation of Rs.20 lacs on account of death of Sandeep in the accident in question. PW1 Krishan Lal and PW3 Rubey have deposed that the age of deceased was 28 years at the time of his death and this fact further finds corroboration from post mortem report Ex.P1, in which, the age of deceased is also recorded as 28 years, so, the age of deceased will be taken as 28 years at the time of accident in question. Claimants have asserted that deceased was earning Rs.12,000/- per Rubey & others Vs. Dayanand & others. 12 month by doing labour work in the fields of Ranbir Singh son of Zile Singh and said Ranbir Singh while appearing into witness box has deposed that Sandeep was working in his fields at the time of death and was drawing Rs.12,000/- per month. However, their oral testimony are not sufficient to prove the earnings of deceased. They have not produced agreement or other documentary evidence to prove that deceased was taking Rs.12,000/- per month from Ranbir Singh. There is no iota of proof on case file to prove the earnings of deceased Sandeep. However, it is admitted fact that deceased Sandeep was unskilled labourer and it can safely be assumed that the deceased must have been earning minimum wage which was about Rs.6000/- per month at the time of accident. Therefore, it is presumed that deceased was earning Rs.6000/- per month at the time of accident. In view of law laid down by the Hon'ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana in case titled as Rajesh Vs. Rajbir etc., 2013, ACJ, 1403 , 50% income of the deceased is to be added for future prospectus, as the age of deceased was 28 years at the time of accident in question. Therefore, the income of deceased is presumed to be Rs.9000/- per month (Rs.6000/- + Rs.3000/-) and annual income of deceased comes to Rs.1,08,000/- (Rs. One lac eight thousand only). There are three petitioners and as per judicial pronouncement reported Rubey & others Vs. Dayanand & others. 13 in Sarla Verma & Ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & others, 2009(3) RCR (Civil) page 77(SC), 1/3rd of the total income of deceased is to be deducted on account of personal expenses of the deceased and after deducting 1/3rd income of deceased towards his personal expenses, income of deceased comes to Rs.72,000/- (1,08,000-36000) per annum. Age of deceased was 28 years at the time of his death. In view of law laid down in Sarla Verma's case (supra) , the multiplier of '17' is applicable. By applying the multiplier of 17, total compensation comes to Rs.12,24,000/- (72,000/- x 17) (Rs.twelve lacs twentyfour thousand only). In addition to this, petitioners are also entitled to Rs.25,000/- on account of consortium for love and affection and Rs.5000/- for the expenses spent on last rites and total amount of compensation comes to Rs.12,54,000/- (Rs.twelve lacs fiftyfour thousand only). The next question to be determined is as to by whom, the compensation is to be paid? From the photocopy of insurance policy Ex.R3, it stands proved on record that the offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.3 i.e. insurance company w.e.f. 29.08.2014 to midnight on 28.08.2015, whereas the accident in question took place on 21.10.2014. Thus, the liability to make the payment shall be joint and several of all the Rubey & others Vs. Dayanand & others. 14 respondents, but, ultimately liability of payment lies with respondent No.3 as offending vehicle was insured with it and respondent No.3 is bound to indemnify respondent No.2, the registered owner of offending vehicle. Accordingly, issue No.2 is decided in favour of petitioners. Issue No.3:- 14.Onus to prove this issue was upon the respondents. Respondent No.1 has produced photocopy of his driving licence as Ex.R1 in evidence and perusal of the same reveals that it is valid for driving H.T.V and H.P.V . It was issued on 22.10.2013 and date of expiry is 21.10.2016. In this way, driving licence Ex.R1 was valid on the day of this accident. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the respondent No.1. RELIEF :- 15.In view of the findings of this Tribunal returned on issues under adjudication, present claim petition succeeds and same is hereby accepted with costs. The petitioners are awarded a compensation to the tune of Rs.12,54,000/- (Rs.twelve lacs fiftyfour thousand only) with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of filing of petition till the date of realization. Out of total amount of Rs.12,54,000/-, an amount of Rs.7,54,000/- is granted to petitioner No.1 Rubey, out of which, an amount of Rs.2,54,000/- to be paid to Rubey & others Vs. Dayanand & others. 15 her in cash to meet the daily expenses and remaining amount of Rs.5,00,000/- shall be deposited in the shape of FDRs in her name in any nationalized bank of her choice for a period of one year, whereas the petitioners No.2 and 3 namely Krishan Lal and Saroja are entitled to receive Rs.2,50,000/- each with proportionate interest accrue thereon, out of which, an amount of Rs.50,000/- each to be paid to claimants No.2 and 3 in cash and remaining amount of Rs.2,00,000/- each shall be deposited in the shape of FDRs in their names in any nationalized bank of their choice for a period of one year.

But Sunil and Deepanshu were got admitted in Tulip Hospital for immediate treatment, where Sunil succumbed to the injuries on 27.09.015 at 10.55 p.m. On the statement of Deepak the FIR No.172 dated 28.09.2015 was registered under Sections 304-A, 279, 337 IPC in P.S.Mohana, District Sonipat. 3. It has been further alleged that the complainant spent Rs.70,000/- on medicines, treatment and hospitalization in Tulip Hospital and Rs.80,000 on funeral and last rights of the deceased. At the (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Nirmala versus Suresh etc.. MACP No.584 of 2015 -3- time of accident, the deceased was aged about 24 years. He was hail and hearty and was working as attendant/helper on the Kiryana/grocery shop of Sandeep and earning monthly salary of Rs.15,000/- p.m. He was contributing whole of his income to the claimant being real mother and fully dependent upon the support and income of deceased. The claimant being legal heir of her son is entitled to the compensation claimed. 4.The above mentioned claim petition has been contested by the respondents. The respondent No.1 has opposed the claim petition by filing written statement, taking preliminary objections that the petition is not maintainable in its present form and the petitioner has no cause of action. On merits, it has been averred that no accident took place because of negligent act on the part of respondent. It is, however, pleaded that the police without verifying the true facts arrested respondent No.1 after the accident. It has been alleged that the accident took place because of car driver who was driving his swift car No.HR-06E-2475 in a rash and negligent manner in a very high speed and without observing the traffic rules and hit his car in front of the bus by taking a wrong side. The respondent No.1 was driving his bus at a moderate speed by observing all the traffic rules. The FIR is based on wrong facts. However, the respondent No.1 has taken an alternative plea and alleged that vehicle was otherwise insured with respondent No.3 and if any responsibility to pay compensation arises, the same has to be indemnified by the respondent No.3, being insurer of the offending vehicle. He was having a valid and effective driving licence. 5.Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 owner of Haryana Roadways Bus (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Nirmala versus Suresh etc.. MACP No.584 of 2015 -4- have also opposed the claim petition on the ground that the accident had taken place due to sole negligence on the part of Swift car driver bearing No. HR06E-2475 (since deceased) who was driving his car in high speed, rashly and negligently in which Sunil son of claimant Nirmla was travelling. Respondent No.1 was not at fault and police has falsely implicated the respondent No.1. Respondent No.2 and 3 are not liable to pay any amount of compensation to the claimants. 6.The respondent No.4 Insurance Company, has also contested the above mentioned claim petition on the ground that driver of bus No. HR-39A-6147 was not holding any valid and effective driving licence and the bus was being driven without registration certificate, route permit and fitness certificate and as such as per the terms of police respondent No.4 is not liable to pay any compensation. Respondent No.2 did not give information about accident as per section 134(C) of M.V . Act. The accident had taken place due to sole negligence of driver of Swift Car bearing No.HR06E-2475 which was being driven by Sunil in a high speed,rashly and negligent manner. It is also submitted that there is unexplained delay of one day in lodging FIR and as such the case is planted one and thus respondent No.4 is not liable to pay any compensation. 7.On the basis of above mentioned pleadings of the parties, for adjudication, following issues were framed in this case:- (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Nirmala versus Suresh etc.. MACP No.584 of 2015 -5- 1) Whether the accident took place on 27.9.2015 at about 4.00 p.m. in the area of P. S. Mohana due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle bearing registration No. HR-69A-6147 by its driver/respondent No.1, resulting into death of Sunil, as alleged? OPP 2)Whether the petitioners are entitled to get the compensation? If so to what amount and from whom?OPP 3)Whether the respondent No.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence on the date and at the time of alleged accident , if so, its effect? OPR 4)Relief. 8.In support of his claim the claimant has examined PW-1 Nirmla, PW-2 Deepak,. PW-3 Jaideep and PW-4 EHC Rajbir Singh. 9.On the other hands, no evidence was adduced by the respondent No.1 and 4. The respondent No.2&3, in their evidence, have placed on record copy of insurance policy Ex.R-1, copy of route permit Ex.R2, copy of registration certificate of the offending vehicle Ex.R-3, copy of fitness certificate Ex. R4, and copy of driving licence of the respondent No.1 Ex.R-5. 10.I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record carefully. My issue-wise findings are as under:- ISSUE NO.1 11.The burden to prove this issue was upon the petitioner and in order to discharge onus on her part, petitioner examined PW2 Deepak, author of FIR who supported the case of claimant on oath. PW-2 Deepak deposed (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Nirmala versus Suresh etc.. MACP No.584 of 2015 -6- that on 27.9.2015 JotiSarup and Deepanshu boaded Swift car bearing No. HR- 06-E-2475 driven by his younger brother Sunil whereas he and his maternal uncle Jaideep boarded another car. The car driven by his brother Sunil was ahead of their car. At about 4.00 PM when they reached near turning of Karewari on Sonipat Gohana Road, a Haryana Roadways bus bearing No. HR-69A-6147 came from Sonipat side driven by respondent No.1 in rash and negligent manner at high speed hit car No. HR-06E-2475. Car was damaged and its occupant Sunils, Deepanshu and Jyoti Sarup sustained grievous multiple injuries. Injured were taken to Khanpur PGI for treatment from where Sunil was referred to PGIMS, Rohtak. But they took Sunil to Tulip hospital, Sonipat where he was admitted but Sunil succumbed to injuries during treatment. Further, claimant appeared as PW-1 and tendered her affidavit Ex.PW-1/A, thereby reiterating the averments made in the claim petition. PW-4 EHC Rajbir produced copy of FIR bearing No.172 dated 28.9.2015 Ex. PW4/A. 12. To rebut the claim of the petitioner qua negligence of respondent No.1 in causing the accident in question, respondents have led no evidence. However, in documentary evidence the respondent No.2 and 3 tendered documents Ex. R1 insurance certificate, Ex. R2 route permit, Ex. R3 RC, Ex. R4 certificate of fitness and Ex. R5 DL of Suresh Kumar. 13. It is settled law that it is the entire responsibility of the claimant to establish that the driver of the offending vehicle was driving the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner, which resulted into the accident. Further, with regard to standard of proof, it has been held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Nirmala versus Suresh etc.. MACP No.584 of 2015 -7- Parmeshwari Devi vs. Amir Chand and others, 2011(2) RCR (Civil)153, that in a claim pertaining to a road accident, the strict principles of proof of a criminal case are not attracted and that the claimants are merely to establish their case on the touch-stone of preponderance of probabilities. 14. From the evidence on record the claimant has succeeded in establishing that on 27.9.2015 the offending vehicle was being driven by respondent No.1 in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident in question. PW2 Deepak duly d eposed about the manner of accident, which finds corroboration vide Ex.PW4/A copy of FIR. The deposition of PW-2 qua negligence of the driver of the offending vehicle remained unshaked and undoubted. Further, from the perusal of Ex.PW4/A it transpires that the name of the driver of the offending vehicle and number of the offending vehicle has been specifically mentioned in the FIR. Had the accident not been caused by negligent driving of respondent No.1, then there would have been no reason on the part of PW-2 to lodge the FIR and to appear as a witness against him. 15.Though respondent No.1 has taken specific plea in the reply that said accident took place due to negligence on the part of the deceased, however he has failed to fortify his assertion and failed to rebut the testimony of the witnesses. H ad the accident not taken place as alleged by the petitioner, respondent No.1 would certainly have made complaints to the higher authorities regarding false implication of the offending vehicle with regard to the accident, but no such event happened. Therefore, the evidence coming on record proves rash and negligent driving of Bus No. HR-69A-6147 by respondent No. 1 causing the accident in question. This Tribunal does not see (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Nirmala versus Suresh etc.. MACP No.584 of 2015 -8- any reason to disbelieve the evidence produced by the petitioner. In such circumstances, it is held that petitioner has proved that the accident in question had been caused due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No.1 . This issue is accordingly decided in favour of petitioner and against the respondent. ISSUES NO.2 & 3 16. Both these issues are inter-linked and inter-connected, therefore, the same are being taken up together for disposal. 17. It has been argued on behalf of the claimant that deceased was 24 years of age at the time of accident and was earning Rs.15,000/- per month by doing private job with PW-3 Jaldeep, Kiryana merchant/shopkeeper at Murthal, District Sonipat. Learned counsel for the claimant also referred to the statement of PW-1 Nirmala, mother of deceased, who has categorically deposed that she was fully dependent upon the income of the deceased and now, she has no source of income. Learned counsel for the claimant has further relied upon testimony of PW-3 Jaideep, who deposed that he is running grocery shop at Murthal and Sunil was working at his shop and drawing monthly salary of Rs. 15000/-. He proved the document i.e. Ex. PW3/B salary certificate. Claimant has further claimed that the claimant has spent a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- on treatment and last rites of the deceased. It is submitted that the loss of income be fairly compensated to the dependent of deceased. 18. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents prayed for (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Nirmala versus Suresh etc.. MACP No.584 of 2015 -9- only assessing just compensation to the claimant. It is argued that the income of deceased Sunil as Rs.15,000/- per month claimed by the claimant is exaggerated. No reliable evidence has been brought on record to prove his aforesaid income from his alleged work. Therefore, it is submitted that at best, the monthly income of Sunil can be taken as that of a daily wage earner and multiplier be adopted accordingly. 19. After having heard learned counsel on behalf of all the parties and perusing the record carefully, it may be observed that the procedure before the tribunal is summary procedure and any document having some probative value and the genuineness of which is not in doubt can be looked into by the Tribunal for getting preponderance of probable version. Reliance in this regard can be placed upon New India Assurance Company Vs. Saloni Dargan and others 1990 ACJ 127. 20. Hon'ble Supreme court in case of R.D.Hattangadi Vs Pest Control (India) Pvt.Ltd.1995 ACJ 366(SC) has observed that broadly speaking while fixing an amount of compensation payable to a victim of an accident, the damages have to be assessed separately as pecuniary damages and special damages. Pecuniary damages are those which the victim has actually incurred and which are capable of being calculated by arithmetic calculation. In order to appreciate two concepts, pecuniary damages may include expenses incurred by the claimant(i) medical attendance(ii) loss of earning of profit upto date of trial and (iii) other material loss. So far as non pecuniary damages are concerned, they may be suffered in future(ii) damages to compensate for the loss of amenities of life which may include a variety of (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Nirmala versus Suresh etc.. MACP No.584 of 2015 -10- matters I.e on account of injury the cliamant may not be able to walk, run or sit(iii) damages for the loss of expectation of life i.e. on account of injury the normal longevity of the person concerned is shortened and (iv) inconvenience, hardship, discomfort, disappointment, frustration and mental stress in life. 21. As per the statements of PW-1 Nirmala at the time of death, deceased Sunil was 24 years of age, in copy of postmortem examination report Ex.P1 also age of Sunil is 24 years at the time of his death. Thus, it is held that the deceased was 24 years of age at the time of accident. Thereafter, as per observations of Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in case Sarla Verma and others Vs Delhi Transport Corporation and another 2009(3) RCR (Civil) 77, multiplier of 18 should be adopted. 22. Now coming to the dependency, claimant Nirmala is mother of deceased. PW-1 Nirmala has categorically deposed that she being mother was fully dependent upon the income and support of deceased Sunil. Thus, the claimant being legal heirs and dependent of the deceased is held entitled to get compensation for his death in the ill-fated accident. 23. Claimant and witness Jaideep deposed that Sunil was working as helper in the grocery store at Murthal and placed on record salary certificate of deceased Sunil as Ex.PW3/B, however, in his cross-examination he stated that he has no documentary proof regarding employment of deceased with him and further he has not shown the salary of deceased in income tax. He admitted that he never obtained receipt of salary of from deceased and never maintained any record of employment and salary of (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Nirmala versus Suresh etc.. MACP No.584 of 2015 -11- deceased which can proved that deceased was working with him. Thus, he failed to prove the factum of service of deceased Sunil with him in accordance with law. Thus, it is clearly made out that there is no evidence placed on record that deceased Sunil was engaged or serving as helper in the grocery shop and getting Rs. 15,000/- as salary. 24. The evidence produced by the claimant regarding income and employment of Sunil deceased does not appear to be believable and his salary appears to be highly exorbitant. Accordingly, it is assumed that deceased Sunil might have earn Rs.6,000/- per month by doing some work for his livelihood. In view of law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Rajesh and others Vs. Rajbir Singh and others 2013 9 SCC 54 50% of income is to be added as future prospectus. Therefore, monthly income of the deceased is presumed to be Rs.9,000/-. Undisputedly, deceased was unmarried and was 24 years of age, so he would be contributing half of the income towards expenses of the family, thus dependency of the petitioner comes out to be Rs.54,000/- (Rs.4500x 12) per annum. As has already been noticed, deceased was unmarried and aged about 24 years of age, hence in view of law laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Sarla Verma and Others Versus Delhi Transport Corporation and another, 2009 ACJ 1298, multiplier of 18 shall be applicable and by taking the said multiplier into consideration, the amount of compensation comes to be Rs.9,72,000/-. Hence the petitioner is held entitled to compensation of Rs. 9,72,000/-. 25. The head 'Funeral Expenses' does not mean the fee paid in the crematorium or fee paid for the use of space in the cemetery. There are many (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Nirmala versus Suresh etc.. MACP No.584 of 2015 -12- other expenses in connection with funeral and, if the deceased is follower of any particular religion, there are several religious practices and conventions pursuant to death in a family. All those are quite expensive. Thus, in view of the same, the claimant is entitled to Rs.25,000/- on account of last rites and Rs.50,000/- on account of loss of love and affection. 26. Thus, the total amount of compensation is assessed at Rs.9,72,000/- + 25,000/- + 50,000/- = Rs.1047000/-, awarded to the claimant mother on account of death of deceased Sunil in the accident in question. 27. Now, it is to be seen as to who is responsible for compensating the claimant. It is argued by learned counsel for the respondent No.4 insurance company, that the respondent No.1 was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident. As such, there is infringement of the terms of policy and the insurance company is not liable for making any payment of compensation to the third party. However, it is pointed out by learned counsel for the claimant as well as the respondent No.1 that copy of valid driving licence Ex.R-5, copy of registration certificate Ex.R-1, copy of permit Ex. R2, copy of registration certificate Ex.P3 and copy of fitness certificate Ex. R4 have been placed on record. From perusal copy of driving licence Ex. R5 it stands proved on record that driving licence was valid upto 1.1.2018 and accident in question took placed on 27.9.2015. Driving licence Ex. R5 is meant for driving HTV and HPV only. Therefore, the insurance company cannot wriggle out of its liability to keep the owner indemnified. 28. There is nothing on record to suggest that the driving licence of the respondent no.1 was not proper. It was the duty of the insurance company (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Nirmala versus Suresh etc.. MACP No.584 of 2015 -13- to prove that the driver was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of the accident. Since insurance company has failed to discharge such onus, therefore, it is proved that the driver was holding a valid driving licence and there is no infringement of the terms of policy. Therefore, there remains no amount of ambiguity that the respondents No.1 to 4 shall remain jointly and severally liable to compensate the claimant for the amount of compensation assessed above. However, insurance company-respondent No.4 shall make full payment of the award amount of compensation to the claimant, being insurer of the offending vehicle i.e. Haryana Roadways bus bearing registration No.HR 69-A-6147. It is ordered accordingly. Both these issues are accordingly decided in favour of claimant and against the respondents. RELIEF 29. Consequent upon my findings on aforesaid issues, present petition is accepted partly with costs. The claimant Nirmala being mother of deceased is held entitled to a compensation of Rs.1047000/-, on account of death of Sunil in the motor accident in question. 30. The claimant is also allowed interest on the amount of compensation so awarded at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the date of payment, if the amount is deposited within two months of passing of the award, failing which respondents shall be liable to pay interest @ 9% per annum on the amount of compensation till payment. The respondents are directed to deposit the amount of compensation by way (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Nirmala versus Suresh etc.. MACP No.584 of 2015 -14- of cheque or bank drafts in the name of petitioner, if the bank account number and copy of passbook is supplied by the petitioner to the counsel for the respondent No.4. If the account number is not supplied by the petitioner to the counsel for the respondent No.4, the compensation amount would be deposited in this Tribunal by way of cheque or bank draft in the name of petitioner Nirmala. 31Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.2200/-.

Counsel for respondent no.3 argued that no accident took place by the vehicle of respondent no.1 i.e offending car bearing registration No.DL-3B-4596 and respondent no.1 has been falsely implicated in this case. 11.For the purpose of considering as to how the accident took place, this court has to analyze both oral as well as documentary evidence available on the record. 12In order to prove this issue, petitioner Rajpal stepped into the Rajpal vs Rupesh etc 6 witness box as PW1 and tendered his affidavit Ex. PW1/A reiterating the facts as mentioned in the petition and deposed that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving on the part of the respondent no.1 and due to said accident he has suffered great physical pain, and mental agony and he has become unable to do his routine work. Petitioner further deposed that after the accident, he was shifted to CHC Kharkhoda but due to his serious condition, he was referred to PGIMS Rohtak where he remained admitted and spent huge amount on his treatment, medicines, special diet and transportation etc. The petitioner has also placed reliance on copy of medical record Ex P3&4 and Ex P2 disability certificate . 13. A perusal of copy of the FIR/copy of report under section 173 Cr.PC Ex P1 shows that the case regarding the accident in question was registered on the basis of statement of Petitioner Rajpal. The version put forth in the first information report regarding the factum and manner of the accident is entirely in consonance with the statement of PW1 injured Rajpal. 14. A perusal of the copy of FIR Ex P1 reveals that the respondent no. 1 was driving the offending vehicle bearing registration no. DL 3B-4596 on the date of accident. Registration number of the offending vehicle has been mentioned in the FIR. 15Had the accident not taken place due to the rash and Rajpal vs Rupesh etc 7 negligent driving of the offending vehicle by the respondent no.1, then as a man of ordinary prudence, he must have approached the higher police authorities for cancellation of the case, but neither there are pleadings nor any evidence on record to show that any step was taken by him in this direction. This conduct on the part of the respondent no.1 of remaining silent goes against him. The evidence of PW1 clearly prove the fact that vehicle of respondent no.1 was involved in the accident. 16. In view of the fore-going discussion, I arrive at the conclusion that the accident in question resulting into injuries to petitioners took place due to the rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle bearing No.DL 3B-4596 by the respondent no.1. Hence, the issue no.1 is decided in favour of the petitioner. Issue No. 2: 17. Petitioner appeared in the witness box as PW1 and testified that after the accident he was shifted to CHC Kharkhoda but due to serious condition, he was shifted to PGIMS Rohtak where he got treatment and thereafter he was shifted to PGIMS Rohtak. He deposed that he received head injuries and spent huge amount on his treatment, medicines, special diet and transportation etc and he is still under treatment. Due to accident he became unable to perform his duty properly. He produced on record Medical record P3 and P4. He has Rajpal vs Rupesh etc 8 suffered physical as well mental agony besides suffering financial loss. But the petitioner has not placed on record any medical bill to show that he has spent huge amount on his treatment. The petitioner has only placed on record disability certificate Ex P2 and a perusal of disability certificate reveals that petitioner has suffered 1% permanent disability. He deposed that he was earning Rs 15,000/- per month. But the petitioner has not placed on record any document regarding his income. In the absence of which it cannot be said that he was earning Rs 15,000/- per month by his profession as mechanic. 18. From the afore-discussed evidence, it stands proved that petitioner suffered multiple injuries. A perusal of copy of medical record, reveals that the petitioner suffered grievous injuries on head including fracture etc. Therefore, there is no gainsaying that the petitioner is entitled to get compensation for the injuries sustained by him in the accident in question. 19 It is settled law that the Motor Vehicles Act is a welfare legislation. It has been promulgated to give relief to the injured of road side accidents. The contents of the petitions for claim are not to be substantiated strictly by the Indian Evidence Act in the like manner in cases concerning to civil as well as criminal nature. Therefore, the provisions concerning to valid exhibition of medical bills can be ignored, particularly when a representative of the hospital, where the medical store Rajpal vs Rupesh etc 9 is situated, has authenticated the same as has been done in the instant case. Therefore, the medical bills despite the objections raised by the opposite side can be considered for grant of compensation in favour of the petitioner. 20 The petitioner must have undergone the agony of physical as well as mental pain and sufferings on account of the injuries received in the accident. No hard and fast rule can perhaps be laid down for assessing the compensation for the pain and sufferings undergone by an injured. However, the nature of the injuries, parts of the body involved, the period of hospitalization, the period required for recovery from the injuries and age and socio-economic conditions of the injured can be the guiding factors. The petitioner must have spent the huge amount on the medicines /treatment etc. 21No evidence in rebuttal has been led by the respondents. However, keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case as well as the documents i.e. the medical bills, prescription slips regarding consultation the following reasonable amount of compensation is assessed to be paid to the petitioner : 1. Hospitalization including Rs.10,000/- attendant expenses/Loss of income. 2. Pain and sufferings Rs.5,000/- 3. Transportation, diet etc. Rs.5,000/- Rajpal vs Rupesh etc 10 4.For 1% permanent Rs 20,000/- Disability Total Rs.40, 000/- From the aforementioned discussion the petitioner is held entitled to get Rs. 40000- as compensation. Accordingly issue no.2 is decided in favour of the petitioner. ISSUE NO.3 & 4: 22. Ex P6 is driving license of respondent no.1, which shows that it was valid for driving motorcycle,LMV-NT, . No evidence was led by respondent No.3 insurance company to prove that offending vehicle was being driven by respondent No.1 in contravention of the terms and conditions of insurance policy. Copy of driving licence Ex P6 has been placed on record, from which, it stands proved on record that driving license was issued by Licensing Authority and the said driving licence is meant for driving Motorcycle, LMV-NT- car. Accordingly, these issues are decided against respondent No.3. LIABILITY; 23. It has been held under issues no.1 that the accident in question resulting into injuries to petitioner took place on account of rash and negligent driving of vehicle bearing No. DL3B-4596-V-1652 by respondent no.1. The vehicle in question was owned by respondent Rajpal vs Rupesh etc 11 no.2 and was insured with respondent no.3, vide insurance policy Ex P5 at the time of accident. Hence respondents no.1 to 3 are held liable to pay compensation to the petitioners on account of injuries suffered by the claimant in the said accident due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. However, as the vehicle was insured with respondent no.3 as per insurance policy Ex P5, therefore, first liability is of respondent no.3 to pay the amount of amount of compensation to the claimant. RELIEF; 24In view of the findings recorded under the aforesaid issues, the petitions are accepted partly with costs. The petitioner is held entitled to a total compensation of Rs. 40,000/- (Rs Forty thousand only) in respect of the injuries sustained by him in the accident in question and the resultant effects thereof. The respondents no.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation. As the vehicle is insured with respondent no.3, therefore, respondent no.3 is held liable to pay the amount of compensation to the petitioner. On realization of compensation amount alongwith interest, all the compensation amount be given to the petitioner in cash. 25.

Joginder & others 6 D.O.D. 17.01.2018 ISSUE NO. 1: 12.PW2 Yogender Singh has narrated the facts of the claim petition in his affidavit Ex.PW2/A. He has specifically deposed that the alleged offending vehicle was being driven in a rash and negligent manner by respondent No. 1 and he caused the accident due to his rash and negligent driving. He has also deposed that the police had registered the FIR No. 158 dated 21.04.2015 under Sections 279,338 IPC in police station, Rai, District Sonepat against the respondent No. 1. The petitioners have also placed on record the copy of FIR Ex.P23 which shows that, the police registered a case against respondent No. 1 for the offence punishable under Sections 279/338 IPC. The copy of the postmortem report shows that deceased Vijay Pal died due to injuries described in the report. The learned counsel for respondent No. 3 has argued that mere registration of criminal case does not establish the negligence of respondent No. 1. He has argued that PW2 Yoginder Pal is son of the deceased and his testimony is not believable because he is interested witness. He has also argued that the claimants have not examined the investigating officer of the case and therefore, it is not proved that the accident in question had taken place due to negligence of respondent No. 1. He has relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in case of Hira Singh vs. Rajpal 2016(2) PLR 122 and Balbir @ Leela vs. Vikas and others 2014(1) PLR 459. However, these authorities are not applicable in the present case because the facts of the IN MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT, PRESIDED OVER BY SUSHIL KUMAR, ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, SONEPAT.

Since the respondents have not produced any evidence, this Tribunal has no reason to disbelieve the evidence of petitioners. Therefore, issue No. 1 is decided in favour of petitioners. ISSUE NO. 2: 13.The petitioners have claimed that deceased was earning ₹ 35,000/- per month. The petitioners have not produced any documentary proof regarding income of the deceased. However, the petitioners have examined PW3 Rajender who deposed that he and his brother Mukhtiar Singh had given their land to deceased Vijay Pal for earning his livelihood and he used to earn 21,000/- per month from the same. He has further ₹ deposed that deceased used to run dairy and from that source he used to earn 15,000/- per month. The learned counsel for respondent No. 3 has argued₹ that the petitioners have not produced any evidence for proving that the deceased owned any agricultural land. He has also argued that even if the deceased had owned any agricultural land that must have been inherited by the claimants and therefore, it cannot be said that the claimants have suffered any loss of income. He has relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in case of Narender Kaur and others vs. Pawan Kumar and others 2012(1) PLR 602. In the case, deceased was agriculturist and his income was presumed to be 4800/- per month. In that ₹ case, the accident had taken place on 16.07.2008 whereas in the present IN MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT, PRESIDED OVER BY SUSHIL KUMAR, ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, SONEPAT. UID No. HR-0077 MACP/CIS No. 505 of 07.10.2015 Smt. Natho Devi & others Vs. Joginder & others 8 D.O.D. 17.01.2018 case, the accident took place on 21.04.2015. Keeping in view all facts and circumstances of the case, income of the deceased is presumed to be ₹ 8,000/- per month. Further, keeping in view the age of the deceased, 10% of the income is to be added for future prospects. Therefore, income of the deceased is presumed to be 88,00/- per month. There are four claimants ₹ and they have claimed that they were dependents on the deceased. But, petitioners no. 2 to 4 are major sons and daughter of the deceased and they can not be said to be dependents of the deceased. Therefore, his 1/3rd income is liable to be deducted for personal expenses. Therefore, loss of income comes to 5867/- per month which comes to 70404/- per annum. ₹ ₹ The age of the deceased was about 54 years and therefore, multiplier of 11 is applicable. By applying multiplier 11, total loss of income comes to ₹ 7,74,444/- only. 14.Besides, a sum of 15,000/- for funeral expenses, 40,000/- ₹ ₹ for loss of consortium and a sum of 15,000/- for loss of estate are also ₹ allowed to the petitioners. 15.In view of my above discussion, it is concluded that petitioners are entitled to compensation of 8,44,444/- only. Hence, issue No. 2 is also ₹ partly decided in favour of petitioners ISSUE NO. 3: 16.Onus to prove this issue is on the respondents.

Therefore, this issue is decided against the respondents being not pressed. RELIEF: 17.In view of my above discussion on the aforesaid issues, claim petition is partly allowed with no order as to costs in favour of petitioners and against respondents. It is held that petitioners are entitled to compensation of 8,44,444/- (eight lacs forty four thousands four hundred fourty four only), recoverable from respondents jointly and severally along with interest @ 7% per annum from the date of filing of petition till realisation. Out of total amount of compensation, the petitioner no. 1, who is wife of the deceased, is entitled to 70% share and petitioners No. 2 to. 4 , who are major sons and daughter of deceased, are entitled to 10% share each in the amount of compensation. 18.The respondents are directed to deposit the amount of compensation in the bank accounts of the petitioners if the bank accounts number along with copies of passbooks are supplied by the petitioners to the counsel for respondent no. 3 within 15 days. If the account numbers are not supplied within 15 days, the compensation would be deposited in this Tribunal within three months by way of cheques or bank drafts in the name of petitioners according to their shares failing which respondents would be liable to pay interest at the rate of 8% per annum with yearly rest from the IN MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT, PRESIDED OVER BY SUSHIL KUMAR, ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, SONEPAT.

Santosh etc. Vs. Superintend of Police etc. 6 D.O.D. 06.10.2016 that after investigation of the case, police filed challan against respondent No.1 for causing the accident in question by driving the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. Since respondents have not examined any witness in their evidence, this tribunal has no reason to disbelieve the evidence of petitioner. Therefore, this issue is decided in favour of petitioner. ISSUE NO. 2:- 14. The petitioners have claimed that the deceased was earning ₹ 25,000/- per month by running the business of supplying goods to grocery shops.

Keeping in view all facts and circumstances of the case, the income of the deceased is presumed to be ₹ 8,000/- per month which comes to 96,000/- per annum. In view of law ₹ laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Rajesh Vs. Rajbir 2013 ACJ 1403 , 50% of the income of the deceased is to be added towards future prospects. Therefore, annual loss of income of the deceased is presumed to be 1,44,000/- per annum. ₹ 16.Since the deceased was unmarried, half of his income is to be deducted towards his personal expenses. Therefore, annual loss of dependency comes to 72,000/- per annum only. ₹ 17.PW 1 Smt. Santosh Devi has deposed that the age of the deceased was about 26 years. Since the statement of PW 1 has remained unrebutted, I have no reason to disbelieve her statement. Therefore, multiplier of 17 is applicable in this case.

Madan and others .” 2.The claimants of main petition titled as Mukesh & others Vs. Madan and others, filed the claim petition on account of death of their son/brother Manish in a motor vehicular accident claiming compensation to the tune of Rs.60.00 lacs. The claim petition titled as Pooja & others Vs. Madan and others has been filed by the petitioners for compensation to the tune of Rs.60 lacs on account of death of their husband/father/son/brother Parveen in the accident in question. 3. While providing the particulars as required under the Motor Vehicles Act and the Rules framed thereunder, claimants inter alia alleged that on 6.12.2014, deceased Manish alongwith his father Jaipal, deceased Parveen son of Anand Parkash and father of deceased Parveen namely Anand Parkash were going from Murthal to village Ahmedpur, District Sonepat in offending vehicle Maruti Van No.DL-3C-AG-4412 in a Barat. Deceased Parveen was sitting with respondent No.1. Respondent No.1 was driving the offending vehicle at a high speed, rashly and negligently in a zig zag manner. Complainant/claimant Jai Pal asked respondent No.1 to drive vehicle at a moderate speed and carefully but respondent No.1 did not pay any heed. At about 10.15 PM when they reached in the area of near Gulia Petrol Pump, Delhi Road, Sonepat, respondent No.1 lost his control over vehicle and struck the same against the divider of the road and also damaged the pole. In the accident, Parveen, Manish and respondent No.1 sustained injuries on their person. After the accident, injured were taken to General Hospital, Sonepat where Parveen and Manish were declared dead and respondent No.1 was referred to PGIMS Rohtak. Said accident took place due to sole rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. Deceased Manish was aged about 20 years on the day of accident and was unmarried. Deceased Manish was a Truck Mechanic and also doing business of trucks on commission basis and used to earn Rs.30,000/- per month. All the claimants were fully dependent upon the income of deceased Manish, as he was sole bread-earner of his family. Claimants No.1 and 2 are parents of deceased Manish whereas claimants No.3 to 5 are younger minor brothers and sisters of deceased. Claimants spent an amount of Rs.one lac on the last rites of deceased. After the death of deceased, claimants have suffered from a great pain, mental torture and agony besides financial loss. Deceased Parveen was aged about 24 years on the day of accident and was married. Deceased Parveen was a Helper in SSIPL Retail Ltd. and was also running a dairy and business of cattle and used to earn Rs.22,000/- per month. All the claimants were fully dependent upon the income of deceased Parveen, as he was sole bread-earner of his family. Claimants No.1 is wife, claimant No.2 is minor daughter, claimants No.3 and 4 are parents of deceased Parveen whereas claimants No. 5 to 7 are younger brothers and sisters of deceased. Claimants spent an amount of Rs.one lac on the last rites of deceased. After the death of deceased, claimants have suffered from a great pain, mental torture and agony besides financial loss. 4. The accident was caused due to sole negligence of respondent No.1 driver of offending vehicle and respondent No.2 is registered owner of offending vehicle and the offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.3 at the time of accident and hence, all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to compensate the petitioners. 5.Respondent No.1 did not come present despite service, so, he was proceeded against exparte vide order dated 11.03.2015. 6.Respondent No.2 filed written statement taking preliminary objections regarding maintainability, cause of action, locus standi. On merits, respondent No.2 denied the allegations for want of knowledge and have further resisted the present claim petition on the grounds that no such accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 and a false FIR has been lodged against him. The amount spent on last rites of deceased has been shown on higher side. The amount claimed by the claimants is on very higher side, excessive, exorbitant and without any basis. exaggerated one. Claimants are not entitled to any compensation and prayed for the dismissal of the petitions. 7.The respondent No.3 insurance company in its separately filed written statement took preliminary objections regarding mis-joinder and non-joinder of parties, cause of action, locus standi, maintainability and pleaded that they took all defences provided under Sections 134C, 147, 149, 157 and 170 of Motor Vehicle Act. No such alleged accident ever took place with alleged offending vehicle and the same has been falsely involved by claimants in order to grab the compensation. On merits, again the factum of accident and death of Manish and Praveen denied and averred that the deceased Manish was not a truck mechanic nor doing business of sale-purchase of trucks. It is also denied that deceased Parveen was a Helper in SSIPL Retail Ltd. and was also running a dairy and business of cattle and used to earn Rs.22,000/- per month. In fact, both deceased had no income. Income of deceased have been shown much exaggerated and without any basis. A false FIR was got lodged against the respondent No.1 whereas Maruti Van bearing No.DL-3C-AG- 4412 was not involved in the alleged accident. The amount of compensation claimed is excessive and exorbitant. Respondent No.3 took some additional please that respondent No.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident and vehicle in question was being plied in contravention of terms and conditions of insurance police and therefore, answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. 8.Vide order dated 05.01.2016, both claim petitions were consolidated and it was ordered that further proceedings will be recorded in main claim petition titled as Mukesh & others Vs. Madan & others. 9.On the pleadings of parties, the following issues were settled for adjudication on 05.01.2016 - 1.Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of Maruti Van bearing registration No.DL-3C-AG-4412, by its driver- respondent No.1 on 06.12.2014 within the jurisdiction of police Station Sadar, Sonepat causing death of Manish and Parveen, as alleged ?

Ex.P3Copy of Adhar Card of claimant Anand Parkash. Ex.P4Photo copy of ration card of claimant Anand Parkash. Ex.P5Copy of salary certificate of deceased Parveen.

However, learned counsel for respondent No.2 has tendered into evidence following documents :- a)Ex.R1Copy of registration certificate. b)Ex.R2Copy of driving licence of respondent No.1 Madan. c)Ex.R3Photocopy of insurance policy. 12.I have heard the arguments on behalf of both sides and have gone through the case file, my issue-wise findings are as under - ISSUE No.1 13. Onus to prove this issue was upon the petitioners. Under this issue, petitioners were required to prove that on 6.12.2014 at about 10.15 P.M., accident took place due to negligence of respondent No.1 driver of offending vehicle bearing Registration No. No.DL-3CAG-4412, due to which, Manish and Parveen died. In order to prove this issue, petitioners Pooja and Jai Pal stepped into witness-box as PW1 and PW2 respectively and tendered their duly sworn affidavits Ex.PW1/A and Ex.PW2/A in their evidence and reiterated the averments of petition. Petitioner Jaipal PW2 is also alleged eye-witness of the occurrence. He deposed that on 6.12.2014, he alongwith his son Manish, Parveeen son of anand Parkash and Anand Parkash son of Roop Chander were going in a Barat from village Murthal in Maruti Van No.DL-3CAG-4412. Respondent No.1 was driving the vehicle at a high speed, rashly and negligently and without following traffic rules, due to which, offending vehicle struck against the divider and then pole, as a result of which deceased Manish and Parveen died. He has also deposed that on his statement, FIR No.475 dated 7.12.2014 under Sections 279/304A IPC was registered against respondent No.1. As against this cogent oral as well as documentary evidence regarding the manner of accident, no evidence whatsoever has been produced by the respondents. The respondent no.1 has not stepped into the witness-box to rebut the allegations and the evidence led by the petitioners. It is settled law that where driver of offending vehicle does not come forward to deny his negligence, there is a presumption that the claim of the claimant is correct. In this regard, reliance may be placed upon the law laid down in Raju & others Vs. Sukhvinder Singh and others, 2006(4) RCR(Civil) page 82 . Further, it is apparent that FIR Ex.P6 under Sections 279/304A IPC resulted into prosecution of respondent No.1 Madan and vide report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex.P12 and chargesheet Ex.P15, a prosecution was launched against respondent No.1. These facts are themselves sufficient corroboration to testimony of witnesses. In Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Shyam and others, reported in 1993(2) PLR 109, it is held by Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court that if FIR is registered against the driver, it is prima facie safe to conclude that the accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of the vehicle by its driver. Another plea of claimants is that in the above-mentioned accident, deceased Manish and Parveen had suffered injuries and such injuries proved fatal for them. To prove these facts, in addition to oral testimony of PWs, claimants have placed on record copies of Post Mortem Reports Ex.P1 and Ex.P7 of Parveen and Manish respectively which show that deceased had died on 6.12.2014 on account of injuries suffered by them on the same day. In view of my above discussions and reasonings and in the light of law discussed above, this Tribunal reached at the conclusion that said accident took place due to negligence of respondent No.1 being driver of offending vehicle, due to which, Manish and Parveen died. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners and against the respondents. I SSUE No.2 - 15.In claim petition titled as Mukesh & others Vs. Madan and others, claimants have claimed a compensation of Rs.60 lacs on account of death of Manish in the accident in question. It is the case of claimants that deceased Manish was truck mechanic and he also used to do sale-purchase of trucks on commission basis and in this way, he was earning Rs.30,000/- per month. Claimant Jaipal appeared in witness-box as PW2 and reiterated the above facts. However, the petitioners have not produced any documentary evidence to prove that deceased Manish was earning Rs.30,000/- per month. But, it has come in evidence that deceased Manish was a young and healthy person. In the given circumstances, the inference can be drawn that deceased Manish must be capable of earning equal to the income of unskilled labour and it can safely be assumed that deceased must have been earning minimum wage of unskilled labour which was about Rs.5500/- per month at the time of accident. Thus, annual income of deceased comes out to be Rs.66,000/- (Rs.5500/- x 12). 16.As far as the age of deceased Manish is concerned, it is claim of claimants that he was 20 years old at the time of his death. In PMR Ex.P7, age of deceased Manish has been mentioned as 19 years. In Secondary Examination Certificate Ex.P11, date of birth of deceased Manish has been mentioned as 01.12.1995. As per date of birth mentioned in Ex.P11, age of deceased Manish comes to 19 years on the date of accident. Hence, age of deceased is held to be 19 years at the time of his death. 17.Loss of dependency consists of three components for its determination viz. Future prospectus, income of deceased after deduction to be made and multiplier to be adopted. In Rajesh Vs. Rajbir etc., 2013, ACJ, 1403 , Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has laid down the formula for increase of income covering future prospectus. In the above mentioned case, it has been laid down that future prospectus shall be allowed 50% of actual income (after deduction of tax) for the persons below the age of 40 years, 30% for the age group of 40 to 50 years and 15% for the age group of 50 to 60 years and no addition thereafter. In the present case, the age of deceased has been held to be 19 years. Therefore, in view of law laid down in the case Rajesh Vs. Rajbir (supra) , 50% of actual income of deceased has to be increased towards future prospectus. After increased by 50%, annual income of deceased Manish comes out to be Rs.99,000/- (Rs.66,000/- + Rs.33,000/-). As far as deduction towards personal expenses of deceased is concerned, deceased Manish was unmarried at the time of accident and in the claim petition, the compensation has been claimed by his parents and minor sisters and brother who are stated to be only dependents of the deceased. Claimants No.1 and 2 being parents of deceased are first class legal heirs. Claimants No.3 to 5 being minor sisters and brother of deceased are second class legal heirs and being minors, they are fully dependent upon their parents i.e. claimants No.1 and 2 and hence, they are not entitled to any compensation. In view of these facts and relying upon the law laid down in case of Sarla Verma & Ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & others, 2009(3) RCR (Civil) page 77(SC) , ½ of the total income of deceased is to be deducted on account of personal and living expenses. After deducting ½ of the total income, annual dependency of claimants comes out to be Rs.49,500/-. Age of deceased has been held to be 19 years at the time of his death. In view of law laid down in Sarla Verma's case (supra) , the multiplier of '18' is applicable. By applying the multiplier of 18, total compensation comes to Rs.8,91,000/- (49,500/- x 18). Apart from that, claimants have also claimed compensation on account of loss of love and affection for claimants no.1 and 2 and an amount incurred on transportation and funeral and last rites of deceased. Claimants No.1 and 2 have lost their son. In view of Rajesh case (supra), Rs.50,000/- (Rs.fifty thousand only) is awarded to claimants No.1 and 2 for loss of love and affection and Rs.5,000/- (Rs. Five thousand only) towards expenses spent on transportation and Rs.10,000/- (Rs.ten thousand only) towards funeral expenses. Thus, total amount of compensation comes to Rs.9,56,000/- (Rs. nine lacs fiftysix thousand only). 18.In claim petition titled as Pooja & others Vs. Madan and others, claimants have claimed a compensation of Rs.60 lacs on account of death of Parveen in the accident in question. It is the case of claimants that deceased Parveen was working as helper in SSIPL Retails Ltd. and was also running a dairy and doing business of cattle. He was getting salary of Rs.5640/- per month. Deceased Parveen used to work on over-time and used to earn Rs.2500/- per month Regarding job and earnings of deceased, claimants have placed on file certificate Ex.P5. But Ex.P5 has not been proved by the claimants by examining concerned official from SSIPL Retails Ltd., so, Ex.P5 cannot be taken into consideration. Claimants have further claimed that deceased was also earning Rs.8000/- per month from dairy and Rs.6000/- from sale and purchase of cattle, but there is no proof about earnings of deceased on case file. But, it has come in evidence that deceased Parveen was a young and healthy person. In the given circumstances, the inference can be drawn that deceased Parveen must be capable of earning equal to the income of unskilled labour and it can safely be assumed that deceased must have been earning minimum wage of unskilled labour which was about Rs.5500/- per month at the time of accident. Thus, annual income of deceased comes out to be Rs.66,000/- (Rs.5500/- x 12). 16.As far as the age of deceased Parveen is concerned, it is claim of claimants that he was 24 years old at the time of his death. In PMR Ex.P1, age of deceased Parveen has been mentioned as 25 years. In copy of Adhar Card Ex.P16, only year of birth of deceased Parveen has been mentioned as 1988. As per year of birth mentioned in Ex.P16, age of deceased Parveen comes to about 26 years on the date of accident. Hence, taking into consideration Ex.P16, age of deceased is held to be 26 years at the time of his death. 17.As per formula for increase of income covering future prospectus Rajesh case (supra) , 50% of actual income of deceased has to be increased towards future prospectus as his age is held to be 26 years at the time of his death. After increase by 50%, annual income of deceased Parveen comes out to be Rs.99,000/- (Rs.66,000/- + Rs.33,000/-). As far as deduction towards personal expenses of deceased is concerned, deceased Parveen was married at the time of accident and in the claim petition, the compensation has been claimed by his widow, minor daughter, parents and two brothers and one sister and who are stated to be only dependents of the deceased. Claimants No.3 and 4 being parents of deceased are first class legal heirs. Claimants No. 5 to 7 being brothers and sister of deceased are second class legal heirs and being major, they are fully dependent upon themselves and hence, they are not entitled to any compensation. In view of these facts and relying upon the law laid down in case of Sarla Verma & Ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & others, 2009(3) RCR (Civil) page 77(SC) , 1/4th of the total income of deceased is to be deducted on account of personal and living expenses. After deducting 1/4th of the total income, annual dependency of claimants comes out to be Rs.74,250/-. Age of deceased has been held to be 26 years at the time of his death. In view of law laid down in Sarla Verma's case (supra) , the multiplier of '17' is applicable. By applying the multiplier of 18, total compensation comes to Rs.12,62,250/- (74,250/- x 17). Apart from that, claimants have also claimed compensation on account of loss of consortium for claimant No.1, loss of love and affection for claimants no.2 to 4 and an amount incurred on transportation and funeral and last rites of deceased. Claimant No.1 is widow of deceased Parveen. She lost her husband. She has lost valuable company of her husband at a young age and therefore, for the loss of consortium, she must be compensated adequately. In view of Rajesh case (supra), Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rs. One lac only) is awarded to claimant No.1 as a compensation for the loss of consortium being widow of deceased, Rs.1,00,000/- (Rs.one lac only) is awarded to claimant No.2 as a compensation for loss of love and affection and Rs.50,000/- (Rs.fifty thousand only) is awarded to claimants No.3 and 4 for loss of love and affection and Rs.5,000/- (Rs. Five thousand only) towards expenses spent on transportation and Rs.10,000/- (Rs.ten thousand only) towards funeral expenses. Thus, total amount of compensation comes to Rs.15,27,250/- (Rs. fifteen lacs twentyseven thousand two hundred fifty only). 18.The next question to be determined is as to by whom the compensation is to be paid? From the photocopy of insurance policy Ex.R3, it stands proved on record that the offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.3 i.e. insurance company w.e.f. 08.04.2014 to midnight on 07.04.2015, whereas the accident in question took place on 06.12.2014. Thus, the liability to make the payment shall be joint and several of all the respondents, but, ultimately liability of payment lies with respondent No.3 as offending vehicle was insured with it and respondent No.3 is bound to indemnify respondent No.2, the registered owner of offending vehicle. Accordingly, issue No.2 is decided in favour of petitioners. Issue No.3:- 14.Onus to prove this issue was upon the respondents. However, the respondents have not produced evidence to prove this issue. However, in view of findings given under issues No.1 and 2, it is held that the petitioners have a cause of action and locus standi to file the present petition and the present petition is maintainable. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of petitioners and against the respondents. Issues No.4 & 5 :- 15. Both the issues are taken together as the same are inter-connected. Onus to prove these issues was upon the respondents. Respondents have neither produced evidence to prove these issues nor pressed the same at the time of arguments. So, these issues are decided in favour of the petitioners and against the respondents. Relief - 24.In view of the findings of this Tribunal returned on the issues under adjudication, present petition succeeds and the same is accepted with costs. In claim petition titled as Mukesh & others Vs. Madan and others, the petitioners are awarded a compensation to the tune of Rs.9,56,000/ - (Rs.nine lacs fiftysix thousand only) with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of filing of petition till the date of realization.

Claim petition bearing No.MACP/324/2015 titled as “Smt.Suman Versus Dr.Prabhat Kumar and others” has been filed by petitioner Smt.Suman, who received injuries in a motor vehicle accident, which took place on 29.09.2014. 7 3. It is submitted that on 29.09.2014 petitioner Smt.Suman along with her mother-in-law Smt. Sheela, children Mudit and Harshita and her father-in-law Shri Suresh Jain were coming from Gurgaon in the car bearing registration No.HR-11-E-1121 being driven by respondent Sumit.

Further asserted that claimant has spent an amount of Rs.5,00,000/- on her treatment etc. That the petitioner was running her 8 cutting and tailoring business at Gohana and was earning Rs.10,000/- per month at the time of accident. 4. The petitioner has further stated that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No.1 and the petitioner has claimed compensation of Rs.25,00,000/- along with the interest from the respondents. 5. Claimant-injured Suresh Jain in the connected case bearing No.MACP/325/2015 pleaded that in the accident petitioner had sustained multiple injuries and was operated for various fractures etc. specially for the ankle bone and bursting of the head etc. and plates were inserted. That the claimant is still under treatment and had to visit time and again at Rohtak hospital for consultation and treatment. That the claimant had suffered permanent disability as the ankle bone had become stiffed and not working properly as ankle has become stiff and not completely cured .

The petitioner has claimed compensation of Rs.25,00,000/- from the respondents along with the interest. 6. Claimant-injured Mudit Jain in the connected case bearing No.MACP/326/2015 pleaded that in the accident he had sustained multiple injuries and was operated for various fractures etc. specially for the humerus bone and burst of the head etc. and plates were inserted. That 9 the claimant is still under treatment and had to visit time and again at Rohtak hospital for consultation and treatment. That the claimant had suffered permanent disability as the humerus had become stiffed and not working properly and shoulder of claimant has also become stiff and not completely cured. Further asserted that the claimant has incurred an amount of Rs.5 lakhs on his treatment etc. That the petitioner being student was maintaining his health as good and due to receiving injuries in the accident he has become disable to study and earn. That due to the accident, the claimant and his entire family had suffered a great shock and mental agony and the claimant has been debarred from enjoyment of life. The petitioner has claimed compensation of Rs.25,00,000/- from the respondents along with the interest. 7.Claimant-injured Sheela in the connected case bearing No.MACP/327/2015 pleaded that in the accident he had sustained multiple injuries and was operated for various fractures and K nailing was inserted for fractures of right elbow, knee, shoulder and burst of the head etc. and plates were inserted.

It is further the case of petitioners that at the time of accident, respondent No.1 was driving the offending vehicle, respondent No. 2 was owner and the offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.3 and in case the Hon'ble Court found the negligence on the part of the other vehicle also, therefore, all the respondents are liable to make payment of compensation amount to the petitioners jointly and severally. 9. Having received notice, respondent No.1 filed written- statement, thereby raising preliminary objections qua maintainability, cause of action, locus standi etc. On merits, it has been asserted that the income is wrong, false, excessive and imaginary one. Further asserted that the respondent No.1 has been falsely implicated in this case by the claimant in collusion with the local police just to extract compensation from the answering respondent as no accident took place on the part of respondent No.1. While denying the remaining averments, dismissal of petition with costs has been prayed for. 10.Learned counsel for the respondent No.2, vide his separately recorded statement of even date, has adopted the written-statement filed on behalf of respondent No.1. 11. Respondent No.3-insurance company has filed separate written statement thereby raising preliminary objections qua maintainability, cause of action, locus standi, mis-joinder of the necessary parties etc. Further asserted that no such accident ever took place with the offending vehicle and the offending vehicle has been falsely involved by the claimants in collusion and connivance of respondents No.1,2,4 and 5. 11 On merits, it has been asserted that the amount claimed is too much excessive, arbitrary and exorbitant and has no relevancy. In additional pleas, it has been asserted that the respondent No.1 was not having a valid and effective driving licence at the relevant time. Rest of the assertions are denied and prayed for dismissing all the claim petitions with costs. 12.Respondents No.4 and 5 (wrongly mentioned as respondents No.3 and 4) filed their joint written-statement thereby taking preliminary objections qua maintainability etc. On merits, it has been asserted that the accident had taken place by the rash and negligence driving on the part of respondent No.1. Rest of the assertions are denied and prayed for dismissing all the claim petitions with costs. 13.Respondents No.6 (wrongly mentioned as respondent No.5) filed his separate written-statement thereby taking preliminary objections qua maintainability, cause of action, locus standi, mis-joinder and non- joinder of necessary parties etc. Further it has been asserted that no such accident ever took place with the vehicle bearing registration No.HR-11E- 1121 and the same has been falsely involved by the claimant in collusion with the respondents No.3 and 4 with the help of police in order to grab compensation from the answering respondent. On merits, it has been asserted that the amount claimed is too much excessive, arbitrary and exorbitant and has no relevancy to the alleged loss sustained by the claimants. In additional pleas, it has been asserted that the respondent No.4 was not having a valid and effective driving licence at the relevant 12 time. Rest of the assertions are denied and prayed for dismissing all the claim petitions with costs. 14. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed on 916.05.2016:- 1.Whether the injuries to claimant Suman wife of Sumit, Suresh Jain son of Ram Kishan, Mudit Jain son of Sumit and Smt.Sheela wife of Suresh Jain are the result of accident which took place on 29.09.2014 due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle i.e. Swift Car bearing No.PB-13V-4784 by respondent No.1 and due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle i.e. car bearing No.HR-11E-1121 by respondent No.4? OPP. 2.If issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation, the claimants / petitioners are entitled to and from whom?OPP. 3.Whether respondents No. 1 and 4 were not holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident and the offending vehicles had violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect?OPR-3. 4.Relief. 15. In order to prove their case, claimants-injured, namely, Smt.Sheela, Suresh Jain and Smt.Suman examined themselves as PW-1 to PW-3, besides relying upon some documentary evidence. 16. On the other hand, respondents have not led any oral evidence but relied upon some documentary evidence. 17.I have appraised the evidence on record, the material circumstances of the case and the arguments addressed by learned counsel for the parties. My findings on the aforesaid issues are as under:- 13 ISSUE NO.1: 18. In support of this issue, claimant Smt.Sheela herself appeared into the witness box as PW-1 and reiterated her stand taken in the petition by tendering her duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW1/A. Further petitioners, namely, Suresh Jain and Smt.Suman have also tendered into evidence their duly sworn affidavits Ex.PW-2/A and Ex.PW-3/A respectively thereby deposing about the manner of accident and also corroborated the assertion of PW-1 as well as the facts mentioned in the claim petition. Further in support of this issue, petitioners have placed reliance upon documents i.e. copy of medical record/bills of claimants as Ex.P-1 to Ex.P-46, Ex.P-48 to Ex.P-55 and disability certificate as Ex.P-47. 19. On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents has argued that the accident in question did not cause with the offending vehicle and respondent No.1 as well as the offending vehicle has been falsely implicated in the present matter by the claimants in collusion with the police just to grab compensation. It is, therefore, prayed for deciding this issue in favour of respondents and against the petitioners. 20. The respondents have denied the factum of accident and involvement of the offending vehicle in any such accident outrightly. That being so the onus was heavily upon the claimants to establish on file that the accident had occurred on account of rash or negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No.1 and that in this accident claimants had received serious injuries. 14 21. To discharge the above onus, petitioners have appeared themselves before the court as PW-1 to PW-3 and reiterated the stand as taken in the claim petition. They categorically deposed that the accident was caused by respondent No.1 by driving the offending vehicle. The petitioners have not lodged any complaint to the police regarding the alleged accident. They have also failed to lead any evidence regarding the FIR/DDR of the accident in question. They have not placed copy of FIR/DDR regarding the alleged accident. Further the assertions of the petitioners have not been corroborated by any independent witness. Merely giving the bald statements by the petitioners themselves regarding the alleged accident with the offending vehicle, is not sufficient. Moreover, the medical records i.e. Ex.P-1 to Ex.P-55 placed on record by the petitioners, cannot be taken into consideration as the same are not proved in accordance with law. The petitioners have failed to examine the concerned doctor whether he had sent a ruqqa to the concerned police station regarding the road side accident. Even copy of ruqqa has also not been placed by the petitioners on record. Further the petitioners have also failed to prove their case by leading cogent, reliable and convincing evidence. Thus, the petitioners have failed to prove that they had sustained injuries in the accident with the rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle. 22. This Court has full sympathy for the injured-claimants for their pain and suffering but at the same time, it is the duty of this Court to protect the interest of the respondents. When the total facts and circumstances of the present case speaks itself that the case of injured- 15 claimants is false, fabricated and after thought and claimants have failed to prove that they had received injuries in an accident which was caused by respondent No.1 while driving the offending vehicle bearing registration No.PB-13V-4784. 23. In the result I hold that the claimants have miserably failed in establishing on file that the above accident had occurred on account of rash or negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No.1. Accordingly this issue is hereby decided against the claimants. ISSUE No.2. 24. Since issue No.1 has been decided against the claimants and it is established that the offending vehicle was not the vehicle which had caused the accident, this issue has become redundant and is decided as such. ISSUE NO.3 (Relief) : 25.

He witnessed the accident in question. He has further deposed that the accident in question was caused by respondent No. 1 by driving the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. He has also deposed that his brother Shambhu Shah sustained injuries in the accident and died at the spot. He has also stated that the offending vehicle had also struck an auto-rickshaw and the passengers of the auto-rickshaw had also sustained injuries. Petitioner Chander Bhushan has also deposed in his statement as PW 4 that the accident in question was caused by respondent No. 1 by driving the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and he had sustained injuries in the accident. 16.Charge-sheet Ex. P3 proves that the respondent No. 1 is being tried for the offences punishable under Sections 279/304-A of IPC for causing death of Shambhu Shah by driving the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner.

He has also deposed that their company provides labour, supervisors and other worker for industries and the deceased was working in Mat Breaks Limited through their enterprises. 19.The statement of PW 2 Sarita that the deceased was earning ₹ 15,000/- per month by running stall of Chinese food can not be believed because no documentary evidence regarding running stall has been produced. However, from the statement of PW 1 Jitender Singh, it is proved that the deceased was earning 8330/- per month. It may be presumed that ₹ some amount must have been deducted from his salary towards ESI etc. Keeping in view all facts and circumstances of the case, income of the deceased is presumed to be 8000/- per month. In school certificate Ex. ₹ P53, the date of birth of deceased Shambhu Shah is recorded as 18.12.1992. The accident in question took place on 06.06.2015. Therefore, it is proved that the age of the deceased on the date of accident was less than 23 years. In view of law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Rajesh vs. Rajbir 2013 ACJ 1403, 50% income of the deceased is to be added for IN THE COURT OF SUSHIL KUMAR, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT.

Therefore, income of the deceased is presumed to be ₹ 12,000/- per month which comes to 1,44,000/- per annum. There are five ₹ dependents of the deceased. After deducting 1/4th income of the deceased towards his personal expenses, annual loss of income comes to 1,08,000/- ₹ per annum. Since the age of the deceased was less than 25 years, the multiplier of 18 is applicable. By applying the multiplier of 18, total loss of dependency comes to 19,44,000/- (Rs. Nineteen Lakh Forty Four ₹ Thousands Only). 20.Besides, an amount of 1,00,000/- for loss of consortium, ₹ ₹ 1,00,000/- for loss of love and affection and loss of care and guidance to minor children and 25,000/- for funeral expenses are also allowed to the ₹ petitioners. 21.In view of my above discussion, it is concluded that petitioners (Sarita Devi & others) are entitled to compensation of 21,69,000/- only ₹ (Rs.

AWARD - The petitioner/claimant Sandeep has filed this claim petition under section 166 of MV Act against the respondents claiming compensation of Rs 15 lacs for the injuries suffered by him in the road side accident dated 24.2.2014. (Dr. D. N. Bhardwaj) MACT, Sonipat UID Code HR0100 Sandeep vs Neeraj M.A.C.P. No. 178 of 2015 -2- 2.The case of the claimant is that on 24.2.2014 at about 12.30 P.M petitioner Sandeep alongwith his relative Sombir was going on new motorcycle bearing registration no. applied for, being driven by Sombir petitioner on which Sandeep was pillion rider. When they reached near village Jharoth poultry farm wagon R car bearing registration no. HR 79- 1761 being driven by respondent no.1 Neeraj in rash and negligent manner came from opposite side and hit their motorcycle due to which they received injuries on head, hips mouth etc and were shifted to Cygnus JK Hindu Hospital and after few days he was referred to Sant Parmanand Hospital Delhi and then referred to Kathuria Brain and Spine Neuro Centre Rohtak. The petitioner is permanently disabled and is unable to work as an ordinary man and is still under treatment. The petitioner remained in hospital from 24.2.2014 to 4.3.2014 in Cygnus Hospital, Sonepat and from 4.3.2014 to 11.3.2014 in Sant Parma Nand Hospital and again admitted in Cygnus Hospital Sonepat from 11.3.2014 to 15.3.2014 and also under treatment of brain from 17.4.1014 to 24.6.2014 and is still under treatment.

He spent Rs 4,50,000/- on his treatment and has also incurred expenditure on medicines, special diet and attendant etc. The petitioner claims his income to be Rs 15000/- per month as he was working as driver. 3.On notice respondents no. 1 and 2 Neeraj driver and Sohan Lal owner of the offending vehicle have filed their joint written statement on the (Dr. D. N. Bhardwaj) MACT, Sonipat UID Code HR0100 Sandeep vs Neeraj M.A.C.P. No. 178 of 2015 -3- ground that no such accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 while driving the vehicle bearing registration no. HR 79-1761. The petitioner has wrongly involved respondents and vehicle in question. False FIR was registered in connivance with the police. The petition was not earning anything and the amount of compensation claimed is exaggerated. The offending vehicle is owned by respondent no.2 and duly insured with respondent no.3. Petitioner is not entitled to any compensation. Other allegations were also denied. 4. Respondent no.3 has filed separate written statement wherein it denied the factum of accident. The claimant be put to strict proof to prove the accident. However it is also pleaded that Car HR 79-1761 was running on road in violation of terms and condition of the insurance policy. No information about the accident was ever given. It is also pleaded that respondent no.1/driver of offending vehicle was not having a valid and effective driving license a the time of accident and the vehicle was being driven in violation of provisions of MV Act. Respondent no.1 and vehicle in question have been falsely involved in this case. The other allegations were denied. 5.On the basis of above mentioned pleadings of the parties, for adjudication, following issues were framed vide order dated 30.9.2016: 1.Whether the accident took place on 24.2.2014 at about 12.30.P.M within the jurisdiction of police station Kharkhoda, Sonepat due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle bearing registration No. HR-79- 1761 by its driver/respondent No.1 resulting into injuries to Sandeep, as alleged? OPP 2.Whether the petitioner is entitled to get the compensation? If so to what amount and from whom? (Dr. D. N. Bhardwaj) MACT, Sonipat UID Code HR0100 Sandeep vs Neeraj M.A.C.P. No. 178 of 2015 -4- OPP 3. Whether the respondent No.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence on the date and at the time of alleged accident , if so, its effect? OPR 4. Relief. 6.In support of his claim, the claimant himself appeared as PW1 and examined PW2 Nand Kishore record clerk Sant Parmanand Hosptal Delh, and tendered documents. 7.On the other hand, respondents have led no oral evidence. But documents have been tendered. 8.I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the record . My issue-wise findings are as under:- ISSUEs NO.1 &2 - 9. This is a claim petition filed by petitioner injured Sandeep with regard to injuries sustained by him in accident, caused by respondent no.1 while driving the offending vehicle no.79-1761 ( herein after called as offending vehicle) in a rash and negligent manner. To prove rash and negligent driving petitioner Sandeep appeared as PW1 in the witness-box and deposed that he was hit by offending vehicle driven by respondent no.1 Neeraj in a rash and negligent manner and due to the accident he alongwith Sombir sustained multiple injuries and he remained admitted in Cygnus Hospital Sonepat from 24.2.2014 to 4.3.2014, in Sant Parmanand hospital from 4.3.2014 to 11.3.2014 and remained under treatment of brain from 17.4.2014 to 24.4.2014 and blood was accumulated n the brain and veins have been blocked. He spent huge amount on his treatment, special diet etc and is still under treatment. (Dr. D. N. Bhardwaj) MACT, Sonipat UID Code HR0100 Sandeep vs Neeraj M.A.C.P. No. 178 of 2015 -5- 10. PW2 Nand Kishore record clerk Sant Parmanand Hospital Delhi proved the medical record of injured Sandeep. He deposed that Sandeep was admitted in their hosptial on 4.3.2014 and was discharged on 11.3.2014. He proved bill Ex P155 to P162 which were issued by their hospital and further bills Ex P196 to P209 issued by Goyal Pharmacy and Optical situated in their hospital. 11.The learned counsel for the respondent no.3 argued that there was delay of four days in registration of FIR. The contention of learned counsel for respondent no.3 is not tenable, as , the delay is well explained by the petitioner that the claimant was unfit to make statement up to 25.2.2014. Thereafter the police contacted the claimant on 28..2.2014. For the fault of police if any, the claimant cannot be made to suffer . The delay in lodging the FIR which is well explained cannot be a ground to doubt the claimant's case and deny justice to the victim. Lodging of FIR certainly proves the factum of accident and delay in doing so cannot be the main ground for rejecting the claim . 12.The petitioner has placed on record copy of FIR 240 recorded at police station Kh arkhoda under section 279, 337 and 338 IPC on 28.2.2014 in regard to his accident and in the FIR number of the offending vehicle and name of respondent no.1 driver of the car is specifically mentioned. The filing of FIR is an important piece of corroborative evidence in an enquiry before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal. The enquiry before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal is an enquiry of civil nature, wherein strict rules of law of evidence are not applicable. The lodging of FIR, in itself carries a good probative value for proving the above mentioned allegations. Reference in this (Dr. D. N. Bhardwaj) MACT, Sonipat UID Code HR0100 Sandeep vs Neeraj M.A.C.P. No. 178 of 2015 -6- regard can be made to New India Assurance Co.Vs Saloni Dargan and Ors1990 ACJ 127 wherein it was held that the procedure before the Tribunal is summary procedure and any document having some probative value and the genuineness of which is not in doubt, can be looked into by the tribunal. Further where a FIR is registered against the driver for causing accident by rash and negligent driving, it is prima facie safe to conclude that the accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of the vehicle by its driver. Reference can be made to Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Shyam and others 1993(2) PLR 109 . 13. As per medical record/ treatment placed on record, the claimant was treated at Cygnus JK Hindu Hospital and Sant Parmanand hospital etc for injuries in road side accident. As per discharge summary Ex P141 there was fracture Acetabulum right + Fracture mandible, Fracture right zylomatic Arch + Floor of right orbit and petitioner was operated upon and internal fixation with bone plating mandible + IRIF screw was fixed. The petitioner also sustained head injuries. As per medical record petitioner remained admitted in Cygnus Hindu Hospital from 24.2.2014 to 4.3.2015 and from 4.3.2014 to 11.3.2014 n Sant Parrmanend Hospital Delhi. So it is established that after accident the petitioner was treated at Cygnus hospital Sonepat and Sant Parmanand Hospital Delhi. 14. The petitioner has placed on record bills of Rs.3,27832/-. In the evidence as well as petition petitioner submitted that he was earning Rs 15,000/- per month from his work as he was driver. But he has not placed on record any document to prove his income. (Dr. D. N. Bhardwaj) MACT, Sonipat UID Code HR0100 Sandeep vs Neeraj M.A.C.P. No. 178 of 2015 -7- 15 The petitioner must have undergone the agony of physical as well as mental pain and sufferings on account of the injuries received in the accident. No hard and fast rule can perhaps be laid down for assessing the compensation for the pain and sufferings undergone by an injured. However, the nature of the injuries, parts of the body involved, the period of hospitalization, the period required for recovery from the injuries and age and socio-economic conditions of the injured can be the guiding factors. The petitioner must have spent some amount on the medicines /treatment etc. 16No evidence in rebuttal has been led by the respondents. However, keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case as well as the documents i.e. the medical record/ bills, prescription slips regarding consultation the following reasonable amount of compensation is assessed to be paid to the petitioner : 1. Medical bills Rs. 3,27,832/-. 2. Hospitalization including Rs. 50,000/- attendant expenses/Loss of income. 3. Pain and sufferings Rs.10,000/- 4. Transportation, diet e tc.Rs.5,000/- Rs.3,92,832/- From the aforementioned discussion the petitioner is held entitled to get Rs.3,92,832/- as compensation. Accordingly issue no.1 and 2 are decided in favour of the petitioner. 17 The question, who is liable to pay the amount would be dealt with (Dr. D. N. Bhardwaj) MACT, Sonipat UID Code HR0100 Sandeep vs Neeraj M.A.C.P. No. 178 of 2015 -8- issue no.3. ISSUE NO.3: 18. The respondents have not led any evidence to disprove the case of the claimant. Documents Ex. R1 to R3 have been tendered by the respondents. Ex R3 is driving license of respondent no.1/ driver of the offending vehicle and he isauthorized to drive motorcycle, LMV ,-NT and car. It is valid up to 13.1.2033. Ex R1 is RC of the car in the name of respondent no.2 Sohan Lal, owner of the offending vehicle. Ex R2 is insurance policy of the offending vehicle which is effective from 11.1.2014 to 10.1.2015. The accident took place on 24.2.2014. So at the time of accident respondent no.1 was having a valid driving license and respondent no.2 was having valid RC and vehicle was insured with respondent no.3. 19 In view of the fact noticed above, accident was caused by respondent no.1 by driving offending car in a rash and negligent manner and in view of the fact that the vehicle was insured by respondent no.2 with respondent no.3 all the responde nts are jointly and severally are liable to pay compensation to petitioner As the vehicle was insured with respondent no.3 the payment will be made by it. RELIEF 20.In view of the findings of this Tribunal returned on the issues under adjudication, present petition partly succeeds and the same is partly accepted with costs and claimant is held entitled to compensation of Rs.3,92,832/-.on account of injuries sustained by him in the accident in question. Respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the same. As the vehicle is insured with (Dr. D. N. Bhardwaj) MACT, Sonipat UID Code HR0100 Sandeep vs Neeraj M.A.C.P. No. 178 of 2015 -9- respondent no.3, Insurance company shall be liable to pay the amount of compensation from the date of filing of petition. 21 The claimant is also allowed interest on the amount of compensation so awarded at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the date of payment, if the amount is deposited within two months of passing of the award, failing which respondents shall be liable to pay interest @ 9% per annum on the amount of compensation till payment. 22.On realization of compensation amount along with interest, the entire amount of compensation along with interest shall be paid in cash alongwith interest.

Shri Joginder Kuhar, Advocate for respondent No.2. AWARD : This Award shall dispose of both claim petitions titled above, as both petitions have arisen out of the same accident and were consolidated vide order dated 17.07.2015 and the common issues were framed and further proceedings were carried out in main petition No.MACP/49/2015 titled as “Santosh Versus Gordhan and other .” 2.The claimant of main petition titled as Santosh Versus Gordhan and other, filed the claim petition on account of injuries by her in a motor vehicular accident claiming compensation to the tune of Rs.10.00 lacs. The claim petition titled as Meena & others Versus Gordhan and other has been filed by the petitioners for compensation to the tune of Rs.40 lacs on account of death of Narender in the accident in question. 3. While providing the particulars as required under the Motor Vehicles Act and the Rules framed thereunder, claimants interalia alleged that on 22.12.2014 at about 11.00 A.M., petitioner-injured alongwith her son Narender (since deceased) was going from their village Sirdhana to PGI Khanpur for treatment of her eyes on motorcycle bearing No.HR-60A/0758 driven by son of petitioner. Claimant and her son were also being followed by claimant's another son namely Surender on another motorcycle. At about 11.30 AM, when they reached near (Hukam Singh) MACT,Sonepat.4.3.2017. Santosh, Meenu & others Vs. Gordhan & other. 3 Pugthala Petrol Pump, suddenly a blue canter bearing registration No.HR- 69B/0997 came from front side being driven at a high speed, rashly and negligently and hit their motorcycle. After the accident, driver of canter ran away from the spot after leaving the offending vehicle bearing No.HR-69B/0997 at the spot. In this accident, petitioner and her son sustained injuries. Surender took the petitioner and her son to PGI Khanpur and fromwhere they were referred to PGI Rohtak but Surender admitted them in Aggarsain Hospital, Panipat for their treatment. During treatment, Narender succumbed to his injuries on 26.12.2014. Claimant spent more than Rs.6 lacs on her treatment. An FIR No.549 dated 22.12.2014 under Section 279/337/304A IPC was got lodged at P.S. Gannaur by Surender son of claimant against respondent No.1. Aforesaid accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1. Deceased was doing tuition work and was earning Rs.10,000/- per month. Deceased was earning Rs.15000/- per month from dairy and agriculture work. Deceased was 24 years old at the time of accident. Due to sudden and untimely death of deceased, the petitioners have suffered great mental shock, agony and have been deprived of love, affection and services and future income of deceased. The respondent No.1 being driver as well as owner of offending vehicle and respondent No.2 being insurer of offending vehicle are jointly and severally liable to make payment of compensation. 4.On notice, all the respondents put in appearance. Respondent No.1 in his written statement denied the allegations for want of knowledge. He further resisted the present claim petition on the grounds that no such accident had taken place and a false FIR lodged against him. All the facts stated about the occurrence of accident are incorrect. He is having a valid driving licence. The amount claimed (Hukam Singh) MACT,Sonepat.4.3.2017. Santosh, Meenu & others Vs. Gordhan & other. 4 by the claimants is exaggerated one. Claimants are not entitled to any compensation and prayed for the dismissal of the petition. 5.The respondent No.2 insurance company in its separately filed written statement took preliminary objections regarding mis-joinder and non-joinder of necessary parties, cause of action, maintainability and locus standi. No such alleged accident ever took place with alleged offending vehicle and the same has been falsely involved by the claimant in collusion with respondent No. 1 in order to grab compensation. Respondent No.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident. Answering respondent relied upon all pleas available to it under Sections 147, 149 and 170 of M.V . Act. On merits, respondent No.2 denied the factum of accident and pleaded that the claimant was not earning anything. A false FIR was lodged regarding alleged occurrence. No amount was spent on the treatment and transportation of claimant Santosh and deceased Narender. A false FIR has been got registered against respondent No.1 in order to extract compensation from it and claimed amount of compensation is excessive and exorbitant. Additional plea has also been taken by respondent No.2 to the effect that respondent No.1 was not having a valid and effective driving licence at the relevant time and has violated the terms and conditions of insurance policy. The vehicle in question was not having a valid registration certificate, route permit and fitness certificate at the relevant time. 6.On the pleadings of parties, the following issues were settled for adjudication on 17.07.2015 - 1.Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of canter bearing registration No.HR-69B/0997, by its driver-respondent (Hukam Singh) MACT,Sonepat.4.3.2017.

Santosh, as alleged? OPP. 2.If issue No.1 is proved in the affirmative, to what amount of compensation, the petitioners are entitled to and from whom? OPP. 3.Whether the claim petition is not maintainable and petitioners have no cause of action and locus standi to file the present claim petition?OPR. 4.Whether the respondent No.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at time of alleged accident. If so, its effect? OPR. 5.Whether respondent No.1 was driving the vehicle i.e. canter bearing registration No.HR-69B/0997 in violation of terms and conditions of insurance policy?OPR. 6.Relief. 7.In order to prove their case, petitioners Santosh and Meenu appeared in witness box as PW1 and PW2 respectively.

He tendered his duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW3/A in his evidence and reiterated and reasserted the averments of petition. PW4 Rahul is Medical Record Keeper of Maharaja Aggarsain Hospital, Panipat. He tendered medical bills Ex.P1 to Ex.P30 issued by his hospital. He also brought treatment record of deceased Narender and injured Santosh which are Ex.P31 and Ex.P32. PW5 Surender Kumar, Assistant of Pharmacist, Sanyog Pharmacy, Panipat has tendered bills Ex.P33 to Ex.P52, Ex.P70 and Ex.P79 issued by his Pharmacy. 12.In FIR Ex.P79 also, all particulars necessary to identify the offending vehicle and for proving cause of accident are mentioned. The number of offending vehicle is clearly mentioned in the First Information Report. FIR Ex.P79 under Sections 279/337/304A IPC resulted into prosecution of respondent No.1 Gordhan and vide report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex.P67 and chargesheet Ex.P69, a prosecution was launched against respondent No.1. These facts are themselves sufficient corroboration to testimony of witnesses. In Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Shyam and others, reported in 1993(2) PLR 109, it is held by Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court that if FIR is registered against the driver, it is prima facie safe to conclude that the accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of the vehicle by its driver. As against this cogent oral as well as documentary evidence regarding (Hukam Singh) MACT,Sonepat.4.3.2017. Santosh, Meenu & others Vs. Gordhan & other. 9 the manner of accident, no evidence whatsoever has been produced by the respondents. The respondent no.1 has not stepped into the witness-box to rebut the allegations and the evidence led by the petitioners. It is settled law that where driver of offending vehicle does not come forward to deny his negligence, there is a presumption that the claim of the claimant is correct. In this regard, reliance may be placed upon the law laid down in Raju & others Vs. Sukhvinder Singh and others, 2006(4) RCR(Civil) page 82 . Moreover, had respondent No.1 Gordhan been falsely implicated in the criminal case, then he would have filed complaint to higher authorities regarding his false involvement, but, no such complaint is shown to have been filed. Another plea of claimants is that in the above-mentioned accident, claimant Santosh suffered injury and deceased Narender had suffered injuries which proved fatal for him. To prove these facts, in addition to oral testimony of PWs, claimants have placed on record copy of MLR Ex.P80 and post mortem report Ex.P81 of Narender. They have also proved MLR of claimant Santosh, medical record and bills of medicines to prove the injuries sustained by claimant Santosh. In view of my above discussions and reasonings and in the light of law discussed above, this Tribunal reached at the conclusion that said accident took place due to negligence of respondent No.1 being driver of offending vehicle, due to which, Narender expired and petitioner Santosh sustained injuries. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners and against the respondents. I SSUE No.2 - 13.In claim petition titled as Santosh Vs. Gordhan and other, petitioner Santosh claimed compensation of Rs.10 lacs on account of injuries suffered by her (Hukam Singh) MACT,Sonepat.4.3.2017. Santosh, Meenu & others Vs. Gordhan & other. 10 in the motor vehicular accident in question. In case of compensation on account of injuries, the Tribunal has to see the nature of injuries, duration of treatment, expenses on treatment, pain, sufferings, mental agony, special diet and loss of income of insured. Petitioner Santosh when appeared in the witness-box as PW1 has deposed that she sustained serious, grievous and multiple injuries in the accident in question. She was taken to PGI Khanpur but due to her critical condition, she was referred to PGIMS Rohtak but her son admitted her in Maharaja Aggarsain Hospital, Panipat on 22.12.2014 where she remained admitted upto 03.01.2015 as Indoor Patient. She has further deposed that she sustained serious and grievous injuries on head and all over the body. She also received multiple fractures on her left leg and her treatment is still continue. She is paying Rs.2200/- per month for an attendant. She has already spent Rs.2000/- per visit for more than 50 visits. She used to do dairy and agriculture work and suffered a loss of income of Rs.10,000/- per month. Petitioner has also produced documentary evidence that is medical record and medical bills. Ex.P2 to Ex.P11, Ex.P13 to Ex.P15, Ex.P18 and Ex.P19 are Investigation Slips which are amounting to Rs.7720/-. Ex.P12 and Ex.P16 are Procedure Slips which are amounting to Rs.500/-. Ex.P17, Ex.P20 to Ex.P24 are Sub Visit Receipts which are amounting to Rs.700/-. Ex.P25 to Ex.P29 are Manual Receipts which are amounting to Rs.840/-. Ex.P30 is detailed final bill which is amounting to Rs.1,30,660/-. Ex.P31 is Discharge Summary. Ex.P33 to Ex.P38, Ex.P41, Ex.P43 to Ex.P50 and Ex.P70 are medical bills, out of them Ex.P38 is with Ex.P36 and Ex.P43 and Ex.P45 are carbon copies of Ex.P41 and Ex.P70 respectively, so, Ex.P41 and Ex.P45 are not taken into account. Total of these (Hukam Singh) MACT,Sonepat.4.3.2017. Santosh, Meenu & others Vs. Gordhan & other. 11 medical bills comes to Rs.11757/-. Ex.P39, Ex.P40 and Ex.P42 are receipts against which amount was deposited by claimant. Ex.P51 is Ledger account which is amounting to Rs.41,426/-. Ex.P53 to Ex.P58 are Blood Bank receipts total of which comes to Rs.12,700/-. Ex.P59 receipt is amounting to Rs.200/-. Ex.P60 to Ex.P65 are advance receipts. Out of aforesaid medical bills, bills Ex.P3 to Ex.P7, Ex.P10, Ex.P11, Ex.P61 to Ex.P65 have been merged in bill Ex.P30. Bills Ex.P40 and Ex.P42 have been merged in bill Ex.P51. So, bills Ex.P3 to Ex.P7, Ex.P10, Ex.P11, Ex.P40, Ex.P42 and Ex.P61 to Ex.P65 are not taken into consideration. Thus, total amount of all bills comes to Rs.2,03,671.71. 14.As per disability certificate Ex.P86, claimant suffered 15% temporary disability. Claimant is a house-hold wife and due to temporary disability, she will have to suffer pain etc. in discharging her house-hold work. However, this temporary disability will come to an end on account of treatment and passage of time. Under these circumstances, claimant is granted Rs.15,000/- towards 15% temporary disability. 15.Further, it has been proved on record that petitioner sustained multiple injuries and remained admitted in hospital for 12 days and keeping in view of this fact, it may be assumed that besides medicines, petitioner must have spent some amount on special diet, transportation and attendant. Hence, a sum of Rs.5000/- (Rs.five thousand only) for attendant charges, a sum of Rs.5000/- (Rs.five thousand only) for special diet, a sum of Rs.5000/- (Rs.five thousand only) for transportation charges and a sum of Rs.20,000/- (Rs.twenty thousand only) for pain and sufferings are allowed to the petitioner. In view of above discussions, it is concluded that petitioner is entitled to a total compensation of Rs.2,38,671.71 say Rs.2,38,672/- (Rs.two lacs thirtyeight (Hukam Singh) MACT,Sonepat.4.3.2017. Santosh, Meenu & others Vs. Gordhan & other. 12 thousand six hundred seventytwo only). 16.In claim petition titled as Meenu & others Vs. Gordhan and other, claimants have claimed a compensation of Rs.40 lacs on account of death of Narender in the accident in question. It is the case of claimants that deceased Narender was earning Rs.25,000/- per month by doing tuition work, dairy and agriculture work. Claimant Meenu appeared in witness-box as PW2 and reiterated the above facts. However, the petitioners have not produced any documentary evidence to prove that deceased Narender was earning Rs.25,000/- per month. But, it has come in evidence that deceased Narender was a young and healthy person. In the given circumstances, the inference can be drawn that deceased Narender must be capable of earning equal to the income of unskilled labour and it can safely be assumed that deceased must have been earning minimum wage of unskilled labour which was about Rs.5000/- per month at the time of accident. Thus, annual income of deceased comes out to be Rs.60,000/- (Rs.5000/- x 12). 17.As far as the age of deceased Narender is concerned, it is claim of claimants that he was 24 years old at the time of his death and was married. Ex.P76 is copy of Adhar Card of deceased Narender in which his year of birth has been mentioned as 1990 as such on 26.12.2014, he was about 24 years old. Also, in MLR Ex.P80 and post mortem report Ex.P81, age of deceased has been shown as 24 years. Hence, age of deceased is held to be 24 years at the time of his death. 18.Loss of dependency consists of three components for its determination viz. Future prospectus, income of deceased after deduction to be made and multiplier to be adopted. In Rajesh Vs. Rajbir etc., 2013, ACJ, 1403 , Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has laid down the formula for increase of income covering future prospectus. In the above mentioned case, it has been laid down that future (Hukam Singh) MACT,Sonepat.4.3.2017. Santosh, Meenu & others Vs. Gordhan & other. 13 prospectus shall be allowed 50% of actual income (after deduction of tax) for the persons below the age of 40 years, 30% for the age group of 40 to 50 years and 15% for the age group of 50 to 60 years and no addition thereafter. In the present case, the age of deceased has been held to be 24 years. Therefore, in view of law laid down in the case Rajesh Vs. Rajbir (supra) , 50% of actual income of deceased has to be increased towards future prospectus. After increased by 50%, annual income of deceased Narender comes out to be Rs.90,000/- (Rs.60,000/- + Rs.30,000/-). As far as deduction towards personal expenses of deceased is concerned, deceased Narender was married at the time of accident and the compensation has been claimed by his widow, mother and father who are stated to be only dependents of the deceased. In view of these facts and relying upon the law laid down in case of Sarla Verma & Ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & others, 2009(3) RCR (Civil) page 77(SC) , 1/3 of the total income of deceased is to be deducted on account of personal and living expenses. After deducting 1/3 of the total income, annual dependency of claimants comes out to be Rs.60,000/-. Age of deceased has been held to be 24 years at the time of his death. In view of law laid down in Sarla Verma's case (supra) , the multiplier of '18' is applicable. By applying the multiplier of 18, total compensation comes to Rs.10,80,000/- (60,000/- x 18). Apart from that, claimants have also claimed compensation on account of loss of consortium for claimant No.1, loss of love and affection for claimants no. 2 and 3. Meenu, claimant No.1 is widow of deceased Narender. She lost her husband. She has lost valuable company of her husband and therefore, for the loss of consortium, she must be compensated adequately. In view of Rajesh (supra)' (Hukam Singh) MACT,Sonepat.4.3.2017. Santosh, Meenu & others Vs. Gordhan & other. 14 case,, Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rs. One lac only) is awarded to claimant No.1 as a compensation for the loss of consortium being widow of deceased and Rs.50,000/- (Rs.fifty thousand only) is awarded to claimants No.2 and 3 for loss of love and affection and Rs.25,000/- (Rs. twentyfive thousand only) towards expenses spent on transportation and funeral expenses. Thus, total amount of compensation comes to Rs.12,55,000/- (Rs. twelve lacs fiftyfive thousand only). 19.Claimants have also claimed treatment charges incurred on treatment of deceased Narender. Deceased Narender remained admitted from 22.12.201 to 26.12.2014 in Altius Maharaja Aggarsain hospital. Claimants have produced Detailed Final Bill Ex.P1 and cash receipts Ex.P8, Ex.P9, Ex.P52 and Ex.P85. PW3 Rahul, Medical Record Keeper, Maharaja Aggarsain Hospital, Panipat appeared into witness-box as PW4 and proved aforesaid bills. Bills Ex.P8 and Ex.P79 have already been merged in bills Ex.P1 and Ex.P52, so, bills Ex.P8 and Ex.P79 are not taken into consideration. As claimants have spent Rs.1,18,700/- vide Ex.P1, Rs.300/- vide Ex.P9, Rs.57574/- vide Ex.P52 and Rs.750/- vide Ex.P85 on the treatment of deceased Narender, so, amount of Rs.1,77,323/- is also awarded to the claimants. Now, total amount of compensation comes to Rs.14,32,323/- (Rs.12,55,000/- + Rs.1,77,323/-) (Rs. Fourteen lacs thirtytwo thousand three hundred twentythree only). 20.The next question to be determined is as to by whom the compensation is to be paid? From the photocopy of insurance policy Ex.R4, it stands proved on record that the offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.2 i.e. insurance company w.e.f. 29.09.2014 to midnight on 28.09.2015, whereas the accident in question took place on 22.12.2014. 21. As per petitioners, respondent No.1 was driving offending vehicle at (Hukam Singh) MACT,Sonepat.4.3.2017. Santosh, Meenu & others Vs. Gordhan & other. 15 the time of accident in a rash and negligent manner. Respondent No.1 is also owner of offending vehicle. Photocopy of driving licence of respondent No.1 is Ex.P84 and the same has been issued by Transport Authority, Nagaland. Respondent No.2 Insurance Company has claimed that respondent No.1 driver of offending vehicle was not having a valid driving licence at the time of accident. In support of its contention, respondent No.2 insurance company has examined Nimisha Shahani, Assistant Manager Legal as RW1 who tendered her duly sworn affidavit Ex.RW1/A. In her affidavit Ex.RW1/A, she deposed that respondent No.1 was holding driving licence bearing No.8390/Mkg/Prof/10/ TV/T/2010 allegedly issued by RTO Mokokchung, Nagaland and respondent No.2 got this driving licence verified from concerned RTO and as per verification report Ex.R1 and verification letter Ex.R2, aforesaid driving licence is not found on the smart card Sarathi. Ex.R3 reveals that driving licence is issued on Smart Card through the national software “SARATHI” from 30th October, 2009 in the State. Issue of driving licence on booklet has been discontinued in the State after Smart Card has been introduced. Thus, any licence purported to have been issued by any authority in Nagaland on booklet after 30th October, 2009 is not genuine. Further, all driving licence holders having the booklet or any manual formats asked to report to the office where they have been issued for the purpose of digitizing their data and subsequent issue in Smart Card Format before Ist December, 2014 after which driving licence other than Smart Cart shall be treated cancelled. Perusal of driving licence Ex.P84 of respondent No.1 reveals that the same is not issued on Smart Card and is effective from 20.01.2010. Thus, respondent No.2 Insurance Company has adduced the evidence to challenge the validity of said driving licence Ex.P84 produced by claimants. Respondent No.1 was required to produce evidence to (Hukam Singh) MACT,Sonepat.4.3.2017. Santosh, Meenu & others Vs. Gordhan & other. 16 rebut the evidence produced by respondent No.2, but he failed to do so which leads to adverse inference against him. Therefore, it is held that respondent No.1, driver of offending vehicle, was not holding valid licence at the time of accident in question. Hence, respondent No.1 driver and owner of offending vehicle is liable to pay the compensation to the claimants. 22.However, in view of admitted fact that respondent No.2 at the time of accident was insurer of offending vehicle. Hence, it will be initial burden of respondent No.2 Insurance Company to pay the amount of compensation to claimants. The Hon'ble Apex Court has laid down in number of cases that even if licence of driver is fake, still insurer would remain liable to pay the compensation to the petitioners and the insurer is entitled to recover the said amount from driver and owner of offending vehicle. Accordingly, respondent No.2 Insurance Company is under statutory obligation to pay the compensation amount to the claimants and thereafter, it can recover the said amount from respondent No.1 driver as well as owner of offending vehicle as per law. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of claimants. Issue No.3 - 23.In view of findings on issues No.1 and 2, present claim petition is maintainable and petitioners have cause of action and locus standi to file the present petition. Accordingly, this issue is decided against the respondents and in favour of petitioners. Issue No.4 - 24.Onus to prove this issue was upon the respondents. In view of findings on issue No.2, driving licence Ex.P84 was found fake, so, this issue is decided against respondent No.1 and in favour of respondent No.2. (Hukam Singh) MACT,Sonepat.4.3.2017. Santosh, Meenu & others Vs. Gordhan & other. 17 Issue No.5 - 25.Onus to prove this issue was on the respondents. In view of findings on issue No.2, driving licence Ex.P84 was found fake, so, respondent No.1 was driving the offending vehicle in violation of terms and conditions of insurance police. Accordingly, this issue is decided against respondent No.1 and in favour of respondent No.2. Relief - 26.In view of the findings of this Tribunal returned on the issues under adjudication, both petitions succeed and the same are accepted with costs. In claim petition titled as Santosh Vs. Gordhan and others, the petitioner is awarded a compensation to the tune of Rs.2,38,672/- (Rs.two lacs thirtyeight thousand six hundred seventytwo only) with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of filing of petition till the date of realization.

Said accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of alleged vehicle by respondent No.1. On the statement of complainant Devender Kumar, FIR No.364 dated 16.8.2015 under Sections 279/336/337 IPC was registered at P.S. Kharkhoda. At the time of accident, the age of the deceased was 39 years. He was posted at M.C. Primary Boys School, Delhi as Primary Teacher and was drawing salary of Rs.46,298/- per month. After his death, the petitioners have suffered a great mental pain and agony. Petitioners No.1 to 4 have no source of income and were fully depend upon the income of deceased.

On merits, respondent No.1 resisted the present claim petition on the grounds that alleged accident took place due to the fault of deceased himself who abruptly came on the road and due to negligent act of deceased, the accident occurred. A false case has been registered against him. Vehicle of answering respondent is not offending vehicle and the same has been falsely involved in the present case in collusion with local police. Answering respondent was driving the alleged offending vehicle at a (Rajesh Sharma) MACT, Sonepat.23.5.2017 Jyoti etc. Vs. Suresh etc. 4 moderate speed by observing traffic rules.

At about 2.30 PM, when they reached near bulb factory, they met Pardeep son of (Rajesh Sharma) MACT, Sonepat.23.5.2017 Jyoti etc. Vs. Suresh etc. 7 Sukhbir of their village and they were talking to each other by the side of road. Suddenly, a Santro car bearing registration No.HR-13E/8723 being driven by respondent No.1 at a high speed and in a rash and negligent manner, came from the side of village Jatola and hit Raju and he and Pardeep had a narrow escape. In this accident, Raju sustained serious and grievous injuries on his person. After hitting Raju, respondent No.1 hit his car against the pillar of main gate of bulb factory and he also sustained injuries. On asking, respondent No.1 told his name as Suresh Kumar son of Dalip Singh resident of Madina, District Rohtak at present resident of Bahadurgarh, District Jhajjar. After the accident, Raju was shifted to Savitri Hospital, Saidpur where first aid was given to him and thereafter, Raju was taken to Sri Bala Ji Action Institute, Delhi where he remained admitted till 19.8.2015 but could not survive. Post mortem was conducted at Sanjay Gandhi memorial Hospital, Delhi on 19.8.2015. The said accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of alleged vehicle by respondent No.1. On his statement, FIR No.364 dated 16.8.2015 under Sections 279/336/337 IPC was registered at P.S. Kharkhoda. In FIR Ex.P1 also, all particulars necessary to identify the offending vehicle and for proving cause of accident are mentioned. The number of offending vehicle is clearly mentioned in the First Information Report. Further, it is apparent that FIR Ex.P1, under Sections 279/336/337 IPC resulted into prosecution of respondent No.1 Suresh Kumar and vide Ex.P16 copy of charge and Ex.P17 copy of challan, a (Rajesh Sharma) MACT, Sonepat.23.5.2017 Jyoti etc. Vs. Suresh etc. 8 prosecution was launched against him. Section 304A IPC was later on added in charge-sheet Ex.P16 Copy of PMR Ex.P21, copy of MLR Ex.P22, copy of death report Ex.P23, copy of death summar Ex.P29 and death certificate Ex.P30 are also produced on case file. These facts are themselves sufficient corroboration to the testimony of witnesses examined by petitioners. As against this cogent oral as well as documentary evidence regarding the manner of accident, no evidence whatsoever has been produced by the respondent No.1. The respondent no.1 has not stepped into the witness-box to rebut the allegations and the evidence led by the petitioners. It is settled law that where driver of offending vehicle does not come forward to deny his negligence, there is a presumption that the claim of the claimant is correct. In this regard, reliance may be placed upon the law laid down in Raju & others Vs. Sukhvinder Singh and others, 2006(4) RCR(Civil) page 82 . Moreover, had respondent No.1 Suresh Kumar been falsely implicated in the criminal case, then he would have filed complaint to higher authorities regarding his false involvement, but, no such complaint is shown to have been filed. In view of my above discussions and reasonings and in the light of law discussed above, this Tribunal reaches at the conclusion that accident in question took place due to negligent driving of vehicle No.HR- 13E/8723 by respondent No.1 being its driver, due to which, Raju sustained grievous injuries and later on expired on 19.8.2015. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners and against the respondents. (Rajesh Sharma) MACT, Sonepat.23.5.2017 Jyoti etc. Vs. Suresh etc. 9 I SSUE No.2 - 11.Onus to prove this issue was upon the claimants. Claimants have claimed a compensation of Rs.2,00,00,000/- on account of death of Raju in the accident in question. It is the case of claimants that deceased Raju was employed in M.C.Delhi as teacher on permanent basis and his net monthly income was Rs.42,466/-. In order to prove the income of deceased Raju, petitioners have examined PW4 Parshant Mathur, School Incharge, M.C. Primary Boys School, Mubarakpur, Delhi who deposed that he has brought the summoned record and as per record, Raju son of Mahabir resident of village Saidpur was employee of M.C.D. and was working on the post of teacher on permanent basis. He proved salary certificate as Ex.P24. However, from Ex.P24 salary certificate, it is proved on record that deceased Raju was drawing Rs.42,466/- per month. Thus, monthly income of deceased Raju is taken as Rs.42,466/- at the time of accident. 12.As far as the age of deceased Raju is concerned, Ex.P5 copy of PAN Card and Ex.P7 copy of matriculation certificate show date of birth of deceased Raju as 7.7.1976. Parshant Mathur, School Incharge, while appearing in witness-box as PW4 has deposed that as per record, date of birth of deceased Raju is 7.7.1976. Thus, at the time of his death, deceased Raju was aged about 39 years. 13.Loss of dependency consists of three components for its determination viz. future prospects, income of deceased after deduction to be made and multiplier to be adopted. In Rajesh Vs. Rajbir etc., 2013, ACJ, 1403, Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has laid down the formula for (Rajesh Sharma) MACT, Sonepat.23.5.2017 Jyoti etc. Vs. Suresh etc. 10 increase of income covering future prospects. In the above mentioned case, it has been laid down that future prospects shall be allowed 50% of actual income (after deduction of tax) for the persons below the age of 40 years, 30% for the age group of 40 to 50 years and 15% for the age group of 50 to 60 years and no addition thereafter. In the present case, the age of deceased has been held to be 39 years. Therefore, in view of law laid down in the case Rajesh Vs. Rajbir (supra), 50% of actual income of deceased has to be increased towards future prospects. After increase by 50%, annual income of deceased Raju comes out to be Rs.63,699/- (Rs.42,466/- + Rs.21,233/-). Thus, annual income of deceased comes out to be Rs.7,64,388/- (Rs.63,699/- x 12). Deduction of income tax on Rs.7,64,388/- comes out to be Rs.77,878/-. After deduction of income tax, annual income of deceased Raju comes to be Rs.6,86,510/-. As far as deduction towards personal expenses of deceased is concerned, deceased Raju was married at the time of accident and was having two sons i.e. petitioners No.2 and 3 and in the claim petition, the compensation has been claimed by his widow, two sons and parents who are stated to be only dependents of the deceased. In view of these facts and relying upon the law laid down in case of Sarla Verma & Ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & others, 2009(3) RCR (Civil) page 77(SC) , 1/4th of the total income of deceased is to be deducted on account of personal and living expenses. After deducting 1/4th of the total income, annual dependency of claimants comes out to be Rs.5,14,882/-. (Rajesh Sharma) MACT, Sonepat.23.5.2017 Jyoti etc. Vs. Suresh etc. 11 Age of deceased has been held to be 39 years at the time of his death. In view of law laid down in Sarla Verma's case (supra) , the multiplier of '15' is applicable. By applying the multiplier of 15, total compensation comes to Rs.77,23,230/- (5,14,882 x 15). Apart from that, claimants have also claimed compensation on account of loss of consortium for claimant No.1, loss of love and affection for claimants No. 2 to 5 and an amount incurred on funeral and last rites of deceased. 14. Claimant No.1 is widow of deceased Raju. She lost her husband. She has lost valuable company of her husband and therefore, for the loss of consortium, she must be compensated adequately. In view of Rajesh (supra)' case,, Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rs. One lac only) is awarded to claimant No.1 as a compensation for the loss of consortium being widow of deceased and Rs.50,000/- (Rs.fifty thousand only) is awarded to claimants No.2 to 5 for loss of love and affection and Rs.25,000/- (Rs. twentyfive thousand only) towards expenses spent for funeral expenses. Thus, total amount of compensation comes to Rs.78,98,230/-. Claimants have also claimed the amount incurred on the treatment of deceased Raju. In order to prove the expenses incurred on the treatment of deceased Raju, petitioners have examined Dr. Virender Kumar, Sri Balaji Action medical Institute, New Delhi as PW6 who deposed that he has brought the summoned record pertaining to treatment of Raju who was admitted in their hospital on 15.8.2015 and died on 19.8.2015 and also proved Ex.P31 final bill of Rs.1,33,784/- and Ex.P32 to Ex.P37 cash (Rajesh Sharma) MACT, Sonepat.23.5.2017 Jyoti etc. Vs. Suresh etc. 12 receipts of Rs.600/- each i.e. Rs.3600/-. Total amount incurred on the treatment of deceased Raju comes to Rs.1,37,384/-. This amount of Rs.1,37,384/- is also awarded to the petitioners incurred by them on the treatment of deceased Raju. Thus, total amount of compensation comes to Rs.80,35,614/- (78,98,230/- + Rs.1,37,384/-) (Rs.eighty lacs thirtyfive thousand six hundred fourteen only). 15.The next question to be determined is as to by whom, the compensation is to be paid? Learned counsel appearing for petitioners tendered in evidence insurance policy Ex.P20. Learned counsel for respondent No.1 has also tendered insurance policies Ex.R3 and Ex.R4. Insurance policy Ex.P20, Ex.R3 and Ex.R4 are issued by respondent No.2 for the period of one year from 03.04.2015 to midnight 02.04.2016. The accident in question took place on 15.8.2015. Thus, the liability to make the payment shall be joint and several of all the respondents, but, ultimately liability of payment lies with respondent No.2 as offending vehicle was insured with it and respondent No.2 is bound to indemnify respondent No.1, the registered owner of offending vehicle. Accordingly, issue No.2 is decided in favour of petitioners. Issue No.3:- 16.Onus to prove this issue was upon the respondents. Respondents have not produced evidence to prove this issue. In view of findings given under issues No.1 and 2, it is held that the petitioners have a cause of action and locus standi to file the present petition and the present petition is maintainable. Accordingly, this issue is decided against the (Rajesh Sharma) MACT, Sonepat.23.5.2017 Jyoti etc. Vs. Suresh etc. 13 respondents. Issues No.4:- 17.Onus to prove this issue was upon respondent No.2. Learned counsel for respondent No.1 produced copy of driving licence as Ex.R2 perusal of which shows that it was renewed on 14.12.2012 and is valid upto 14.12.2017. It is issued for driving M.C. with gear, LMV-NT-Car only. Respondent No.2 has not produced any evidence that Ex.R2 is not a valid driving licence. Accordingly, this issue is decided against the respondent No.2. Issues No.5:- 18.Onus to prove this issue was upon the respondent No.2. Respondent No.1 has not produced evidence to prove this issue. Vide Ex.P20 and Ex.R3 and Ex.R4 insurance policy, offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.2 on the day of accident and therefore, respondent No.2 is bound to indemnify respondent No.1, the registered owner of offending vehicle. Accordingly, issue No.5 is decided against respondent No.2. RELIEF :- 19.In view of the findings of this Tribunal returned on issues under adjudication, present claim petition succeeds and same is hereby accepted with costs.

I have heard learned counsel for parties and have gone through the material pleadings, evidence as well as the legal proposition applicable to the case. My issue-wise findings with reasons thereof, are as follows - ISSUE No.1 - 10.Sh O.P Saini, ld counsel for the petitioner argued that immediately after the accident PW2 Anil reached at the spot and got registered FIR. He further deposed that after the investigation it was found that respondent no.1 Sunil was driving the offending vehicle at the Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -8- time of accident and said vehicle was owned by respondent no.2 Shankar. He referred the evidence of PW2 Anil and evidence of PW1 Sushil Kumar Criminal Ahlmad and submitted that respondent no.1 is facing trial in the criminal case titled as State of Sunil etc., FIR No.8 dated 10.1.2015, under section 279 and 304A IPC, PS City Gohana District Sonepat. He referred Ex P1 certified copy of report under section 173 Cr.PC., certified copy of site plan Ex P2, certified copy of superdari order Ex P3,Certified copy of application for superdari Ex P4, and Ex P7 certified copy of charge sheet. 11.On the other hand, Sh Pardeep Kumar ld. counsel for respondent no.1 submitted that respondent no.1 has got no concern with the accident in question and respondent no.1 was not driver of the offending vehicle. Respondent no.1 was falsely got involved in this case. He referred the evidence of respondent no.1, who appeared as RW1. 12.The ld. counsel for respondent no.2 argued that no accident took place with the vehicle bearing registration no. HR 58A-9349. He Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -9- also submitted that respondent no.1 was not employed as driver on the said vehicle by respondent no.2 and he referred the evidence of RW2 Shankar. He further argued that petitioners are required to prove that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. But petitioners failed to prove this fact. He further submitted that PW2 Anil is admittedly not an eye-witness. He further argued that the persons present at the time of accident were not examined as witness and merely because respondent no.1 is facing trial, it cannot be held that the offending vehicle was being driven by respondent no.1 and said vehicle was being driven rashly and negligently. In support of his contention ld. counsel for respondent no.2 relied upon the authority titled as R ajender Jha vs Aarti Rohatgi and another (2008-3) PLR, 6 and he prayed for dismissal of the claim petition. 13.It is a claim petition under section 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act and as such petitioners are required to prove the fact that the offending vehicle was being driven rashly and negligently by respondent no.1 at the time of accident. It is settled legal proposition of law that proof of negligence is essential to maintain claim for compensation under section 166 of MV Act. Therefore, it is clear that petitioners were Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -10- required to prove the fact that the offending vehicle was being driven rashly and negligently at the time of accident. 14.In order to prove this issue petitioners examined PW2 Anil, who deposed that on 10.1.2015 at about 7.30A.M his father Haridass was coming from his house on his Rehra for purchasing vegetables in New Subzi Mandi, Gohana, Sonepat. A vehicle TATA driven by respondent no.1 came in a very high speed rashly and negligently and struck his vehicle against Rikshaw of the deceased Hari Dass and due to said accident Hari Dass fell down on the road and sustained fatal injuries. He deposed that someone called the claimants and the claimants reached at the spot and took deceased to PGIMS Khanpur where he was declared dead. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and FIR No.8 of 2015 under section 279,304A IPC was registered on his statements in police station Gohana. During cross- examination he admitted that he was not an eye-witness of the accident and he received telephonic message about the accident. He is not aware about the person who made call to him. He also deposed that he reached at the spot after 15/20 minutes on receiving the intimation regarding the accident. He further deposed during cross-examination that when he Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -11- reached at the spot some vegetable sellers were present there and they told them about the occurrence and the particulars of the vehicle and its driver and thereafter he informed the police. 15. Therefore, it is clear from the evidence of PW2 Anit that he was not present at the time of accident and he was told regarding the particulars of the vehicle and its driver by some vegetable seller who were present at the spot at the time of accident. As such PW2 Anil is not an eye-witness and in these circumstances petitioners were required to examine some eye-witness, who was admittedly present near the spot of accident, to prove the fact that respondent no.1 was driving the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. 16.The claimants have also examined PW1 Sushil, who proved the record of the criminal case, titled as State vs Sunil bearing FIR No.8 dated 10.1.2015. Ex P1 is certified copy of the report under section 173 Cr.PC.,and after going through the report under section 173 Cr.PC it is clear that complainant disclosed regarding the registration number of the vehicle. After going through the report under section 173 Cr.PC it is not Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -12- clear that how the investigating office came to the conclusion that respondent no.1 was driving the said vehicle rashly and negligently. 17.In the present case respondent no.1 appeared in the witness- box as RW1 and deposed that he was not present at the time of alleged accident in the said vehicle. He further deposed that he was taking a cup of tea in Subzi mandi. He further deposed that respondent no.2 in collusion with the petitioner and police falsely got involved him in the present case. He also deposed that he is poor and illiterate person and was falsely implicated in this case. During cross-examination he deposed that he was falsely involved in this case at the instance of owner of the vehicle. However he admitted that he is facing trial in criminal case in Gohana, regarding accident in question. He denied the suggestion that he was ever employed by respondent no.2. He admitted that he never moved any application to higher authority qua the criminal case registered against him. He admitted that at the time of accident he was present in Sabzi Mandi Gohana. He admitted that he handed over the driving license to the police. He denied the suggestion that he was driving the vehicle at the time of accident. Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -13- 18.Respondent no.2 Shankar appeared in the witness-box as RW2 and deposed that respondent no.1 was never employed by him on vehicle bearing registration no. HT 58A-9349. After unloading the vehicle his brother went inside the shop of vegetable merchant parking his vehicle. When his brother reached at the spot, accident had already occurred with some other vehicle. His vehicle was falsely seized by the local police in connivance with the petition and respondent no.1. He further deposed that there was no occasion to keep respondent no.1 in employment. He further deposed that respondent no.1 is not even known to him. During cross-examination he admitted that he is registered owner of the vehicle bearing registration no. HR58A-9349. He admitted that he has not moved any application to higher authorities regarding false registration of the case against his vehicle. He admitted that after one hour it came to his knowledge that police has impound his vehicle. He denied the suggestion that Sunil was driver on his vehicle. He further deposed that his brother used to drive the said vehicle. 19.In the present case respondent no.1 Sunil and respondent no.2 Shankar, appeared in the witness box as RW1 and RW2 and they Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -14- denied having any relation between them. On the other hand, petitioners examined PW2 Anil who is not an eye-witness. ExP2 is copy of site plan and after going through the site plan Ex P2 it is clear that the alleged accident has not occurred on any main road but infact accident took place inside the New Sabzi Mandi Gohana, between shed no.1 and shed no.2. Therefore, it is clear that vegetable vendors and other persons must be present at the spot of accident. In his evidence PW2 Anil deposed that vegetables vendors told him regarding the particulars of the vehicle and the driver. In the present case respondent no.1 appeared in the witness box as RW1 and deposed that he was not driving the vehicle and he has got no concern with the vehicle in question. Respondent no.2 appeared in the witness-box as RW2 and he clearly deposed that he never employed respondent no.1 as driver on his vehicle. In the FIR only the registration number of the vehicle in question has been mentioned. As RW1 Sunil and RW2 Shankar clearly deposed that the accident had not occurred with their vehicle and the vehicle no. HR 58A-9349 was not being driven by respondent no.1 and as such there is no ground to discard their evidence, particularly when PW2 is not an eye-witness of the alleged accident. FIR was registered against unknown person and only the Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -15- registrations number of the offending vehicle is mentioned in the FIR and in these circumstances, merely pendency of criminal case against respondent no.1 is not sufficient because investigating officer was not examined and PW2 Anil is not an eye witness and RW2 denied having employed respondent no.1 as driver on his vehicle. The authority titled as Rajendra Jha vs Aarti Rohatgi and another (20-08-3) PLR 6 can be referred, in which Hon'ble Delhi High Court held that claimants are required to prove the fact that offending vehicle was being driven rashly and negligently. It was further held by Hon'ble Delhi High Court that mere lodging of FIR and taking the vehicle on superdari would not enough to prove the negligence on the part of driver. In the present case it is clear from the evidence of RW1 Sunil and RW2 Shankar that respondent no.1 was not driving the offending vehicle at the time of accident, as he was not employed as driver by respondent no.2 on his vehicle. There is no evidence that vehicle was being driven rashly and negligently.

Suddenly a vehicle TATA XINON driven by respondent no.1 in a rash and negligent manner came and struck against the rickshaw of deceased Hari dass due to which Haridass fell down on the road and sustained grievous injuries on various parts of his body and someone called the claimants telephonically and the claimants reached at the spot and took deceased to PGI Khanpur, where he was declared dead.

Police asked from respondent no.1 about the driver and owner of the vehicle and he told to police about respondent no.2 and he came next day to police chowki.

I have heard learned counsel for parties and have gone through the material pleadings, evidence as well as the legal proposition applicable to the case. My issue-wise findings with reasons thereof, are as follows - ISSUE No.1 - 10.Sh O.P Saini, ld counsel for the petitioner argued that immediately after the accident PW2 Anil reached at the spot and got registered FIR. He further deposed that after the investigation it was found that respondent no.1 Sunil was driving the offending vehicle at the Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -8- time of accident and said vehicle was owned by respondent no.2 Shankar. He referred the evidence of PW2 Anil and evidence of PW1 Sushil Kumar Criminal Ahlmad and submitted that respondent no.1 is facing trial in the criminal case titled as State of Sunil etc., FIR No.8 dated 10.1.2015, under section 279 and 304A IPC, PS City Gohana District Sonepat. He referred Ex P1 certified copy of report under section 173 Cr.PC., certified copy of site plan Ex P2, certified copy of superdari order Ex P3,Certified copy of application for superdari Ex P4, and Ex P7 certified copy of charge sheet. 11.On the other hand, Sh Pardeep Kumar ld. counsel for respondent no.1 submitted that respondent no.1 has got no concern with the accident in question and respondent no.1 was not driver of the offending vehicle. Respondent no.1 was falsely got involved in this case. He referred the evidence of respondent no.1, who appeared as RW1. 12.The ld. counsel for respondent no.2 argued that no accident took place with the vehicle bearing registration no. HR 58A-9349. He Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -9- also submitted that respondent no.1 was not employed as driver on the said vehicle by respondent no.2 and he referred the evidence of RW2 Shankar. He further argued that petitioners are required to prove that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. But petitioners failed to prove this fact. He further submitted that PW2 Anil is admittedly not an eye-witness. He further argued that the persons present at the time of accident were not examined as witness and merely because respondent no.1 is facing trial, it cannot be held that the offending vehicle was being driven by respondent no.1 and said vehicle was being driven rashly and negligently. In support of his contention ld. counsel for respondent no.2 relied upon the authority titled as R ajender Jha vs Aarti Rohatgi and another (2008-3) PLR, 6 and he prayed for dismissal of the claim petition. 13.It is a claim petition under section 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act and as such petitioners are required to prove the fact that the offending vehicle was being driven rashly and negligently by respondent no.1 at the time of accident. It is settled legal proposition of law that proof of negligence is essential to maintain claim for compensation under section 166 of MV Act. Therefore, it is clear that petitioners were Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -10- required to prove the fact that the offending vehicle was being driven rashly and negligently at the time of accident. 14.In order to prove this issue petitioners examined PW2 Anil, who deposed that on 10.1.2015 at about 7.30A.M his father Haridass was coming from his house on his Rehra for purchasing vegetables in New Subzi Mandi, Gohana, Sonepat. A vehicle TATA driven by respondent no.1 came in a very high speed rashly and negligently and struck his vehicle against Rikshaw of the deceased Hari Dass and due to said accident Hari Dass fell down on the road and sustained fatal injuries. He deposed that someone called the claimants and the claimants reached at the spot and took deceased to PGIMS Khanpur where he was declared dead. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and FIR No.8 of 2015 under section 279,304A IPC was registered on his statements in police station Gohana. During cross- examination he admitted that he was not an eye-witness of the accident and he received telephonic message about the accident. He is not aware about the person who made call to him. He also deposed that he reached at the spot after 15/20 minutes on receiving the intimation regarding the accident. He further deposed during cross-examination that when he Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -11- reached at the spot some vegetable sellers were present there and they told them about the occurrence and the particulars of the vehicle and its driver and thereafter he informed the police. 15. Therefore, it is clear from the evidence of PW2 Anit that he was not present at the time of accident and he was told regarding the particulars of the vehicle and its driver by some vegetable seller who were present at the spot at the time of accident. As such PW2 Anil is not an eye-witness and in these circumstances petitioners were required to examine some eye-witness, who was admittedly present near the spot of accident, to prove the fact that respondent no.1 was driving the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. 16.The claimants have also examined PW1 Sushil, who proved the record of the criminal case, titled as State vs Sunil bearing FIR No.8 dated 10.1.2015. Ex P1 is certified copy of the report under section 173 Cr.PC.,and after going through the report under section 173 Cr.PC it is clear that complainant disclosed regarding the registration number of the vehicle. After going through the report under section 173 Cr.PC it is not Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -12- clear that how the investigating office came to the conclusion that respondent no.1 was driving the said vehicle rashly and negligently. 17.In the present case respondent no.1 appeared in the witness- box as RW1 and deposed that he was not present at the time of alleged accident in the said vehicle. He further deposed that he was taking a cup of tea in Subzi mandi. He further deposed that respondent no.2 in collusion with the petitioner and police falsely got involved him in the present case. He also deposed that he is poor and illiterate person and was falsely implicated in this case. During cross-examination he deposed that he was falsely involved in this case at the instance of owner of the vehicle. However he admitted that he is facing trial in criminal case in Gohana, regarding accident in question. He denied the suggestion that he was ever employed by respondent no.2. He admitted that he never moved any application to higher authority qua the criminal case registered against him. He admitted that at the time of accident he was present in Sabzi Mandi Gohana. He admitted that he handed over the driving license to the police. He denied the suggestion that he was driving the vehicle at the time of accident. Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -13- 18.Respondent no.2 Shankar appeared in the witness-box as RW2 and deposed that respondent no.1 was never employed by him on vehicle bearing registration no. HT 58A-9349. After unloading the vehicle his brother went inside the shop of vegetable merchant parking his vehicle. When his brother reached at the spot, accident had already occurred with some other vehicle. His vehicle was falsely seized by the local police in connivance with the petition and respondent no.1. He further deposed that there was no occasion to keep respondent no.1 in employment. He further deposed that respondent no.1 is not even known to him. During cross-examination he admitted that he is registered owner of the vehicle bearing registration no. HR58A-9349. He admitted that he has not moved any application to higher authorities regarding false registration of the case against his vehicle. He admitted that after one hour it came to his knowledge that police has impound his vehicle. He denied the suggestion that Sunil was driver on his vehicle. He further deposed that his brother used to drive the said vehicle. 19.In the present case respondent no.1 Sunil and respondent no.2 Shankar, appeared in the witness box as RW1 and RW2 and they Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -14- denied having any relation between them. On the other hand, petitioners examined PW2 Anil who is not an eye-witness. ExP2 is copy of site plan and after going through the site plan Ex P2 it is clear that the alleged accident has not occurred on any main road but infact accident took place inside the New Sabzi Mandi Gohana, between shed no.1 and shed no.2. Therefore, it is clear that vegetable vendors and other persons must be present at the spot of accident. In his evidence PW2 Anil deposed that vegetables vendors told him regarding the particulars of the vehicle and the driver. In the present case respondent no.1 appeared in the witness box as RW1 and deposed that he was not driving the vehicle and he has got no concern with the vehicle in question. Respondent no.2 appeared in the witness-box as RW2 and he clearly deposed that he never employed respondent no.1 as driver on his vehicle. In the FIR only the registration number of the vehicle in question has been mentioned. As RW1 Sunil and RW2 Shankar clearly deposed that the accident had not occurred with their vehicle and the vehicle no. HR 58A-9349 was not being driven by respondent no.1 and as such there is no ground to discard their evidence, particularly when PW2 is not an eye-witness of the alleged accident. FIR was registered against unknown person and only the Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -15- registrations number of the offending vehicle is mentioned in the FIR and in these circumstances, merely pendency of criminal case against respondent no.1 is not sufficient because investigating officer was not examined and PW2 Anil is not an eye witness and RW2 denied having employed respondent no.1 as driver on his vehicle. The authority titled as Rajendra Jha vs Aarti Rohatgi and another (20-08-3) PLR 6 can be referred, in which Hon'ble Delhi High Court held that claimants are required to prove the fact that offending vehicle was being driven rashly and negligently. It was further held by Hon'ble Delhi High Court that mere lodging of FIR and taking the vehicle on superdari would not enough to prove the negligence on the part of driver. In the present case it is clear from the evidence of RW1 Sunil and RW2 Shankar that respondent no.1 was not driving the offending vehicle at the time of accident, as he was not employed as driver by respondent no.2 on his vehicle. There is no evidence that vehicle was being driven rashly and negligently. The accident took place inside the new Sabzi Mandi, Gohana and the persons who were present at the spot were not examined by the claimants. PW2 Anil is not an eye-witness. In the FIR only registration number of the offending vehicle has been mentioned and the FIR was Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -16- registered by PW2 Anil, who is not an eye-witness. The investigating officer was also not examined by the claimants and as per the report under section 173 Cr.PC, which is Ex P1 it is not clear that how the respondent no.1 was found by the police involved in this accident. 20. In view of above discussion, it is clear that petitioners failed to prove the fact that respondent no.1 was driving the offending vehicle at the time of accident and respondent no.1 was driving the vehicle rashly and negligently at the time of accident . As such issue no.1 is decided against the petitioners. ISSUE No.2 : 21 In view of my finding on issue no.1, it is clear that petitioner failed to prove the fact that deceased died due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle blearing registration no. HR 58A-9349 by respondent no.1 and as such petitioners are not entitled to claim any amount of compensation . Accordingly issue no. 2 is also decided against the petitioner. Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -17- ISSUE No.3 and 4: 22 . In view of my finding on issues no. 1 and 2, when issues no.1 and 2 are decided against the petitioners there is no need to decide these issues on merit. Hence these issues are decided accordingly. RELIEF: 23.In view of the findings of this Tribunal returned on the issues under adjudication, present petition fails and is hereby dismisised with costs. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly.

Suddenly a vehicle TATA XINON driven by respondent no.1 in a rash and negligent manner came and struck against the rickshaw of deceased Hari dass due to which Haridass fell down on the road and sustained grievous injuries on various parts of his body and someone called the claimants telephonically and the claimants reached at the spot and took deceased to PGI Khanpur, where he was declared dead.

However he was taking a cup of tea in sabji mandi. Respondent no.1 came at the spot after the accident. The accident was caused due to negligent driving of respondent no.2. It has been pleaded that the petitioner has filed a false and fictitious petition Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -4- only to extract money from the answering respondent. It has been pleaded that respondent no.1 went to said vehicle for cleaning and some persons kept him there and handed over to the police. Police asked from respondent no.1 about the driver and owner of the vehicle and he told to police about respondent no.2 and he came next day to police chowki. Respondent no.2 in collusion with petitioners and police falsely implicated respondent no.1 in criminal case. The complainant got registered the alleged FIR in collusion with police. It has been pleaded that accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.2. Rest of the contents of the petitioner was denied and prayer for dismissal of the petitioner was made. 3. Respondent no. 2 filed separate written statement.

I have heard learned counsel for parties and have gone through the material pleadings, evidence as well as the legal proposition applicable to the case. My issue-wise findings with reasons thereof, are as follows - ISSUE No.1 - 10.Sh O.P Saini, ld counsel for the petitioner argued that immediately after the accident PW2 Anil reached at the spot and got registered FIR. He further deposed that after the investigation it was found that respondent no.1 Sunil was driving the offending vehicle at the Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -8- time of accident and said vehicle was owned by respondent no.2 Shankar. He referred the evidence of PW2 Anil and evidence of PW1 Sushil Kumar Criminal Ahlmad and submitted that respondent no.1 is facing trial in the criminal case titled as State of Sunil etc., FIR No.8 dated 10.1.2015, under section 279 and 304A IPC, PS City Gohana District Sonepat. He referred Ex P1 certified copy of report under section 173 Cr.PC., certified copy of site plan Ex P2, certified copy of superdari order Ex P3,Certified copy of application for superdari Ex P4, and Ex P7 certified copy of charge sheet. 11.On the other hand, Sh Pardeep Kumar ld. counsel for respondent no.1 submitted that respondent no.1 has got no concern with the accident in question and respondent no.1 was not driver of the offending vehicle. Respondent no.1 was falsely got involved in this case. He referred the evidence of respondent no.1, who appeared as RW1. 12.The ld. counsel for respondent no.2 argued that no accident took place with the vehicle bearing registration no. HR 58A-9349. He Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -9- also submitted that respondent no.1 was not employed as driver on the said vehicle by respondent no.2 and he referred the evidence of RW2 Shankar. He further argued that petitioners are required to prove that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. But petitioners failed to prove this fact. He further submitted that PW2 Anil is admittedly not an eye-witness. He further argued that the persons present at the time of accident were not examined as witness and merely because respondent no.1 is facing trial, it cannot be held that the offending vehicle was being driven by respondent no.1 and said vehicle was being driven rashly and negligently. In support of his contention ld. counsel for respondent no.2 relied upon the authority titled as R ajender Jha vs Aarti Rohatgi and another (2008-3) PLR, 6 and he prayed for dismissal of the claim petition. 13.It is a claim petition under section 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act and as such petitioners are required to prove the fact that the offending vehicle was being driven rashly and negligently by respondent no.1 at the time of accident. It is settled legal proposition of law that proof of negligence is essential to maintain claim for compensation under section 166 of MV Act. Therefore, it is clear that petitioners were Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -10- required to prove the fact that the offending vehicle was being driven rashly and negligently at the time of accident. 14.In order to prove this issue petitioners examined PW2 Anil, who deposed that on 10.1.2015 at about 7.30A.M his father Haridass was coming from his house on his Rehra for purchasing vegetables in New Subzi Mandi, Gohana, Sonepat. A vehicle TATA driven by respondent no.1 came in a very high speed rashly and negligently and struck his vehicle against Rikshaw of the deceased Hari Dass and due to said accident Hari Dass fell down on the road and sustained fatal injuries. He deposed that someone called the claimants and the claimants reached at the spot and took deceased to PGIMS Khanpur where he was declared dead. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and FIR No.8 of 2015 under section 279,304A IPC was registered on his statements in police station Gohana. During cross- examination he admitted that he was not an eye-witness of the accident and he received telephonic message about the accident. He is not aware about the person who made call to him. He also deposed that he reached at the spot after 15/20 minutes on receiving the intimation regarding the accident. He further deposed during cross-examination that when he Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -11- reached at the spot some vegetable sellers were present there and they told them about the occurrence and the particulars of the vehicle and its driver and thereafter he informed the police. 15. Therefore, it is clear from the evidence of PW2 Anit that he was not present at the time of accident and he was told regarding the particulars of the vehicle and its driver by some vegetable seller who were present at the spot at the time of accident. As such PW2 Anil is not an eye-witness and in these circumstances petitioners were required to examine some eye-witness, who was admittedly present near the spot of accident, to prove the fact that respondent no.1 was driving the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. 16.The claimants have also examined PW1 Sushil, who proved the record of the criminal case, titled as State vs Sunil bearing FIR No.8 dated 10.1.2015. Ex P1 is certified copy of the report under section 173 Cr.PC.,and after going through the report under section 173 Cr.PC it is clear that complainant disclosed regarding the registration number of the vehicle. After going through the report under section 173 Cr.PC it is not Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -12- clear that how the investigating office came to the conclusion that respondent no.1 was driving the said vehicle rashly and negligently. 17.In the present case respondent no.1 appeared in the witness- box as RW1 and deposed that he was not present at the time of alleged accident in the said vehicle. He further deposed that he was taking a cup of tea in Subzi mandi. He further deposed that respondent no.2 in collusion with the petitioner and police falsely got involved him in the present case. He also deposed that he is poor and illiterate person and was falsely implicated in this case. During cross-examination he deposed that he was falsely involved in this case at the instance of owner of the vehicle. However he admitted that he is facing trial in criminal case in Gohana, regarding accident in question. He denied the suggestion that he was ever employed by respondent no.2. He admitted that he never moved any application to higher authority qua the criminal case registered against him. He admitted that at the time of accident he was present in Sabzi Mandi Gohana. He admitted that he handed over the driving license to the police. He denied the suggestion that he was driving the vehicle at the time of accident. Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -13- 18.Respondent no.2 Shankar appeared in the witness-box as RW2 and deposed that respondent no.1 was never employed by him on vehicle bearing registration no. HT 58A-9349. After unloading the vehicle his brother went inside the shop of vegetable merchant parking his vehicle. When his brother reached at the spot, accident had already occurred with some other vehicle. His vehicle was falsely seized by the local police in connivance with the petition and respondent no.1. He further deposed that there was no occasion to keep respondent no.1 in employment. He further deposed that respondent no.1 is not even known to him. During cross-examination he admitted that he is registered owner of the vehicle bearing registration no. HR58A-9349. He admitted that he has not moved any application to higher authorities regarding false registration of the case against his vehicle. He admitted that after one hour it came to his knowledge that police has impound his vehicle. He denied the suggestion that Sunil was driver on his vehicle. He further deposed that his brother used to drive the said vehicle. 19.In the present case respondent no.1 Sunil and respondent no.2 Shankar, appeared in the witness box as RW1 and RW2 and they Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -14- denied having any relation between them. On the other hand, petitioners examined PW2 Anil who is not an eye-witness. ExP2 is copy of site plan and after going through the site plan Ex P2 it is clear that the alleged accident has not occurred on any main road but infact accident took place inside the New Sabzi Mandi Gohana, between shed no.1 and shed no.2. Therefore, it is clear that vegetable vendors and other persons must be present at the spot of accident. In his evidence PW2 Anil deposed that vegetables vendors told him regarding the particulars of the vehicle and the driver. In the present case respondent no.1 appeared in the witness box as RW1 and deposed that he was not driving the vehicle and he has got no concern with the vehicle in question. Respondent no.2 appeared in the witness-box as RW2 and he clearly deposed that he never employed respondent no.1 as driver on his vehicle. In the FIR only the registration number of the vehicle in question has been mentioned. As RW1 Sunil and RW2 Shankar clearly deposed that the accident had not occurred with their vehicle and the vehicle no. HR 58A-9349 was not being driven by respondent no.1 and as such there is no ground to discard their evidence, particularly when PW2 is not an eye-witness of the alleged accident. FIR was registered against unknown person and only the Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -15- registrations number of the offending vehicle is mentioned in the FIR and in these circumstances, merely pendency of criminal case against respondent no.1 is not sufficient because investigating officer was not examined and PW2 Anil is not an eye witness and RW2 denied having employed respondent no.1 as driver on his vehicle. The authority titled as Rajendra Jha vs Aarti Rohatgi and another (20-08-3) PLR 6 can be referred, in which Hon'ble Delhi High Court held that claimants are required to prove the fact that offending vehicle was being driven rashly and negligently. It was further held by Hon'ble Delhi High Court that mere lodging of FIR and taking the vehicle on superdari would not enough to prove the negligence on the part of driver. In the present case it is clear from the evidence of RW1 Sunil and RW2 Shankar that respondent no.1 was not driving the offending vehicle at the time of accident, as he was not employed as driver by respondent no.2 on his vehicle. There is no evidence that vehicle was being driven rashly and negligently. The accident took place inside the new Sabzi Mandi, Gohana and the persons who were present at the spot were not examined by the claimants. PW2 Anil is not an eye-witness. In the FIR only registration number of the offending vehicle has been mentioned and the FIR was Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -16- registered by PW2 Anil, who is not an eye-witness. The investigating officer was also not examined by the claimants and as per the report under section 173 Cr.PC, which is Ex P1 it is not clear that how the respondent no.1 was found by the police involved in this accident. 20. In view of above discussion, it is clear that petitioners failed to prove the fact that respondent no.1 was driving the offending vehicle at the time of accident and respondent no.1 was driving the vehicle rashly and negligently at the time of accident . As such issue no.1 is decided against the petitioners. ISSUE No.2 : 21 In view of my finding on issue no.1, it is clear that petitioner failed to prove the fact that deceased died due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle blearing registration no. HR 58A-9349 by respondent no.1 and as such petitioners are not entitled to claim any amount of compensation . Accordingly issue no. 2 is also decided against the petitioner. Darshan etc vs Sunil etc -17- ISSUE No.3 and 4: 22 . In view of my finding on issues no. 1 and 2, when issues no.1 and 2 are decided against the petitioners there is no need to decide these issues on merit. Hence these issues are decided accordingly. RELIEF: 23.In view of the findings of this Tribunal returned on the issues under adjudication, present petition fails and is hereby dismisised with costs. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly. File be consigned to the records.

Thereafter, respondents closed their evidence vide separate statement. 17.No evidence in rebuttal evidence was led by the petitioners. 18.I have gone through the case file very carefully and minutely and heard the arguments put-forth by both the sides. My issue-wise findings are as under - ISSUE No. 1 : 19. Onus to prove this issue was upon the petitioners. Initiating arguments, learned counsel for the claimants/petitioners vehemently IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 21 contended that petitioners Anita, Rakhi, Mother of petitioner Kajal namely Tarawati, mother of petitioner Deepak namely Sapna, petitioner Pooja and petitioner Prem who appeared as PW1 to PW6 respectively categorically deposed that on 23.02.2015 when deceased Vijaypal, Vimlesh and Asha and injured Prem, Kajal, Deepak and Pooja were traveling in van bearing registration No. DL-5CK-4669 and had reached near Murthal over-bridge in the area of Police Station, Murthal, Sonepat, respondent No. 1 who was driving the offending vehicle i.e. Gas Tanker bearing registration No. HR- 38E-6594 in a rash and negligent manner applied sudden breaks as a result of which Maruti Van dashed into the tanker. He further urged that statements of afore-mentioned witnesses are supported by FIR Ex. P17, police report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex. P18, PMR reports Ex. P1, Ex. P2 and Ex. P16, discharge cards Ex. P3, Ex. P6, Ex. P9 and Ex. P15 and medical bills Ex. P4, Ex. P5, Ex. P7, Ex. P8, Ex. P10 to Ex. P14. Thus, he submitted that it is well established that the accident in question was caused due to rash and negligent driving of Tanker bearing registration No. HR- 38E-6594 by respondent No. 1 and while passengers in the Maruti Van namely Vijaypal, Vimlesh, Asha died due to the injuries suffered by them in the accident, other passengers namely Prem, Kajal, Deepak and Pooja suffered multiple injuries. IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 22 20.On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents No.1 & 2 vehemently argued that no accident took place with Tanker bearing registration No. HR-38E-6594 and respondent No. 1 was falsely implicated in the criminal case bearing FIR No. 84 dated 24.02.2015, under Sections 279, 337, 38, 304A IPC, P.S. Murthal. Hence, prayed that all the claim petitions are liable to be dismissed. 21.I have given thoughtful consideration to the arguments put forth by both sides. It is pertinent to note that PW2 Rakhi and PW5 Pooja who had sustained injuries in the accident in question and PW6 Prem who is eye- witness to the accident being passenger in the accidental van specifically deposed that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of Tanker bearing registration No. HR-38E-6594 by respondent No.1 because he applied sudden breaks as a result of which the Maruti Van which was behind the tanker dashed against the tanker. It is also noteworthy that the FIR Ex. P17 regarding the accident was registered on the basis of statement of one eye-witness Amit on the same day and it is recorded in the FIR that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of the above-said tanker. It is further significant to note that during investigation the police found the version of the FIR as correct and filed final report against respondent No. 1 which is Ex. P18. It is also worthwhile to note that IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 23 respondent No.1 did not step into the witness box to rebut the version of the claimants/ petitioners. At this juncture, I may also observe that it is well settled law that proceedings before the MACT are of summary nature and standard of proof in such proceedings is neither preponderance of probabilities as required in a civil case nor proof beyond reasonable doubt as required in criminal trial and for such proceedings the documents prepared by the police may be taken on their face value. For this purpose, reference with advantage is made to law laid down by our Hon'ble Division Bench in “Paramjit Kaur and others versus Nahar Singh and Others” FAO 8848 of 2014 (O&M) and “United India Insurance Company Ltd. Versus Nahar Singh and Others FAO No. 9115 of 2014 (O&M). In given scenario, I am of the considered opinion that it is well proved for the purpose of instant proceedings that the accident in question was caused by respondent No. 1 while driving tanker bearing registration No. HR-38E- 6594 in a rash and negligent manner. 22.It is further important to note that PW2 Rakhi and PW5 Pooja who have sustained injuries in the accident in question and PW6 Prem who is eye-witness categorically testified that Vijaypal, Vimlesh and Asha died due to injuries suffered in the accident while Pooja, Rakhi, Kajal and Deepak suffered injuries. It is also important to note that their depositions IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 24 are corroborated from post-mortem reports Ex. P1, Ex. P2 and Ex. P16 and discharge card with medical bills of injured Rakhi Ex. P3 to Ex. P5, discharge card read with medical bills of Kajal Ex. P6 to Ex. P8, discharge card read with medical bills of Deepak Ex. P9 to Ex.P11 and medical bills and discharge card of Pooja Ex. P12 to Ex. P15. Consequently, it is cogently established that while Vijaypal, Vimlesh and Asha died due to the injuries suffered in the accident, minor Kajal, Rakhi, Pooja and Deepak suffered injuries in the accident. 23.In view of the above discussion, this issue is decided in favour of the claimants/ petitioners and against the respondents. I SSUE No. 2(in all claim petitions) - 24.The onus to prove this issue was upon the claimants/ petitioners. In his arguments learned counsel for the claimants/ petitioners submitted that in view of the statements of Anita, Rakhi, Mother of injured Kajal namely Tarawati, mother of petitioner Deepak namely Sapna, petitioner Pooja and petitioner Prem who appeared as PW1 to PW6 respectively regarding the income and age of the deceased namely Vijaypal, Vimlesh and Asha and injureds Rakhi, Kajal, Pooja and Deepak, the compensation prayed for by the claimants/ petitioners are just and reasonable and may kindly be granted. IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 25 25.On the contrary, learned counsel for the respondents stated that the compensation demanded by the claimants/ petitioners is highly excessive and exorbitant. Furthermore, learned counsel for the respondent No. 3 urged that respondent No. 1 who was driver of the offending tanker bearing registration No. HR-38E-6594 is having two driving licence i.e. one issued by Licencing Authority, RTA, Palwal Ex. RW1/A & D, which was initially valid upto 06.01.2014 and subsequently, renewed from 01.07.2016 till 30.06.2019 while the other driving licence Ex. R1/1 was issued by Regional Transport Officer, Kohima, Nagaland and was valid from 17.11.2014 to 16.11.2017. According to him, the driving licence of respondent No. 1 Ex. R1 is fake and has been procured and produced with mala-fide intention to transfer the liability to pay compensation upon the Insurance Company. He referred to law laid down by our own Hon'ble High Court in Oriental Insurance Com. Ltd. Vs. Nahar Singh and Others FAO NO. 9115 of 2014 (O& M) D.O.D. 21.02.2017. Therefore, he contended that in the circumstances, respondent No. 3 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimants/ petitioners. 26. I have given thoughtful consideration to the submissions made by both sides. As regards the amount of compensation payable in claim petition No. 356 of 2017 titled as ' Anita etc. versus Sant Lal & Others', it IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 26 is pertinent to note that claimants have claimed a compensation of 50 Lacs ₹ on account of death of Vijay Pal in the accident in question. It is further imperative to note that even though, claimant Anita has stated in her affidavit Ex. PW1/A that deceased Vijay Pal was mason by profession and was earning 20,000/- per month but neither any independent witness in ₹ support of such statement has been examined nor any documentary proof to substantiate the said claim has been produced. Accordingly, the income of deceased Vijaypal at the time of his death i.e. on 24.02.2015 can be reasonably inferred at the rate equivalent to minimum wages prevalent at that time i.e. 6,000/- per month. It is also noteworthy that as per the ₹ claimants/petitioners, deceased Vijaypal has left behind a wife, three minor children, father and mother. It is further relevant to mention that father is a second class heir. Moreover, he is supposed to have his own income and there is nothing on file except the bald statement of PW1 Anita that father of deceased Vijaypal was dependent upon him. It is also important to note that in Sarla Verma & Others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & others, 2009 (3) RCR (Civil) 77 , the Hon'ble apex Court ruled that “ Further, subject to evidence to the contrary, the father is likely to have his own income and will not be considered as a dependent and the mother alone will be considered as a dependent” . Thus, the father of deceased Vijaypal IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 27 cannot be considered as dependent on the deceased. Accordingly, there were five dependents on deceased Vijaypal. Hence, 1/4th income of the deceased is liable to be deducted towards personal expenses as per decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Smt. Sarla Verma's case (Supra) . Therefore, the loss of income comes to 54,000/- per annum. At this juncture, I may also observe ₹ that as per post-mortem report , the age of deceased Vijaypal was about 40 years. Therefore, the multiplier of 15 would be applicable. Resultantly, the loss of dependency comes to 54,000/- x 15 = 8,10,000/- (Rupees Eight ₹ Lacs and Ten Thousand Only). 27.Another important aspect of the matter is that since deceased Vijaypal was self employed an addition of 40% of the income is permissible under the Head “Future Prospects” , which comes to 3,24,000/-. ₹ 28.In addition to the above said- amount, the claimants/ petitioners are further entitled to a mount of 15,000/- each ₹ towards loss of estate and funeral expenses of deceased. Moreover, claimants are also entitled to additional amount of 40,000/- under the head of ₹ loss of consortium . Therefore, the total amount of compensation thus comes to 12,04,000/- ₹ out of which claimant No. 1 will be entitled to 40% of the total amount of compensation being widow of deceased Vijaypal while other claimants No. 2 to 4 being sons and daughters of the deceased and claimant No. 6 being IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 28 mother of the deceased are entitled to 15% each of the total amount of compensation. 29.In claim petition No. 357, titled as “Prem & Others Versus Sant Lal & Others” the claimants/ petitioners have claimed a compensation of 50 Lacs on account of death of Vimlesh in the accident in question. In₹ this regard, it is imperative to note that even though, claimant Prem has stated in his affidavit Ex. PW6/A that deceased Vimlesh was labourer by profession and was earning 15,000/- per month but neither any ₹ independent witness in support of such statement has been examined nor any documentary proof to substantiate the said claim has been produced. Accordingly, the income of deceased Vimlesh at the time of her death i.e. on 24.02.2015 can be reasonably inferred at the rate equivalent to minimum wages prevalent at that time i.e. 6,000/- per month. It is also noteworthy ₹ that as per the claimants/petitioners, deceased Vimlesh has left behind her husband and four children. Accordingly, there were five dependents on deceased Vimlesh. Hence, 1/4th income of the deceased is liable to be deducted towards personal expenses as per decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Smt. Sarla Verm's case (Supra) . Therefore, the loss of income comes to 54,000/- per annum. At this juncture, I may also observe that as ₹ per post-mortem report , the age of deceased Vimlesh was about 40 years. IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 29 Therefore, the multiplier of '15' would be applicable. Resultantly, the loss of dependency comes to 54,000/- x 15 = 8,10,000/- (Rupees Eight Lacs and ₹ Ten Thousand Only). 30.Another important aspect of the matter is that since deceased Vimlesh was self employed an addition of 40% of the income is permissible under the Head “ Future Prospects” which comes to 3,24,000/-. ₹ 31.In addition to the above said- amount, the claimants/ petitioners are further entitled to a mount of 15,000/- each towards ₹ loss of estate and funeral expenses of the deceased. Moreover, claimants are also entitled to additional amount of 40,000/- under the head of ₹ loss of consortium . Therefore, the total amount of compensation comes to 12,04,000/- out of ₹ which claimant No. 1 will be entitled to 40% of the total amount of compensation being husband of deceased Vimlesh while other claimants being sons and daughter of the deceased are entitled to 15% each of the total amount of compensation. 32.In claim petition No. 358, titled as “Anita Versus Sant Lal & Others” it is important to note that as per the case set-up by the claimant/ petitioner, deceased Asha was a student of 5th standard at the time of her death. Thus, her notional income can be taken as 30,000/- per annum and ₹ multiplier of “'15” would be applicable. In this regard, reliance is placed IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs.

Sant Lal & others. 30 upon the law laid down by our own Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Krishan Gopal and others Versus Lala and others 2013 (4) RCR (Civil) 276. Resultantly, the loss of income comes to 30,000/- x 15 = 4,50,000/- ₹ (Rupees Four Lacs and Fifty Thousand Only). 33. In addition to the above said amount, the claimant/ petitioner is further entitled to amount of 15,000/- towards ₹ loss of estate and funeral expenses of the deceased. Thus, total compensation comes to 4, ₹ 80,000/-. 34. In claim petition No. 359, titled as “Deepak Versus Sant Lal & Others” it is worthwhile to note that injured Deepak has claimed a compensation of Five Lacs on account of injuries suffered by him in the ₹ accident in question. It is further significant to note that the discharge card of injured Deepak is Ex. P9 wherein it is recorded that he remained admitted in PGIMS, Rohtak from 24.02.2015 to 26.02.2015. It is also relevant to note that the medical bills of the injured in the sum of 14,614/- and 6709/- ₹ ₹ respectively have been proved as Ex. P10 and Ex. P11. Therefore, I am of the considered view that claimant Deepak is entitled to 21,323/- under the ₹ Head “Medical Expenses” . 35.Furthermore, since the accident in question occurred on National Highway within the jurisdiction of District Sonepat and the IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT.

Moreover, as discussed above the injured remained admitted in PGIMS, Rohtak for two days. Accordingly, he must have spent some amount on special diet. Therefore, I am of the considered view that in the absence of any proof of the amount actually spent by the claimant on special diet and transportation, the sum can be reasonably assessed in view of nature of injuries suffered by the claimant as 3,000/-. ₹ 36. It is also important to mention that in view of nature of injuries suffered by him as mentioned in the discharge card Ex. P9, the claimant is also entitled to a reasonable amount under the Head “Pain and Sufferings” which in my opinion comes to 8,000/-. Thus, the total amount of ₹ compensation comes to 32, 323/-. ₹ 37.

It is also important to mention that as per discharge card Ex. P3, the injured suffered three multiple fractures.

It is further significant to mention that keeping in view the fact that respondent No. 1 has two licences, this Tribunal summoned the file of criminal case regarding FIR No. 85 of 2015, under Sections 279, 337, 338, 304A, IPC, Police Station, Murthal so as to ascertain which driving licence was handed over to the police during investigation of that case and a perusal of the file of the criminal case revealed that during the investigation, a copy of driving licence Ex. RW1/B & D was handed over to the police as the original of the same was already placed on the file of case bearing FIR No. 218 dated 01.08.2013, under sections 279 and 304 A IPC, P.S. Kharkhoda. Hence, it is crystal clear that respondent No. 1 relied upon driving licence issued by Licencing Authority, Palwal in the criminal case registered against him regarding the accident in question. However, during instant proceedings, he alongwith owner of the offending vehicle have relied upon driving licence Ex. R1/1 which is issued by the Regional Transport Officer, Kohima, IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 37 Nagland. As already discussed above, the driving licence Ex. RW1/B & D was not valid on the day of accident. At this juncture, I may also observe that the possibility of obtaining a driving licence by respondent No. 1 from the State of Nagaland after expiry of his driving licence Ex. RW1/B & D for future purposes is ruled out from the fact that he got his licence Ex. RW1/B & D renewed from 01.07.2016 to 30.06.2019 because if respondent No. 1 had taken licence Ex. R1/1 from the State of Nagaland in view of the fact that his earlier driving licence Ex. RW1/B & D had expired, he would not have got his said licence renewed during the validity of licence Ex. R1/1. It is further important to note that respondent No. 1 is local resident of Palwal. Thus, there was no reason for him to apply and get his driving licence from the State of Nagaland. In similar circumstances, our own Hon'ble High Court in case titled as Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. Versus Nahar Singh and Other's case (Supra) while taking note of Section 6 (I) of the M.V. Act 1998, which prohibits any person from holding more than one driving licence held “that the licence produced by the driver subsequently had been issued from Nagaland, which is not the ordinary place of residence of the driver, therefore, the Court can take notice of this fact that the licence has been managed from a different area with a view to overcome the liability in such cases. The driver could not hold two licences and the IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs.

Therefore, the insurance company could not have been made liable.” 48.In these facts and circumstances of the case, it can be safely concluded that the insurance company-respondent No. 3 is not liable to indemnify the insured. Consequently, the respondent No.1, who was driver of the offending vehicle and respondent No. 2 who is the owner of the offending vehicle are held jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation to the claimants/ petitioners. However, respondent No. 3 i.e. insurance company shall be liable to pay the compensation to the claimants/ petitioners with liberty to recover the same from respondents No. 1 & 2 as per decision of Hon'ble apex Court in National Insurance Company Ltd. Versus Swaran Singh and others I (2004) CLT 1. 49. Both these issues stand disposed of in view of above observations accordingly. ISSUES No. 3 & 4 (in all petitions) - 50.In view of discussion above, it is held that insurance company shall deposit the amount of compensation in the first instance and shall remain at liberty to recover the said amount from the insured, either in the execution filed by the claimant himself/ herself or by moving separate IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT.

Respondent No. 3 is directed to deposite the amount of compensation in the bank accounts of major claimants on submission of particulars of their bank accounts alongwith their pass-books within 15 days failing which the amount shall be deposited by way of demand draft/cheque in the name of claimants within three months. The amount of share of minor claimants shall be invested in fixed deposits in any Nationalised bank fetching maximum rate of interest for such period that the fixed deposits shall mature after attaining majority by the minor claimants.

Thereafter, respondents closed their evidence vide separate statement. 17.No evidence in rebuttal evidence was led by the petitioners. 18.I have gone through the case file very carefully and minutely and heard the arguments put-forth by both the sides. My issue-wise findings are as under - ISSUE No. 1 : 19. Onus to prove this issue was upon the petitioners. Initiating arguments, learned counsel for the claimants/petitioners vehemently IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 21 contended that petitioners Anita, Rakhi, Mother of petitioner Kajal namely Tarawati, mother of petitioner Deepak namely Sapna, petitioner Pooja and petitioner Prem who appeared as PW1 to PW6 respectively categorically deposed that on 23.02.2015 when deceased Vijaypal, Vimlesh and Asha and injured Prem, Kajal, Deepak and Pooja were traveling in van bearing registration No. DL-5CK-4669 and had reached near Murthal over-bridge in the area of Police Station, Murthal, Sonepat, respondent No. 1 who was driving the offending vehicle i.e. Gas Tanker bearing registration No. HR- 38E-6594 in a rash and negligent manner applied sudden breaks as a result of which Maruti Van dashed into the tanker. He further urged that statements of afore-mentioned witnesses are supported by FIR Ex. P17, police report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex. P18, PMR reports Ex. P1, Ex. P2 and Ex. P16, discharge cards Ex. P3, Ex. P6, Ex. P9 and Ex. P15 and medical bills Ex. P4, Ex. P5, Ex. P7, Ex. P8, Ex. P10 to Ex. P14. Thus, he submitted that it is well established that the accident in question was caused due to rash and negligent driving of Tanker bearing registration No. HR- 38E-6594 by respondent No. 1 and while passengers in the Maruti Van namely Vijaypal, Vimlesh, Asha died due to the injuries suffered by them in the accident, other passengers namely Prem, Kajal, Deepak and Pooja suffered multiple injuries. IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 22 20.On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents No.1 & 2 vehemently argued that no accident took place with Tanker bearing registration No. HR-38E-6594 and respondent No. 1 was falsely implicated in the criminal case bearing FIR No. 84 dated 24.02.2015, under Sections 279, 337, 38, 304A IPC, P.S. Murthal. Hence, prayed that all the claim petitions are liable to be dismissed. 21.I have given thoughtful consideration to the arguments put forth by both sides. It is pertinent to note that PW2 Rakhi and PW5 Pooja who had sustained injuries in the accident in question and PW6 Prem who is eye- witness to the accident being passenger in the accidental van specifically deposed that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of Tanker bearing registration No. HR-38E-6594 by respondent No.1 because he applied sudden breaks as a result of which the Maruti Van which was behind the tanker dashed against the tanker. It is also noteworthy that the FIR Ex. P17 regarding the accident was registered on the basis of statement of one eye-witness Amit on the same day and it is recorded in the FIR that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of the above-said tanker. It is further significant to note that during investigation the police found the version of the FIR as correct and filed final report against respondent No. 1 which is Ex. P18. It is also worthwhile to note that IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 23 respondent No.1 did not step into the witness box to rebut the version of the claimants/ petitioners. At this juncture, I may also observe that it is well settled law that proceedings before the MACT are of summary nature and standard of proof in such proceedings is neither preponderance of probabilities as required in a civil case nor proof beyond reasonable doubt as required in criminal trial and for such proceedings the documents prepared by the police may be taken on their face value. For this purpose, reference with advantage is made to law laid down by our Hon'ble Division Bench in “Paramjit Kaur and others versus Nahar Singh and Others” FAO 8848 of 2014 (O&M) and “United India Insurance Company Ltd. Versus Nahar Singh and Others FAO No. 9115 of 2014 (O&M). In given scenario, I am of the considered opinion that it is well proved for the purpose of instant proceedings that the accident in question was caused by respondent No. 1 while driving tanker bearing registration No. HR-38E- 6594 in a rash and negligent manner. 22.It is further important to note that PW2 Rakhi and PW5 Pooja who have sustained injuries in the accident in question and PW6 Prem who is eye-witness categorically testified that Vijaypal, Vimlesh and Asha died due to injuries suffered in the accident while Pooja, Rakhi, Kajal and Deepak suffered injuries. It is also important to note that their depositions IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 24 are corroborated from post-mortem reports Ex. P1, Ex. P2 and Ex. P16 and discharge card with medical bills of injured Rakhi Ex. P3 to Ex. P5, discharge card read with medical bills of Kajal Ex. P6 to Ex. P8, discharge card read with medical bills of Deepak Ex. P9 to Ex.P11 and medical bills and discharge card of Pooja Ex. P12 to Ex. P15. Consequently, it is cogently established that while Vijaypal, Vimlesh and Asha died due to the injuries suffered in the accident, minor Kajal, Rakhi, Pooja and Deepak suffered injuries in the accident. 23.In view of the above discussion, this issue is decided in favour of the claimants/ petitioners and against the respondents. I SSUE No. 2(in all claim petitions) - 24.The onus to prove this issue was upon the claimants/ petitioners. In his arguments learned counsel for the claimants/ petitioners submitted that in view of the statements of Anita, Rakhi, Mother of injured Kajal namely Tarawati, mother of petitioner Deepak namely Sapna, petitioner Pooja and petitioner Prem who appeared as PW1 to PW6 respectively regarding the income and age of the deceased namely Vijaypal, Vimlesh and Asha and injureds Rakhi, Kajal, Pooja and Deepak, the compensation prayed for by the claimants/ petitioners are just and reasonable and may kindly be granted. IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 25 25.On the contrary, learned counsel for the respondents stated that the compensation demanded by the claimants/ petitioners is highly excessive and exorbitant. Furthermore, learned counsel for the respondent No. 3 urged that respondent No. 1 who was driver of the offending tanker bearing registration No. HR-38E-6594 is having two driving licence i.e. one issued by Licencing Authority, RTA, Palwal Ex. RW1/A & D, which was initially valid upto 06.01.2014 and subsequently, renewed from 01.07.2016 till 30.06.2019 while the other driving licence Ex. R1/1 was issued by Regional Transport Officer, Kohima, Nagaland and was valid from 17.11.2014 to 16.11.2017. According to him, the driving licence of respondent No. 1 Ex. R1 is fake and has been procured and produced with mala-fide intention to transfer the liability to pay compensation upon the Insurance Company. He referred to law laid down by our own Hon'ble High Court in Oriental Insurance Com. Ltd. Vs. Nahar Singh and Others FAO NO. 9115 of 2014 (O& M) D.O.D. 21.02.2017. Therefore, he contended that in the circumstances, respondent No. 3 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimants/ petitioners. 26. I have given thoughtful consideration to the submissions made by both sides. As regards the amount of compensation payable in claim petition No. 356 of 2017 titled as ' Anita etc. versus Sant Lal & Others', it IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 26 is pertinent to note that claimants have claimed a compensation of 50 Lacs ₹ on account of death of Vijay Pal in the accident in question. It is further imperative to note that even though, claimant Anita has stated in her affidavit Ex. PW1/A that deceased Vijay Pal was mason by profession and was earning 20,000/- per month but neither any independent witness in ₹ support of such statement has been examined nor any documentary proof to substantiate the said claim has been produced. Accordingly, the income of deceased Vijaypal at the time of his death i.e. on 24.02.2015 can be reasonably inferred at the rate equivalent to minimum wages prevalent at that time i.e. 6,000/- per month. It is also noteworthy that as per the ₹ claimants/petitioners, deceased Vijaypal has left behind a wife, three minor children, father and mother. It is further relevant to mention that father is a second class heir. Moreover, he is supposed to have his own income and there is nothing on file except the bald statement of PW1 Anita that father of deceased Vijaypal was dependent upon him. It is also important to note that in Sarla Verma & Others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & others, 2009 (3) RCR (Civil) 77 , the Hon'ble apex Court ruled that “ Further, subject to evidence to the contrary, the father is likely to have his own income and will not be considered as a dependent and the mother alone will be considered as a dependent” . Thus, the father of deceased Vijaypal IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 27 cannot be considered as dependent on the deceased. Accordingly, there were five dependents on deceased Vijaypal. Hence, 1/4th income of the deceased is liable to be deducted towards personal expenses as per decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Smt. Sarla Verma's case (Supra) . Therefore, the loss of income comes to 54,000/- per annum. At this juncture, I may also observe ₹ that as per post-mortem report , the age of deceased Vijaypal was about 40 years. Therefore, the multiplier of 15 would be applicable. Resultantly, the loss of dependency comes to 54,000/- x 15 = 8,10,000/- (Rupees Eight ₹ Lacs and Ten Thousand Only). 27.Another important aspect of the matter is that since deceased Vijaypal was self employed an addition of 40% of the income is permissible under the Head “Future Prospects” , which comes to 3,24,000/-. ₹ 28.In addition to the above said- amount, the claimants/ petitioners are further entitled to a mount of 15,000/- each ₹ towards loss of estate and funeral expenses of deceased. Moreover, claimants are also entitled to additional amount of 40,000/- under the head of ₹ loss of consortium . Therefore, the total amount of compensation thus comes to 12,04,000/- ₹ out of which claimant No. 1 will be entitled to 40% of the total amount of compensation being widow of deceased Vijaypal while other claimants No. 2 to 4 being sons and daughters of the deceased and claimant No. 6 being IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT.

In₹ this regard, it is imperative to note that even though, claimant Prem has stated in his affidavit Ex. PW6/A that deceased Vimlesh was labourer by profession and was earning 15,000/- per month but neither any ₹ independent witness in support of such statement has been examined nor any documentary proof to substantiate the said claim has been produced. Accordingly, the income of deceased Vimlesh at the time of her death i.e. on 24.02.2015 can be reasonably inferred at the rate equivalent to minimum wages prevalent at that time i.e. 6,000/- per month. It is also noteworthy ₹ that as per the claimants/petitioners, deceased Vimlesh has left behind her husband and four children. Accordingly, there were five dependents on deceased Vimlesh. Hence, 1/4th income of the deceased is liable to be deducted towards personal expenses as per decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Smt. Sarla Verm's case (Supra) . Therefore, the loss of income comes to 54,000/- per annum. At this juncture, I may also observe that as ₹ per post-mortem report , the age of deceased Vimlesh was about 40 years.

In claim petition No. 359, titled as “Deepak Versus Sant Lal & Others” it is worthwhile to note that injured Deepak has claimed a compensation of Five Lacs on account of injuries suffered by him in the ₹ accident in question. It is further significant to note that the discharge card of injured Deepak is Ex. P9 wherein it is recorded that he remained admitted in PGIMS, Rohtak from 24.02.2015 to 26.02.2015.

Moreover, as discussed above the injured remained admitted in PGIMS, Rohtak for two days. Accordingly, he must have spent some amount on special diet. Therefore, I am of the considered view that in the absence of any proof of the amount actually spent by the claimant on special diet and transportation, the sum can be reasonably assessed in view of nature of injuries suffered by the claimant as 3,000/-. ₹ 36. It is also important to mention that in view of nature of injuries suffered by him as mentioned in the discharge card Ex.

In this regard, it is imperative to note that respondent No.1, who was driver of the offending vehicle at the time of accident is having two IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others.

RW1/B & D which was initially valid from 07.12.2005 to 06.01.2014 for transport vehicles and which has been subsequently renewed for the period 01.07.2016 to 30.06.2019 as per deposition of RW2 Rajender Singh, Transport Inspector, RTA, Palwal and driving licence Ex. R1/1 which is issued by Regional Transport Officer, Kohima, Nagaland which was valid from 17.11.2014 to 16.11.2017. It is further significant to mention that keeping in view the fact that respondent No. 1 has two licences, this Tribunal summoned the file of criminal case regarding FIR No. 85 of 2015, under Sections 279, 337, 338, 304A, IPC, Police Station, Murthal so as to ascertain which driving licence was handed over to the police during investigation of that case and a perusal of the file of the criminal case revealed that during the investigation, a copy of driving licence Ex. RW1/B & D was handed over to the police as the original of the same was already placed on the file of case bearing FIR No. 218 dated 01.08.2013, under sections 279 and 304 A IPC, P.S. Kharkhoda. Hence, it is crystal clear that respondent No. 1 relied upon driving licence issued by Licencing Authority, Palwal in the criminal case registered against him regarding the accident in question. However, during instant proceedings, he alongwith owner of the offending vehicle have relied upon driving licence Ex. R1/1 which is issued by the Regional Transport Officer, Kohima, IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 37 Nagland. As already discussed above, the driving licence Ex. RW1/B & D was not valid on the day of accident. At this juncture, I may also observe that the possibility of obtaining a driving licence by respondent No. 1 from the State of Nagaland after expiry of his driving licence Ex. RW1/B & D for future purposes is ruled out from the fact that he got his licence Ex. RW1/B & D renewed from 01.07.2016 to 30.06.2019 because if respondent No. 1 had taken licence Ex. R1/1 from the State of Nagaland in view of the fact that his earlier driving licence Ex. RW1/B & D had expired, he would not have got his said licence renewed during the validity of licence Ex. R1/1. It is further important to note that respondent No. 1 is local resident of Palwal. Thus, there was no reason for him to apply and get his driving licence from the State of Nagaland. In similar circumstances, our own Hon'ble High Court in case titled as Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. Versus Nahar Singh and Other's case (Supra) while taking note of Section 6 (I) of the M.V. Act 1998, which prohibits any person from holding more than one driving licence held “that the licence produced by the driver subsequently had been issued from Nagaland, which is not the ordinary place of residence of the driver, therefore, the Court can take notice of this fact that the licence has been managed from a different area with a view to overcome the liability in such cases. The driver could not hold two licences and the IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs.

Therefore, the insurance company could not have been made liable.” 48.In these facts and circumstances of the case, it can be safely concluded that the insurance company-respondent No. 3 is not liable to indemnify the insured. Consequently, the respondent No.1, who was driver of the offending vehicle and respondent No. 2 who is the owner of the offending vehicle are held jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation to the claimants/ petitioners. However, respondent No. 3 i.e. insurance company shall be liable to pay the compensation to the claimants/ petitioners with liberty to recover the same from respondents No. 1 & 2 as per decision of Hon'ble apex Court in National Insurance Company Ltd.

I have appraised the evidence on record, the material circumstances of the case and the arguments addressed by the learned counsel for the parties. My findings on the aforesaid issues are as under: Issue No.1: 10.In order to prove this issue, Sonu (eye-witness) stepped into the witness box as PW2 and reiterated the averments as mentioned in the petition. He deposed that the Tralla was wrongly parked on the road without any indicator or any indication to warn the traffic coming from back. He stated that he tried his level best and when he applied emergency brake Raman received multiple injuries on his body and he was shifted to Govt hospital where he was declared dead by the doctor concerned. Raj Rani etc vs Pawan etc 6 He stated that accident took place due to the sole carelessness on the part of respondent no.1, who had parked his vehicle on the road. 11.Raj Rani appeared as PW1 and tendered affidavit Ex PW1/A reiterating the contents as mentioned in the petition. In cross-examination she stated that accident took place due to sole negligence on the part of respondent no.1. She deposed that she has two children. She deposed that they were dependents on the income of deceased. She spent Rs 50,000/- on the last rites of her deceased husband. 12. It is the case of the petitioners that 22.3.2015 Raman Kumar ( since deceased) alongwith one Sonu and Babu Lal had started from village Lehal Pind for Delhi after loading the domestic goods in it. The said vehicle was being driven by Sonu, whereas deceased Raman Kumar was sitting on the conductor seat of that vehicle as he was working as conductor on that vehicle. When at about 4.00 A.M on 23.3.2015, they reached on NH-1, GT Road within the area of police station Kundli, the offending tralla bearing registration no. HR 46B-6946 was found parked on the road without any indicator, indication or traffic signal etc and because of that, the vehicle of Sonu gave a hit to the back side of the offending vehicle parked on GT road. Although Sonu applied emergency brake of his vehicle but due to hit Raman Kumar received multiple injuries and he was shifted to Govt, Hospital Sonepat where he was declared dead. It has been submitted that the accident took place due to Raj Rani etc vs Pawan etc 7 sole carelessness on the part of respondent no.1 who wrongly parked his vehicle on the road. In order to prove the same the petitioners have examined Sonu (eye- witness) who proved that the accident took place due to wrong parking of Tralla in the middle of the road by respondent no.1. PW1 also corroborated the version of PW2. 13.This oral as well as documentary evidence of the petitioners has gone completely un-rebutted and unchallenged. A perusal of copy of the first information report Ex P6 and report under section 173 Cr.PC Ex. P7 shows that the case regarding the accident in question was registered on the basis of statement of PW2 Sonu eye -witness of the alleged accident. The registration number of the Tralla involved in the accident was mentioned as HR 46B-6946. The version put forth in the first information report regarding the factum and manner of the accident is entirely in consonance with the statement of PW2 Sonu. He categorically stated that the accident in question had taken place due to wrong parking of the Tralla bearing registration no. HR 46B-6946. 14.In the present case accident took place due to the fault of the respondent no.1 by parking his Tralla bearing registration no. HR 46B- 6946 on the main road without placing any signal or indicator on the road. Respondent no.1, who was driver of the offending Tralla has not appeared in the witness-box to claim that accident occurred due to the Raj Rani etc vs Pawan etc 8 contributory negligence of the vehicle bearing registration no. PB-06F- 9586, in which deceased Raman was travelling. 15On the other hand, PW2 Sonu, was driving the vehicle no. PB-06F-9586 and his evidence cannot be brushed aside, merely on the basis of some suggestion given in the cross-examination. In the FIR Ex P6 it is clearly mentioned that accident occurred due to fault of respondent no.1 by parking his vehicle on the road without giving any signal or indicator. In the authority titled as The National Insurance Co.Ltd. Vs Smt. Kamaljit Kaur and others 2013 (1) RCR (civil) 182, it has been held that Truck was parked in the middle of the road without any parking light or indicator and this act itself is sufficient to hold that driver was negligent. The authority titled as Smt Ginni Devi and others vs Union of India and others 2007 (3) PLR 685 can be also referred , in which car driver was not held negligent who struck his car from behind to a stationary Truck parked on the road. 16.The above mentioned authorities are applicable to the facts of the present case and in the present case FIR was registered on the statement of PW2 Sonu against respondent no.1 and due to the wrong parking of the Tralla bearing registration no. HR 46B-6946 on the road, the accident took place, in which deceased Raman lost his life. In these circumstances, petitioners, who are legal heirs of deceased are entitled to Raj Rani etc vs Pawan etc 9 get compensation from the respondents being driver, owner and insurer of the Tralla bearing registration no. HR 46B-6946. In view of above discussion, issue no.1 is decided in favour of the petitioners. Issue Nos. 2, 17 In the claim petition, it has been submitted that deceased was 38 years of age at the time of his death. To prove the age of deceased the petitioners have placed on record Ex P1, in which year of birth of deceased has been mentioned as 1976. In the post mortem report also age of Raman is mentioned as 38 years. The medical evidence of doctor who conducted post mortem on the dead body of Raman cannot be discarded. Therefore, for the purpose of assessing compensation, it would be proper to consider the age of the deceased as 38 years at the time of his death. 18.Now, coming to the dependency, petitioner no.1 Raj Rani is wife, petitioners no. 2 and 3 are minor children and petitioner no.4 is mother of the deceased. PW1 Raj Rani deposed that they were dependant on the income of the deceased and after his death they have no source of income. In the claim petition, it has been submitted that the deceased was earning Rs 12,000/- per month. PW2 Sonu has also deposed so that deceased was earning Rs. 12,000/- per month. The petitioners have not placed any document on record to prove that deceased was working as conductor on the tralla. During cross Raj Rani etc vs Pawan etc 10 examination PW2 deposed that he has no proof regarding the income of deceased Raman. In the absence of any proof it cannot be said that the Raman (deceased) was earning Rs 12,000/- per month as alleged Nevertheless he was a young man and could have earn sufficient monthly income to maintain his family. Therefore, the income of the deceased is to be considered at par with a male casual labourer. Accordingly, for the purpose of assessing the compensation, the income of deceased is assessed at Rs.8,000/- per month. In view of authority titled as Munna Lal Jain vs Vipin Kumar Sharma 2015(6) SCC 347 and Shri Ram General Insurance Company Limited vs Karnail Kaur and others 2015-4, PLR 324, the deceased being of 38 years of age at the time of his death, 50% income earned by him is to be added as prospects of future income and considering the age of deceased the total income of the deceased after adding 50% of the income comes to Rs. 12,000/- per month i.e. 1,44,000/- per year. It has also been laid down by the Apex Court in Smt. Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transportation Corporation and another 2009 (3) PLR 22 , where the deceased was married, the deduction towards personal and living expenses of the deceased should be one third where the number of dependant family members is 2 to 3, one fourth where the number of the dependant family members is 4 to 6 and one fifth where the number of dependant family members exceeds six. Therefore, after deducting one fourth of the income of the deceased as her personal expenses, contribution towards his family comes to Rs. 1,08,000/-per year. As per law laid down in Smt. Sarla Raj Rani etc vs Pawan etc 11 Verma and others’ case 2009-3, PLR 22 the multiplier to be applied is of 15. So, the compensation after applying multiplier of 15 comes to 1,08,000x15=16,20,000/- 19The petitioners might have suffered some expenses on the last rites of the deceased besides suffering loss of estate. As per law laid down in Rajesh and others vs Rajbir Singh and others 2013 (3) RCR (Civil) 170(SC), petitioner's wife is awarded an amount of Rs.1,00,000/- towards loss of consortium. The petitioners are further allowed Rs.25,000/- towards funeral expenses and Rs 1,00,000/- are granted for love and affection to the children of the deceased. Thus, the total amount payable to the petitioners comes to Rs.18,45,000/- . Issue no.2 is decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUE No.3 20. To substantiate this issue, no evidence was led by respondent No.3 insurance company to prove that offending vehicle was being driven by respondent No.1 in contravention of the terms and conditions of insurance policy. Copy of driving licence Ex.R-1 was produced, from which, it stands proved on record that Ex.R-1was issued by Licencing Authority, and is valid for driving the motorcycle, LMV, Transport, MCWG etc and as such the said driving licence Ex.R1 is meant for driving heavy vehicle etc. Further a perusal of Ex R5 insurance policy reveals that the vehicle in question was insured with the respondent no.3. In the written statement respondent no.3 has not taken Raj Rani etc vs Pawan etc 12 the plea that the vehicle bearing registration no. HR 46B-6946 was not insured with respondent no.3 at the time of accident. RELIEF: 21In view of the findings of this Tribunal returned on the issues under adjudication, present petition succeeds and same is accepted with costs and claimants are held entitled to compensation of Rs. 18,45,000/-. (Eighteen lacs and forty five thousand only) in equal shares, on account of death of Raman , which shall be payable by all the respondents jointly and severally, but the first charge shall always remain with respondent No.3 insurance company.

AWARD: Present claim petition has been filed by the dependents of deceased, who lost his life in a motor vehicle accident, which took place on 27.08.2015. 2. It is submitted that on 27.08.2015 deceased Satbir along with his brother Balraj were going to their fields for irrigating and at about 9.00 p.m. when Satbir and his brother were moving towards their fields on G.T Road, in the meantime a car bearing registration No.HR-55V-4626 (hereinafter referred to as the offending vehicle) came from the side of Panipat being driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner at a very fast speed and dashed Satbir from the back side.

That the driver of the offending vehicle after parking the same at a some distance fled away from the spot. That thereafter brother of Satbir after arranging vehicle shifted him to General Hospital, Sonipat where during treatment, Satbir succumbed to his injuries. It has been further pleaded that the accident in question took place due to sole rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 and FIR No.367 dated 28.08.2015 under Sections 279, 304-A IPC was got registered by P.S. Murthal, Sonipat. 3. It is alleged that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by the respondent No.1, which is owned by the respondent No.2 and is insured with the respondent No.3.

It has been further asserted that the income of the deceased has been shown much exaggerated and without any basis. Further asserted that a false FIR has been registered against the respondent No.1. While denying remaining averments, dismissal of petition with costs has been prayed for. 6.

Further it has been asserted that there was no rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent No.1/driver and the alleged accident took place due to the fault of deceased Satbir himself, who was walking on the busy road in the night hours without caring for the vehicles running on the road. Further asserted that no intimation as required under Section 134 (c) of the Motor Vehicles Act was given to the Insurance Company by the respondents No.1 and 2. It has been further asserted that respondent No.1 was not having any Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 4 driving licence at the time of accident. On merits, it has been asserted that a false FIR was lodged by the brother of deceased against the respondent No.1. Further asserted that the amount of compensation claimed by the petitioners is highly exaggerated and without any basis. Rests of the assertions are denied and it is prayed for dismissing the claim petition with heavy costs. 7. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed on 07.09.2016 : - 1.Whether the death of Satbir son of Daya Nand is the result of accident which took place on 27.08.2015 due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle i.e. Car bearing No.HR-55V-4626 by respondent No.1? OPP. 2.If issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation, the claimants / petitioners are entitled to and from whom? OPP. 3.Whether respondent No.1 was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident and the offending vehicle had violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect? OPR- 3. 4.Relief. 8. In order to prove their case, claimant No.1 Daya Nand himself appeared into the witness box as PW-1 and examined Balraj author of FIR and eye witness of the occurrence as PW-2, Sunil Kumar, Accounts Manager as PW-3, besides relying upon documentary evidence. 9. On the other hand, the respondents have not led any oral evidence and placed reliance upon some documentary evidence. Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 5 10. I have appraised the evidence on record, the material circumstances of the case and the arguments addressed by learned counsel for the parties. My findings on the aforesaid issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1 11. In support of this issue, claimant, namely, Daya Nand (father of deceased) himself appeared into the witness box as PW-1 and reiterated his stand taken in the petition by tendering his duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW-1/A. He has duly given the manner in which the accident took place while deposing completely on the lines of the petition. Further petitioners examined PW-2/Balraj who is author of FIR as well as eye witness to the accident in question. PW-2/Balraj tendered into evidence his duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW-2/A thereby deposing about the manner of accident and also corroborated the facts mentioned in the claim petition. Further petitioners have placed on record copy of post mortem report as Ex.P-1, copy of FIR as Ex.P-2, authorization letter of PW-3 as Ex.P-3, salary slip of deceased as Ex.P-4, certified copy of report under section 173 Cr.P.C. as Ex.P-5, certified copy of driving licence of respondent Hemant Kumar as PW-6, certified copy of registration certificate of the offending vehicle as Ex.P-7, copy of contract carriage permit as Ex.P-8, copies of token tax (road tax) as Ex.P-9 and Ex.P-10, copies of insurance policy as Ex.P-11 and Ex.P-12. 12. To rebut the claim of the petitioners qua negligence of respondent No.1 in causing the accident in question, respondents have failed to lead any evidence. Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 6 13. It is settled law that it is the entire responsibility of the claimants to establish that the driver of the offending vehicle was driving the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner, which resulted into the accident. Further, with regard to standard of proof, it has been held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Parmeshwari Devi vs. Amir Chand and others, 2011(2) RCR (Civil)153, that in a claim pertaining to a road accident, the strict principles of proof in a criminal case are not attracted and that the claimants are merely to establish their case on the touch-stone of preponderance of probabilities. With the above discussed law and evidence on record, this Tribunal is satisfied that the claimants have succeeded in establishing that on 27.08.2015 the offending vehicle was being driven by respondent No.1 in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident in question. PW-2/Balraj duly d eposed about the manner of accident, which finds corroboration vide Ex.P-2 copy of FIR. The deposition of PW-2 qua negligence of the driver of the offending vehicle remained unrebutted. PW-2 has consistently deposed that respondent No.1 had caused the accident in question & was caused on account of his rash and negligent driving and respondents have failed to impeach the testimony of PW-2. Moreover, had the accident not been caused by negligent driving of respondent No.1, then there would have been no reason on the part of PW-2 to lodge the FIR and to appear as a witness against him. Further, from the perusal of Ex.P-1 it transpires that registration number of the offending vehicle has been specifically mentioned in the FIR and it is further alleged that the accident in question has been caused due to rash and negligent driving of its driver. Though Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 7 respondent No.1 has taken specific plea in the reply that accident was not caused by him and the offending vehicle has been falsely implicated in the present case, however respondent No.1 has failed to fortify his assertion and failed to rebut the testimony of the claimants. H ad the accident not taken place as alleged by the petitioners, respondent No.1 would certainly have made complaints to the higher authorities regarding false implication of the offending vehicle with regard to the accident, but no such event happened. Therefore, the evidence coming on record proves rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 in causing the accident in question. This Tribunal does not see any reason to disbelieve the evidence produced by the petitioners. In such circumstances, it is held that petitioners have proved that the accident in question had been caused due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No.1, on the touch stone of preponderance of probabilities. This issue is accordingly decided in favour of petitioners and against the respondents. ISSUES NO.2 & 3 14.Both these issues are inter-linked and inter-connected, therefore, the same are being taken up together for disposal. 15. It has been argued on behalf of the claimants that deceased was 40 years of age at the time of accident and was drawing a salary of Rs.12,000/- per month as he was serving as production Supervisor in Supreme Surfactants Pvt. Ltd., HSIDC, Bari, Sonipat. Further argued that deceased was also doing agricultural work and used to earn Rs.20,000/- per month. Learned counsel for the claimants also referred to the Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 8 statements of PW-1/Daya Nand (father of deceased), who has categorically deposed that petitioners were fully dependent upon the income of the deceased and now they have no source of income. It is therefore, prayed for allowing just compensation, so that the loss of income may be fairly compensated to the dependents of deceased. 16.On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents have prayed for only assessing just compensation to the claimants. It is argued that the income of deceased Satbir as Rs.32,000/- per month claimed by the claimants is exaggerated, whereas no authentic proof has been placed on record to prove his aforesaid income. Therefore, it is argued that at best, the monthly income of deceased Satbir can be taken as that of a daily wage earner and multiplier be adopted accordingly. 17. After having heard learned counsel on behalf of all the parties and perusing the record carefully, it may be observed that proceedings before Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal are of summary nature and strict provisions of Indian Evidence Act are not applicable to it and the probative value of the documents may not be suspected without any reasonable cause. Reference, in this regard may be made to National Insurance Co. Vs Saloni Dargan and others 1990 ACJ 127. The assessment of compensation involves guess work, hypothesis, consideration and sympathy of the tribunal as has been held in R.D.Hattangadi Vs Pest Control (India) Pvt.Ltd.1995 ACJ 366(SC). The compensation can be granted in the following heads: 1)Pecuniary loss: Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 9 a)medical expenses; b)Loss of earning and c)other material loss. 2)Non pecuniary loss: a)damage for pain and suffering; b)damages for loss of amenities of life c)damages for loss of expectation of life d)Inconvenience, hardship, discomfort, disappointment, frustration and mental stress in life. 18. At the time of death of deceased Satbir age of deceased was mentioned in the petition as 40 years and copy of postmortem examination report/Ex.P-1 also shows his age as 40 years. Thus, it is held that age of deceased was 40 years at the time of accident. Thereafter, as per observations of Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in case Sarla Verma and others Vs Delhi Transport Corporation and another 2009(3) RCR (Civil) 77 , multiplier of 15 should be adopted. 19. Now coming to the dependency, claimant No.1/Daya Nand is father and claimant No.2/Phullo Devi is the mother of the deceased. PW- 1/Daya Nand father of deceased has deposed that he alongwith his wife were fully dependent upon the income of the deceased. Thus, the claimants being dependents of the deceased are held entitled to get compensation for the death of their son in the ill-fated accident. 20. As per deposition of PW-1 deceased Satbir was getting a salary of Rs.12,000/- per month at the time of his death while he was Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 10 working as Supervisor in Supreme Surfactants Pvt. Ltd. HSIDC, Bari, Sonipat. This witness further deposed that his son Satbir was also doing the agricultural work and used to earn Rs.20,000/- per month. Evidence of PW-1 regarding doing job as Supervisor and getting salary of Rs.12,000/-, has been corroborated by PW-3/Sunil Kumar, Accounts Manager, Supreme Surfactants Pvt. Ltd. HSIDC who deposed that deceased Satbir was working as Production Supervisor in their company and he was earning Rs.12,000/- per month and proved the salary slip as Ex.P-4. However, in his cross-examination he deposed that neither he has brought any identity card nor any personal file of deceased Satbir maintained by the company. Further this witness deposed that no TDS was being deducted from the salary of deceased Satbir as no TDS was made out on the salary of deceased. Further petitioners have failed to place on record the appointment letter, identity card and attendance certificate regarding employment of deceased Satbir. Hence, it is clearly made out that no authentic proof has been placed on record by the petitioners regarding the employment of deceased Satbir with the abovesaid company except the salary slip for the month of August, 2015. Therefore, in absence of any authentic proof, income of deceased Satbir will have to be considered as that of a daily wage earner as Rs.8,000/- per month. In view of law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Rajesh and others versus Rajbir Singh and others, 2013(3) R C R (SC) 170 as well as keeping in view the age of deceased, 30% of income is to be added as future prospectus. Therefore, monthly income of the deceased is presumed to be 10,400/-. As per ₹ Sarla Verma's case (supra) a cut Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 11 of 1/2 may be applied as his personal expenses, which the deceased would have spent on himself being bachelor, had he been alive. As such, a sum of Rs.5,200/- will be taken as the amount which he would have spent upon his family. Hence, annual dependency comes to Rs.62,400/- (Rs.5,200 x 12/-). When this amount is multiplied by multiplier of 15, it comes to Rs.9,36,000/- (Rs.62,400/- x 15). 21. Moreover, in case Rajesh and others versus Rajbir Singh and others, (Supra) , the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the Tribunal is to award at least Rs.25,000/- towards funeral expenses. It has been further held that the Tribunals have been quite frugal with regard to award of compensation under the head 'Funeral Expenses'. The 'Price Index', it is a fact has gone up in that regard also. The head 'Funeral Expenses' does not mean the fee paid in the crematorium or fee paid for the use of space in the cemetery. There are many other expenses in connection with funeral and, if the deceased is follower of any particular religion, there are several religious practices and conventions pursuant to death in a family. All those are quite expensive. Thus, in view of the same, the claimant is entitled to Rs.25,000/- on account of last rites; Rs.10,000/- on account of transportation and Rs.1,00,000/- on account of love and affection. 22. Thus, the total amount of compensation is assessed at Rs.9,36,000/- + Rs.1,35,000/- = Rs.10,71,000/-, awarded to the claimants on account of death of deceased Satbir in the accident in question. Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 12 23. Now, it is to be seen as to who is responsible for compensating the claimants. It is argued by learned counsel for the respondent No.3-insurance company, that the respondent No.1 was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident. As such, there is infringement of the terms of policy and the insurance company is not liable for making any payment of compensation to the third party. However, it is pointed out by learned counsel for the claimants as well as the respondents No.1 and 2 that copy of driving licence of respondent No.1 as Ex.P-6/Ex.R-1, copy of registration certificate of the offending vehicle as Ex.P-7/Ex.R-2 and copy of insurance policy as Ex.P-11/Ex.R-3 have been placed on record. Therefore, the insurance company cannot wriggle out of its liability to keep the owner indemnified. 24. After having heard both sides and going through the record, I am of the considered opinion that there is nothing on record to suggest that the driving licence of the respondent no.1 was not proper. It was the duty of the insurance company to prove that the driver was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of the accident. Since insurance company has failed to discharge any such onus, therefore, it is proved that the driver was holding a valid driving licence and there is no infringement of the terms of policy. Therefore, there remains no amount of ambiguity that the respondents No.1 to 3 shall remain jointly and severally liable to compensate the claimants for the amount of compensation assessed above. However, insurance company-respondent No.3 shall make full payment of the award amount of compensation to the claimants, being Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 13 insurer of the offending vehicle i.e. car bearing registration No. HR-55V- 4626. It is ordered accordingly. Both these issues are accordingly decided in favour of claimants and against the respondents. (RELIEF) 25. Consequent upon my findings on aforesaid issues, present petition is accepted partly with costs. The claimants are held entitled to a compensation of Rs.10,71,000/- , on account of death of Satbir in the motor accident in question. The amount of compensation shall be given to claimants in equal shares. 26. In view of the observations made by the Hon’ble Apex Court in ‘New India Assurance Company Limited Versus Charlie and another, 2005(2) The Punjab Law Reporter, 611 ’ the claimants are also allowed interest on the amount of compensation so awarded at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the date of payment, if the amount is deposited within two months of passing of the award, failing which respondents shall be liable to pay interest @ 9% per annum on the amount of compensation till payment. The respondents are directed to deposit the amount of compensation by way of cheques or bank drafts in the name of petitioners, if the bank account numbers and copy of passbooks are supplied by the petitioners to the counsel for the respondent No. 3. If the account numbers are not supplied by the petitioners to the counsel for the respondent No. 3, Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 14 the compensation amount would be deposited in this Tribunal by way of cheques or bank drafts in the name of petitioners. 27. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.1,100/-. Memo of costs be prepared and file be consigned to the record room. Announced in open court. (Dr. Sushil Kumar Garg) Dated : 01.04.2017. Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal Sonipat. UID No.HR0126.

ISSUES NO.2 & 3 14.Both these issues are inter-linked and inter-connected, therefore, the same are being taken up together for disposal. 15. It has been argued on behalf of the claimants that deceased was 40 years of age at the time of accident and was drawing a salary of Rs.12,000/- per month as he was serving as production Supervisor in Supreme Surfactants Pvt.

At the time of death of deceased Satbir age of deceased was mentioned in the petition as 40 years and copy of postmortem examination report/Ex.P-1 also shows his age as 40 years. Thus, it is held that age of deceased was 40 years at the time of accident. Thereafter, as per observations of Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in case Sarla Verma and others Vs Delhi Transport Corporation and another 2009(3) RCR (Civil) 77 , multiplier of 15 should be adopted. 19. Now coming to the dependency, claimant No.1/Daya Nand is father and claimant No.2/Phullo Devi is the mother of the deceased. PW- 1/Daya Nand father of deceased has deposed that he alongwith his wife were fully dependent upon the income of the deceased. Thus, the claimants being dependents of the deceased are held entitled to get compensation for the death of their son in the ill-fated accident. 20. As per deposition of PW-1 deceased Satbir was getting a salary of Rs.12,000/- per month at the time of his death while he was Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 10 working as Supervisor in Supreme Surfactants Pvt. Ltd. HSIDC, Bari, Sonipat. This witness further deposed that his son Satbir was also doing the agricultural work and used to earn Rs.20,000/- per month. Evidence of PW-1 regarding doing job as Supervisor and getting salary of Rs.12,000/-, has been corroborated by PW-3/Sunil Kumar, Accounts Manager, Supreme Surfactants Pvt. Ltd. HSIDC who deposed that deceased Satbir was working as Production Supervisor in their company and he was earning Rs.12,000/- per month and proved the salary slip as Ex.P-4. However, in his cross-examination he deposed that neither he has brought any identity card nor any personal file of deceased Satbir maintained by the company. Further this witness deposed that no TDS was being deducted from the salary of deceased Satbir as no TDS was made out on the salary of deceased. Further petitioners have failed to place on record the appointment letter, identity card and attendance certificate regarding employment of deceased Satbir. Hence, it is clearly made out that no authentic proof has been placed on record by the petitioners regarding the employment of deceased Satbir with the abovesaid company except the salary slip for the month of August, 2015. Therefore, in absence of any authentic proof, income of deceased Satbir will have to be considered as that of a daily wage earner as Rs.8,000/- per month. In view of law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Rajesh and others versus Rajbir Singh and others, 2013(3) R C R (SC) 170 as well as keeping in view the age of deceased, 30% of income is to be added as future prospectus. Therefore, monthly income of the deceased is presumed to be 10,400/-. As per ₹ Sarla Verma's case (supra) a cut Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 11 of 1/2 may be applied as his personal expenses, which the deceased would have spent on himself being bachelor, had he been alive. As such, a sum of Rs.5,200/- will be taken as the amount which he would have spent upon his family. Hence, annual dependency comes to Rs.62,400/- (Rs.5,200 x 12/-). When this amount is multiplied by multiplier of 15, it comes to Rs.9,36,000/- (Rs.62,400/- x 15). 21. Moreover, in case Rajesh and others versus Rajbir Singh and others, (Supra) , the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the Tribunal is to award at least Rs.25,000/- towards funeral expenses. It has been further held that the Tribunals have been quite frugal with regard to award of compensation under the head 'Funeral Expenses'. The 'Price Index', it is a fact has gone up in that regard also. The head 'Funeral Expenses' does not mean the fee paid in the crematorium or fee paid for the use of space in the cemetery. There are many other expenses in connection with funeral and, if the deceased is follower of any particular religion, there are several religious practices and conventions pursuant to death in a family. All those are quite expensive. Thus, in view of the same, the claimant is entitled to Rs.25,000/- on account of last rites; Rs.10,000/- on account of transportation and Rs.1,00,000/- on account of love and affection. 22. Thus, the total amount of compensation is assessed at Rs.9,36,000/- + Rs.1,35,000/- = Rs.10,71,000/-, awarded to the claimants on account of death of deceased Satbir in the accident in question. Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 12 23. Now, it is to be seen as to who is responsible for compensating the claimants. It is argued by learned counsel for the respondent No.3-insurance company, that the respondent No.1 was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident. As such, there is infringement of the terms of policy and the insurance company is not liable for making any payment of compensation to the third party. However, it is pointed out by learned counsel for the claimants as well as the respondents No.1 and 2 that copy of driving licence of respondent No.1 as Ex.P-6/Ex.R-1, copy of registration certificate of the offending vehicle as Ex.P-7/Ex.R-2 and copy of insurance policy as Ex.P-11/Ex.R-3 have been placed on record. Therefore, the insurance company cannot wriggle out of its liability to keep the owner indemnified. 24. After having heard both sides and going through the record, I am of the considered opinion that there is nothing on record to suggest that the driving licence of the respondent no.1 was not proper. It was the duty of the insurance company to prove that the driver was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of the accident. Since insurance company has failed to discharge any such onus, therefore, it is proved that the driver was holding a valid driving licence and there is no infringement of the terms of policy. Therefore, there remains no amount of ambiguity that the respondents No.1 to 3 shall remain jointly and severally liable to compensate the claimants for the amount of compensation assessed above. However, insurance company-respondent No.3 shall make full payment of the award amount of compensation to the claimants, being Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 13 insurer of the offending vehicle i.e. car bearing registration No. HR-55V- 4626. It is ordered accordingly. Both these issues are accordingly decided in favour of claimants and against the respondents. (RELIEF) 25. Consequent upon my findings on aforesaid issues, present petition is accepted partly with costs. The claimants are held entitled to a compensation of Rs.10,71,000/- , on account of death of Satbir in the motor accident in question. The amount of compensation shall be given to claimants in equal shares. 26. In view of the observations made by the Hon’ble Apex Court in ‘New India Assurance Company Limited Versus Charlie and another, 2005(2) The Punjab Law Reporter, 611 ’ the claimants are also allowed interest on the amount of compensation so awarded at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the date of payment, if the amount is deposited within two months of passing of the award, failing which respondents shall be liable to pay interest @ 9% per annum on the amount of compensation till payment. The respondents are directed to deposit the amount of compensation by way of cheques or bank drafts in the name of petitioners, if the bank account numbers and copy of passbooks are supplied by the petitioners to the counsel for the respondent No. 3. If the account numbers are not supplied by the petitioners to the counsel for the respondent No. 3, Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 14 the compensation amount would be deposited in this Tribunal by way of cheques or bank drafts in the name of petitioners. 27. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.1,100/-. Memo of costs be prepared and file be consigned to the record room. Announced in open court. (Dr. Sushil Kumar Garg) Dated : 01.04.2017. Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal Sonipat. UID No.HR0126.

Shri Vijay Gulia, Advocate for respondents No.1 and 2. Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 2 Shri H.C.Jain, Advocate for respondent No.3. AWARD: Present claim petition has been filed by the dependents of deceased, who lost his life in a motor vehicle accident, which took place on 27.08.2015. 2. It is submitted that on 27.08.2015 deceased Satbir along with his brother Balraj were going to their fields for irrigating and at about 9.00 p.m. when Satbir and his brother were moving towards their fields on G.T Road, in the meantime a car bearing registration No.HR-55V-4626 (hereinafter referred to as the offending vehicle) came from the side of Panipat being driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner at a very fast speed and dashed Satbir from the back side. That due to said impact, deceased Satbir sustained grievous injuries on various parts of his body and fell down on the road. That the driver of the offending vehicle after parking the same at a some distance fled away from the spot. That thereafter brother of Satbir after arranging vehicle shifted him to General Hospital, Sonipat where during treatment, Satbir succumbed to his injuries. It has been further pleaded that the accident in question took place due to sole rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 and FIR No.367 dated 28.08.2015 under Sections 279, 304-A IPC was got registered by P.S. Murthal, Sonipat. 3. It is alleged that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by the respondent No.1, which is owned by the respondent No.2 and is insured with the respondent No.3. Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 3 Hence, all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the claimant. 4. It is further submitted that deceased Satbir was 40 years old and was serving as production supervisor in Supreme Surfactants Pvt. Ltd., HSIDC, Bari, Sonipat and was getting a salary of Rs.12,000/- per month at the time of accident. Further deceased Satbir was also doing the agriculture work. 5. Having received notice, respondents No.1 and 2 filed joint written statement stating therein that no such accident was caused with the offending vehicle. It has been further asserted that the income of the deceased has been shown much exaggerated and without any basis. Further asserted that a false FIR has been registered against the respondent No.1. While denying remaining averments, dismissal of petition with costs has been prayed for. 6. Respondent No.3-insurance company filed separate written statement thereby taking certain preliminary objections qua that no such alleged accident took place involving the offending vehicle. Further it has been asserted that there was no rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent No.1/driver and the alleged accident took place due to the fault of deceased Satbir himself, who was walking on the busy road in the night hours without caring for the vehicles running on the road. Further asserted that no intimation as required under Section 134 (c) of the Motor Vehicles Act was given to the Insurance Company by the respondents No.1 and 2. It has been further asserted that respondent No.1 was not having any Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 4 driving licence at the time of accident. On merits, it has been asserted that a false FIR was lodged by the brother of deceased against the respondent No.1. Further asserted that the amount of compensation claimed by the petitioners is highly exaggerated and without any basis. Rests of the assertions are denied and it is prayed for dismissing the claim petition with heavy costs. 7. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed on 07.09.2016 : - 1.Whether the death of Satbir son of Daya Nand is the result of accident which took place on 27.08.2015 due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle i.e. Car bearing No.HR-55V-4626 by respondent No.1? OPP. 2.If issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation, the claimants / petitioners are entitled to and from whom? OPP. 3.Whether respondent No.1 was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident and the offending vehicle had violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect? OPR- 3. 4.Relief. 8. In order to prove their case, claimant No.1 Daya Nand himself appeared into the witness box as PW-1 and examined Balraj author of FIR and eye witness of the occurrence as PW-2, Sunil Kumar, Accounts Manager as PW-3, besides relying upon documentary evidence. 9. On the other hand, the respondents have not led any oral evidence and placed reliance upon some documentary evidence. Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 5 10. I have appraised the evidence on record, the material circumstances of the case and the arguments addressed by learned counsel for the parties. My findings on the aforesaid issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1 11. In support of this issue, claimant, namely, Daya Nand (father of deceased) himself appeared into the witness box as PW-1 and reiterated his stand taken in the petition by tendering his duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW-1/A. He has duly given the manner in which the accident took place while deposing completely on the lines of the petition. Further petitioners examined PW-2/Balraj who is author of FIR as well as eye witness to the accident in question. PW-2/Balraj tendered into evidence his duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW-2/A thereby deposing about the manner of accident and also corroborated the facts mentioned in the claim petition. Further petitioners have placed on record copy of post mortem report as Ex.P-1, copy of FIR as Ex.P-2, authorization letter of PW-3 as Ex.P-3, salary slip of deceased as Ex.P-4, certified copy of report under section 173 Cr.P.C. as Ex.P-5, certified copy of driving licence of respondent Hemant Kumar as PW-6, certified copy of registration certificate of the offending vehicle as Ex.P-7, copy of contract carriage permit as Ex.P-8, copies of token tax (road tax) as Ex.P-9 and Ex.P-10, copies of insurance policy as Ex.P-11 and Ex.P-12. 12. To rebut the claim of the petitioners qua negligence of respondent No.1 in causing the accident in question, respondents have failed to lead any evidence. Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 6 13. It is settled law that it is the entire responsibility of the claimants to establish that the driver of the offending vehicle was driving the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner, which resulted into the accident. Further, with regard to standard of proof, it has been held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Parmeshwari Devi vs. Amir Chand and others, 2011(2) RCR (Civil)153, that in a claim pertaining to a road accident, the strict principles of proof in a criminal case are not attracted and that the claimants are merely to establish their case on the touch-stone of preponderance of probabilities. With the above discussed law and evidence on record, this Tribunal is satisfied that the claimants have succeeded in establishing that on 27.08.2015 the offending vehicle was being driven by respondent No.1 in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident in question. PW-2/Balraj duly d eposed about the manner of accident, which finds corroboration vide Ex.P-2 copy of FIR. The deposition of PW-2 qua negligence of the driver of the offending vehicle remained unrebutted. PW-2 has consistently deposed that respondent No.1 had caused the accident in question & was caused on account of his rash and negligent driving and respondents have failed to impeach the testimony of PW-2. Moreover, had the accident not been caused by negligent driving of respondent No.1, then there would have been no reason on the part of PW-2 to lodge the FIR and to appear as a witness against him. Further, from the perusal of Ex.P-1 it transpires that registration number of the offending vehicle has been specifically mentioned in the FIR and it is further alleged that the accident in question has been caused due to rash and negligent driving of its driver. Though Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 7 respondent No.1 has taken specific plea in the reply that accident was not caused by him and the offending vehicle has been falsely implicated in the present case, however respondent No.1 has failed to fortify his assertion and failed to rebut the testimony of the claimants. H ad the accident not taken place as alleged by the petitioners, respondent No.1 would certainly have made complaints to the higher authorities regarding false implication of the offending vehicle with regard to the accident, but no such event happened. Therefore, the evidence coming on record proves rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 in causing the accident in question. This Tribunal does not see any reason to disbelieve the evidence produced by the petitioners. In such circumstances, it is held that petitioners have proved that the accident in question had been caused due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No.1, on the touch stone of preponderance of probabilities. This issue is accordingly decided in favour of petitioners and against the respondents. ISSUES NO.2 & 3 14.Both these issues are inter-linked and inter-connected, therefore, the same are being taken up together for disposal. 15. It has been argued on behalf of the claimants that deceased was 40 years of age at the time of accident and was drawing a salary of Rs.12,000/- per month as he was serving as production Supervisor in Supreme Surfactants Pvt. Ltd., HSIDC, Bari, Sonipat. Further argued that deceased was also doing agricultural work and used to earn Rs.20,000/- per month. Learned counsel for the claimants also referred to the Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 8 statements of PW-1/Daya Nand (father of deceased), who has categorically deposed that petitioners were fully dependent upon the income of the deceased and now they have no source of income. It is therefore, prayed for allowing just compensation, so that the loss of income may be fairly compensated to the dependents of deceased. 16.On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents have prayed for only assessing just compensation to the claimants. It is argued that the income of deceased Satbir as Rs.32,000/- per month claimed by the claimants is exaggerated, whereas no authentic proof has been placed on record to prove his aforesaid income. Therefore, it is argued that at best, the monthly income of deceased Satbir can be taken as that of a daily wage earner and multiplier be adopted accordingly. 17. After having heard learned counsel on behalf of all the parties and perusing the record carefully, it may be observed that proceedings before Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal are of summary nature and strict provisions of Indian Evidence Act are not applicable to it and the probative value of the documents may not be suspected without any reasonable cause. Reference, in this regard may be made to National Insurance Co. Vs Saloni Dargan and others 1990 ACJ 127. The assessment of compensation involves guess work, hypothesis, consideration and sympathy of the tribunal as has been held in R.D.Hattangadi Vs Pest Control (India) Pvt.Ltd.1995 ACJ 366(SC). The compensation can be granted in the following heads: 1)Pecuniary loss: Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 9 a)medical expenses; b)Loss of earning and c)other material loss. 2)Non pecuniary loss: a)damage for pain and suffering; b)damages for loss of amenities of life c)damages for loss of expectation of life d)Inconvenience, hardship, discomfort, disappointment, frustration and mental stress in life. 18. At the time of death of deceased Satbir age of deceased was mentioned in the petition as 40 years and copy of postmortem examination report/Ex.P-1 also shows his age as 40 years. Thus, it is held that age of deceased was 40 years at the time of accident. Thereafter, as per observations of Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in case Sarla Verma and others Vs Delhi Transport Corporation and another 2009(3) RCR (Civil) 77 , multiplier of 15 should be adopted. 19. Now coming to the dependency, claimant No.1/Daya Nand is father and claimant No.2/Phullo Devi is the mother of the deceased. PW- 1/Daya Nand father of deceased has deposed that he alongwith his wife were fully dependent upon the income of the deceased. Thus, the claimants being dependents of the deceased are held entitled to get compensation for the death of their son in the ill-fated accident. 20. As per deposition of PW-1 deceased Satbir was getting a salary of Rs.12,000/- per month at the time of his death while he was Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 10 working as Supervisor in Supreme Surfactants Pvt. Ltd. HSIDC, Bari, Sonipat. This witness further deposed that his son Satbir was also doing the agricultural work and used to earn Rs.20,000/- per month. Evidence of PW-1 regarding doing job as Supervisor and getting salary of Rs.12,000/-, has been corroborated by PW-3/Sunil Kumar, Accounts Manager, Supreme Surfactants Pvt. Ltd. HSIDC who deposed that deceased Satbir was working as Production Supervisor in their company and he was earning Rs.12,000/- per month and proved the salary slip as Ex.P-4. However, in his cross-examination he deposed that neither he has brought any identity card nor any personal file of deceased Satbir maintained by the company. Further this witness deposed that no TDS was being deducted from the salary of deceased Satbir as no TDS was made out on the salary of deceased. Further petitioners have failed to place on record the appointment letter, identity card and attendance certificate regarding employment of deceased Satbir. Hence, it is clearly made out that no authentic proof has been placed on record by the petitioners regarding the employment of deceased Satbir with the abovesaid company except the salary slip for the month of August, 2015. Therefore, in absence of any authentic proof, income of deceased Satbir will have to be considered as that of a daily wage earner as Rs.8,000/- per month. In view of law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Rajesh and others versus Rajbir Singh and others, 2013(3) R C R (SC) 170 as well as keeping in view the age of deceased, 30% of income is to be added as future prospectus. Therefore, monthly income of the deceased is presumed to be 10,400/-. As per ₹ Sarla Verma's case (supra) a cut Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 11 of 1/2 may be applied as his personal expenses, which the deceased would have spent on himself being bachelor, had he been alive. As such, a sum of Rs.5,200/- will be taken as the amount which he would have spent upon his family. Hence, annual dependency comes to Rs.62,400/- (Rs.5,200 x 12/-). When this amount is multiplied by multiplier of 15, it comes to Rs.9,36,000/- (Rs.62,400/- x 15). 21. Moreover, in case Rajesh and others versus Rajbir Singh and others, (Supra) , the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that the Tribunal is to award at least Rs.25,000/- towards funeral expenses. It has been further held that the Tribunals have been quite frugal with regard to award of compensation under the head 'Funeral Expenses'. The 'Price Index', it is a fact has gone up in that regard also. The head 'Funeral Expenses' does not mean the fee paid in the crematorium or fee paid for the use of space in the cemetery. There are many other expenses in connection with funeral and, if the deceased is follower of any particular religion, there are several religious practices and conventions pursuant to death in a family. All those are quite expensive. Thus, in view of the same, the claimant is entitled to Rs.25,000/- on account of last rites; Rs.10,000/- on account of transportation and Rs.1,00,000/- on account of love and affection. 22. Thus, the total amount of compensation is assessed at Rs.9,36,000/- + Rs.1,35,000/- = Rs.10,71,000/-, awarded to the claimants on account of death of deceased Satbir in the accident in question. Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 12 23. Now, it is to be seen as to who is responsible for compensating the claimants. It is argued by learned counsel for the respondent No.3-insurance company, that the respondent No.1 was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident. As such, there is infringement of the terms of policy and the insurance company is not liable for making any payment of compensation to the third party. However, it is pointed out by learned counsel for the claimants as well as the respondents No.1 and 2 that copy of driving licence of respondent No.1 as Ex.P-6/Ex.R-1, copy of registration certificate of the offending vehicle as Ex.P-7/Ex.R-2 and copy of insurance policy as Ex.P-11/Ex.R-3 have been placed on record. Therefore, the insurance company cannot wriggle out of its liability to keep the owner indemnified. 24. After having heard both sides and going through the record, I am of the considered opinion that there is nothing on record to suggest that the driving licence of the respondent no.1 was not proper. It was the duty of the insurance company to prove that the driver was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of the accident. Since insurance company has failed to discharge any such onus, therefore, it is proved that the driver was holding a valid driving licence and there is no infringement of the terms of policy. Therefore, there remains no amount of ambiguity that the respondents No.1 to 3 shall remain jointly and severally liable to compensate the claimants for the amount of compensation assessed above. However, insurance company-respondent No.3 shall make full payment of the award amount of compensation to the claimants, being Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 13 insurer of the offending vehicle i.e. car bearing registration No. HR-55V- 4626. It is ordered accordingly. Both these issues are accordingly decided in favour of claimants and against the respondents. (RELIEF) 25. Consequent upon my findings on aforesaid issues, present petition is accepted partly with costs. The claimants are held entitled to a compensation of Rs.10,71,000/- , on account of death of Satbir in the motor accident in question. The amount of compensation shall be given to claimants in equal shares. 26. In view of the observations made by the Hon’ble Apex Court in ‘New India Assurance Company Limited Versus Charlie and another, 2005(2) The Punjab Law Reporter, 611 ’ the claimants are also allowed interest on the amount of compensation so awarded at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the date of payment, if the amount is deposited within two months of passing of the award, failing which respondents shall be liable to pay interest @ 9% per annum on the amount of compensation till payment. The respondents are directed to deposit the amount of compensation by way of cheques or bank drafts in the name of petitioners, if the bank account numbers and copy of passbooks are supplied by the petitioners to the counsel for the respondent No. 3. If the account numbers are not supplied by the petitioners to the counsel for the respondent No. 3, Daya Nand and another Vs. Hemant Kumar and others 14 the compensation amount would be deposited in this Tribunal by way of cheques or bank drafts in the name of petitioners. 27. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.1,100/-.

My issue-wise findings on various issues are as under – ISSUE NO. 1 14.For proving this issue, the claimants/petitioners have relied upon the statement of Ramesh Chander PW2 besides placing reliance upon copy of FIR Ex. P1, copy of PMR Ex. P2, certified copy of challan Ex. P3. 15.The first information report no. 246 dated 29.07.2014 under sections 279,304-A IPC was lodged with the Police Station, Murthal, Sonipat pertaining to this accident and the same is on record as Ex. P1. It was lodged on the statement of Ramesh Chand Rana (PW2) and it contains the registration number of the offending vehicle i.e. DL3C-BE-1812 and the driver of the offending vehicle as Sunny Dayal son of Mahabir Singh, caste Chaman, resident of House no. 34/29, Ram Nagar, Rohtak Road, Jind. It has been mentioned in FIR Ex. P1 by its author Ramesh Chander Rana that he works as Manager MACT Case No. 01 of 2015 Rajeshwari Devi etc. Vs. Sunny Dayal etc. 12 in Lajuna Rasoi. On 29.07.2014, a waiter of their hotel namely Mahender Singh Rana son of Shekhar Singh Rana, Caste Rana, resident of Polena, District Pori Garhwal, aged about 32 years was coming to Hotel on his duty. When he reached near hotel, then at about 04.30 p.m, a car of silver colour came from the side of Delhi whose driver was driving it with a very fast speed and struck against Mahender Singh Rana. Mahender Singh Rana fell down on G.T. Road and driver of the car stopped his car at some distance. The registration number of the car was DL3C-BE-1812 of the make Honda City of Silver Colour. The driver told his name as Sunny Dayal son of Mahabir Singh, caste Chamar, resident of 34/29, Ram Nagar, Rohtak Road, Jind. Mahender Singh Rana expired on the spot. Ramesh Chand Rana (PW2) was looking after the deceased and in the mean time, the driver fled away from the spot leaving his car on the spot. The accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the above said vehicle due to which, Mahender Singh Rana succumbed to his injuries on the spot. Ramesh Chand Rana telephonically informed police control room. MACT Case No. 01 of 2015 Rajeshwari Devi etc. Vs. Sunny Dayal etc. 13 16.Ramesh Chander while appearing as PW2 has reiterated the facts mentioned in the FIR Ex. P1 on oath in his affidavit Ex. PW2/A given by him in his examination-in-chief. He has categorically stated that the accident took place on 29.07.2014 at about 04.30 p.m, in the area of Police Station, Murthal due to the rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent no. 1 while driving the offending vehicle i.e. car bearing registration no. DL3C-BE-1812, due to which Mahender Singh Rana expired at the spot. Nothing has come in the cross-examination of Ramesh Chander (PW2), from which, it could be said that the accident had not taken place in the manner as alleged and deposed by him. 17.As against this cogent oral as well as documentary evidence regarding the manner of the accident, no evidence whatsoever has been led by the respondents. Neither the respondent no. 1 has stepped into the witness box to rebut the allegations and the evidence led by the claimants/ petitioners regarding the manner of accident nor the respondent no. 3 has led any evidence in this regard. 18.Certified copy of challan Ex. P3 shows that the respondent MACT Case No. 01 of 2015 Rajeshwari Devi etc. Vs. Sunny Dayal etc. 14 no. 1 has been facing trial pertaining to FIR Ex. P1. It has been held by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Shyam and others 1993(2) Punjab Law Reporter 109 that “where a person was facing trial for causing the accident, it is to be presumed that the accident has taken place due to rash and negligent driving of the driver”. Similar view has been taken by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Gurdeep Kaur Vs. Tarsem Singh 2008(2) RCR(Civil) 774 at page 775(H). 19. Therefore, no other view is possible except to hold that the accident had taken place on 29.07.2014 at about 04.30 p.m. near Laguna Rasoi Hotel, G.T. Road due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 1 while driving the offending vehicle i.e. car bearing registration no. DL3C-BE-1812, due to which Mahender Singh Rana expired at the spot. The death of deceased Mahender Singh Rana is not only proved from the statement of Ramesh Chander PW2, but also from the copy of post mortem report Ex. P2. Therefore, this issue is accordingly decided in favour of the claimants/petitioners and against the respondents. MACT Case No. 01 of 2015 Rajeshwari Devi etc. Vs. Sunny Dayal etc. 15 ISSUE NO. 2 20.It has been pleaded by the claimants/petitioners in claim petition that the deceased Mahender Singh Rana was working as a waiter at Laguna Rasoi Hotel and he was earning Rs. 15,000/- per month. Claimants / petitioners have examined claimant / petitioner no. 1 Rajeshwari Devi as PW1 to prove that the deceased was earning Rs. 15,000/- per month while working as Waiter at Laguna Rasoi Hotel. But there is no documentary proof to prove that the deceased was earning Rs. 15,000/- per month while working as Waiter at Laguna Rasoi Hotel. Therefore, the monthly income of the deceased cannot be taken more than Rs. 8100/- as per minimum wages for the year 2014- 2015 i.e. from 01.03.2014 to 28.02.2015. 21.As there are 6 dependents of the deceased, 1/4th is deducted towards personal expenses of the deceased as per law laid down in Smt. Sarla Verma and others Vs Delhi Transport Corporation and others 2009 (3) RCR(Civil) 77 and therefore, the monthly dependency comes to Rs 6075/-. As per copy of PMR Ex. P2, the deceased was of the age of 32 years at the time of the MACT Case No. 01 of 2015 Rajeshwari Devi etc. Vs. Sunny Dayal etc. 16 accident and therefore, 50% of Rs 6075/- is to be added as future prospects as has been laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Santosh Devi Vs National Insurance Co. Ltd. and others 2012(2) RCR(Civil) 882, Rajesh and others Vs. Rajbir Singh and others 2013(3) RCR(Civil) 170 and Sanobanu Nazirbhai Mirza and others Vs Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service 2013(4) RCR(Civil) 732. Therefore, the monthly income of the deceased comes to Rs 9112/-. The annual dependency comes to Rs 1,09,344/-. According to PMR Ex. P2, the deceased was of the age of 32 years at the time of accident Therefore, the multiplier of ‘16’ should be applied as laid down in Smt. Sarla Verma and others Vs Delhi Transport Corporation and others (supra). This takes the compensation amount to Rs 17,49,504/-. (Rs Seventeen Lacs Forty Nine Thousand Five Hundred Four Only). An amount of Rs 1,00,000/- (Rs one lac) is awarded towards loss of consortium, an amount Rs 1,00,000/- (Rs one lac) is awarded towards loss of care and guidance for minor children, an amount of Rs 25,000/- (Rs twenty five thousand) is awarded towards MACT Case No. 01 of 2015 Rajeshwari Devi etc. Vs. Sunny Dayal etc. 17 funeral expenses, an amount of Rs 25,000/- (Rs twenty five thousand) is awarded towards pain, loss and sufferings and an amount of Rs 3000/- is awarded towards transportation expenses as per the law laid down in Sanobanu’s case (supra) . This takes the compensation amount to Rs 20,02,504/- (Twenty Lacs Two Thousand Five Hundred Four only). 22.Learned counsel for the respondent no. 3 argued that the insurance company is not liable to pay the compensation amount because the present insurance policy Ex. R7 was issued on the basis of previous insurance policy Ex. R6/Ex. R9, which was fake and this fact is proved from the statement of Jaiwant Vincent Masih, Branch Manager, Shri Ram General Insurance Company, Lajpat nagar, Delhi as RW2 and from the statement of Prerna Jain, Senior Executive Legal, Future Generali India Insurance Company Limited, New Delhi as RW1. 23.Learned counsel for the respondent no. 3 has relied upon the law laid down in United India Insurance Company Limited Vs. Ranjit Singh and another, Vol. CLXX-(2013-2), 478 MACT Case No. 01 of 2015 Rajeshwari Devi etc. Vs. Sunny Dayal etc. 18 and Oriental Insurance Company Limited Vs. Rakesh Kumar and others, 2012 ACJ 1268. I have no dispute regarding the laws laid down in the above said cases. But, the same are not applicable to the facts of the present case because in the present case, Prerna Jain, (RW1) Sr. Executive Legal of the respondent no. 3 has admitted in her cross-examination that the period of insurance of the previous policy of respondent no. 2 was from 28.07.2013 to 27.07.2014 and that the sale elapsed on 27.07.2014 at midnight and that there was a gap of one day between the previous policy and new policy issued by them. She has further stated in her cross-examination that the policy issued by their company was a genuine policy and was issued after taking insurance premium and she has again admitted in her cross-examination that on the date of the accident i.e. 29.07.2014, the insurance policy issued by their company was in force. Jaiwant Vincent Masih, Branch Manager of Shri Ram General Insurance Company Limited has stated in his cross-examination that no claim has been filed with them on the basis of Ex. R6/ Ex. R9. Therefore, even if the previous insurance policy Ex. R6/Ex. R9 was fake, even then, the MACT Case No. 01 of 2015 Rajeshwari Devi etc. Vs. Sunny Dayal etc. 19 respondent no. 3 is liable to compensate the claimants / petitioners being insurer of the offending vehicle vide insurance policy Ex. R7, which is genuine. The respondent no. 1 is the driver, the respondent no. 2 is the owner and the respondent no. 3 is the insurer of the alleged offending vehicle and as such, all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation amount to the claimants/petitioners. The respondent no. 3, being the insurer, has the first liability to pay the compensation amount to the claimants/petitioners. This issue is accordingly decided in favour of the claimants/petitioners and against the respondents. ISSUE NO. 3 24.The driving licence Ex. R1 of the respondent no. 1 is on record, which is valid up from 02.01.2008 to 01.01.2028. It means that the driving licence Ex. R1 of respondent no. 1 was a valid and effective driving licence on the date of accident that is 23.07.2014. Otherwise also, no evidence has been led by the respondent no. 3 to show that the driving licence Ex. R1 was not a valid and effective driving licence on the date of accident. Therefore, this issue is decided against the MACT Case No. 01 of 2015 Rajeshwari Devi etc. Vs. Sunny Dayal etc. 20 respondent no. 3. ISSUE NO. 4 (RELIEF) 25.The claim petition succeeds. 26.An award of compensation to the tune of Rs 20,02,504/- (Twenty Lacs Two Thousand Five Hundred Four only) along with 7.5% per annum interest on the award amount from the date of filing of the claim petition till the date of actual realization with costs is passed in favour of the petitioners/claimants to be paid by the respondent no. 3.

Onus to prove this issue was upon the claimant. Under this issue, the claimant was required to prove that on 11.3.2012, an accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle i.e. car bearing No.HR-06U/9000 by its driver respondent No.1 and caused injuries to the claimant. Claimant himself appeared in the witness box as PW2 and tendered his duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW2/A in evidence reiterating the averments of the petition. However, the same are not reproduced here for the sake of brevity. Virender son of Jai Narain appeared in the witness box as PW1 and tendered his duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW1/A in evidence and deposed that on 11.3.2012, Sandeep and his cousin Anil were going to village Chirasmi from G.T. Road. Sandeep was driving the motorcycle bearing No.HR-42A/6669 and Anil was pillion rider and when they reached near the gate of DITM College, Chirasmi, then, suddenly offending vehicle HR-06U/9000 being driven by respondent No.1 in rash and negligent manner and without obeying traffic rules and hit back-side of the motorcycle occupied by said Sandeep and Anil. They fell down on the road with their motorcycle and received serious and multiple injuries on their person. Respondent No.1 stopped his vehicle and then, ran away from the spot. Sandeep and Anil were taken to hospital by him. The accident was caused due to rash and negligent and high speed driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1. 10.Learned counsel appearing for the claimant has argued that it has been proved that on 11.3.2012, the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1 due to which claimant received injuries. FIR was lodged against the respondent No.1 which support the case of the claimant. 11.On the other hand, learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No.3 has argued that claimant has filed the present petition in collusion with respondents No.1&2. PW1 Virender Singh is a procured witness. No such accident took place. Claimant has filed a false claim petition in order to claim compensation from the insurance company. He has further argued that claimant produced no evidence to prove that he sustained injuries in the alleged accident and got treatment from any hospital. So, the claim petition may kindly be dismissed. 12.I have given my thoughtful consideration to the rival submissions advanced by learned counsel for the parties. 13.It is apparent that claimant Sandeep, when appeared in the witness box as PW2, has categorically deposed that on 11.3.2012, he and his cousin namely Anil were going to village Chirasmi from G.T. Road on motorcycle bearing registration No.HR-42A/6669 which was being driven by him and Anil was pillion rider. When they reached near the gate of DITM College, Chirasmi, then, suddenly the offending vehicle bearing No.HR-06U/9000 being driven by respondent No.1 in a rash and negligent manner hit the backside of the motorcycle, due to which, they fell down on the road alongwith their motorcycle and received serious and multiple injuries. The claimant has also produced the final report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex.P1, site plan Ex.P2 of the place of occurrence and First Information Report Ex.P4. Ex.P4 FIR was lodged on the basis of statement of Virender Singh PW1 against respondent No.1 in Police Station, Gannaur. Virender Singh appeared in the witness box as PW1 and it was deposed vide affidavit Ex.PW1/A that on 11.3.2012, Sandeep and his cousin namely Anil were going to village Chirasmi. He witnessed the accident which took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle bearing No.HR-06U/9000 by respondent No.1. PW1 Virender Singh has further deposed that claimant Sandeep and pillion rider Anil sustained injuries in this accident and he took them to the hospital. 14.Further, claimant as well as PW1 Virender Singh are subjected to lengthy cross-examination, but nothing came out which may belied their version. FIR Ex.P4 resulted into prosecution of respondent No.1 Mani Ram and vide report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex.P1, a prosecution was launched against respondent No.1. These facts are themselves sufficient corroboration to the testimony of PW1 Virender Singh and claimant Sandeep. Further, the testimony of PW1 Virender Singh and claimant Sandeep has gone unrebutted, as respondent No.1 Mani Ram did not dare to step into witness box to substantiate his plea taken in the written statement that no such accident had ever taken place and he has been falsely implicated in the present case. Moreover, had respondent No.1 Mani Ram been falsely implicated in the criminal case, then, he would have filed a complaint to the higher authorities regarding his false involvement, but no such allegation is shown to have been filed. 15.In view of above discussions and reasons, this Tribunal reached at the conclusion that said accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle bearing No.HR-06U/9000 by respondent No.1 Mani Ram. 16.Now coming to the next question as to whether claimant received injuries in the said accident? The answer is in negative, because, claimant has not produced any evidence to prove that he sustained injuries in the said accident. Claimant has not produced MLR. There is no iota of evidence to show that claimant received any injury in accident in question. Accordingly, this issue is decided partly in favour of the claimant and partly in favour of the respondents. ISSUE NO.2 : 17.Onus to prove this issue was upon the claimant. The petitioner has claimed compensation of Rs.15,00,000/- on account of injuries sustained by him in said accident. In case of compensation on account of injuries, the Tribunal has to see the nature of injuries, duration of treatment, expenses spent on treatment, pain and suffering, mental agony, special diet and loss of income of injured. In this case, the petitioner failed to prove that he sustained injuries in said accident. He produced no evidence to prove injuries. There is no iota of evidence to show that petitioner incurred any expenses. So, this Tribunal has no hesitation in holding that the petitioner is not entitled to compensation and accordingly, this issue is decided against the petitioner and in favour of the respondents. ISSUE NO.3 : 18.Onus to prove this issue was upon the respondent No.3. No evidence is led by respondent No.3 to prove that offending vehicle was being driven by respondent No.1 in contravention of the terms and conditions of insurance policy. Copy of driving licence Ex.R2/Ex.P6 was produced, from which, it stands proved on record that Ex.R2/Ex.P6 was issued by Licencing Authority, Assandh and is valied w.e.f. 20.3.2006 to 19.3.2026 and the accident in question took place on 11.3.2012. Thus, this issue is decided against respondent No.3. RELIEF :- 19.In view of the findings of this Tribunal returned on issues under adjudication, present claim petition fails and the same is hereby dismissed. No order as to costs. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly. File be consigned to records after due compliance.

(Insurer of car bearing registration No.HR-06U-9000). …Respondents Claim petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 Argued by: Shri Yudhvir Singh, Advocate for the petitioner Shri Jagbir Attri, Advocate for respondent Nos.1 & 2 Shri Ajay Garg, Advocate for respondent No.3 2 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. AWARD : Present claim petition has been filed by the petitioner on account of the injuries suffered by him in a Motor Vehicular Accident taken place on 11.03.2012 near D.I.T.M. College, village Chirasmi, P.S. Gannaur, due to rash and negligent driving of car bearing registration No.HR-06U/9000 (hereinafter be referred to as offending vehicle) by the respondent No.1. 2.Brief facts of the claim petition are that on 11.03.2012, the petitioner along with his cousin Sandeep was going to village Chirasmi from G.T. Road on motorcycle bearing No.HR-42A/6669 driving by Sandeep and he was pillion rider. When the petitioner alongwith Sandeep reached near the gate of D.I.T.M. College, Chirasmi, the respondent No.1 came while driving the offending vehicle at a very high speed, rashly and negligently and without following traffic rules from the side of G.T. Road and directly hit the back side of his motorcycle, as a result of which, the petitioner and Sandeep fell on the road. The respondent No.1 stopped with his vehicle for a while at the spot and thereafter, fled away from the spot. The petitioner and Sandeep were taken to hospital by Virender son of Jai Narayan who 3 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. was on his motorcycle behind the petitioner. Said accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1. In this accident, the petitioner sustained injuries/fractures in his right leg, thigh and right knee and also sustained other injuries. After conducting MLR at CHC, Gannaur, he was referred to Patil Hospital, Sonepat where X-ray was done by the doctor and remained hospitalised there for 3 days. Thereafter, he was referred to Shiva Hospital, Sonepat where he was operated twice and remained hospitalised there for 12 days. He was advised complete bed rest for six months. He incurred Rs.5 lacs on his treatment. At the time of accident, he was earning Rs.10,000/- per month. He suffered a great mental agony and huge financial loss due to this accident. On the basis of statement of complainant Virender, an FIR No.95 dated 12.03.2012, under Sections 279/337 of the Indian Penal Code was registered with Police Station, Gannaur, against respondent No.1. The petitioner on account of injuries sustained in accident, has claimed compensation to the tune of Rs.15.00 lacs with interest @ 12% per annum from the date of filing of petition till its realisation. 3.Upon notice, respondent Nos.1 and 2, in their joint written 4 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. statement, have resisted the present claim petition on the grounds that no such accident has ever been taken place with the offending vehicle on the alleged date, time and place and a false FIR has been lodged against the respondent No.1. The respondent No.1 is having a valid driving licence and respondent No.2 is having valid registration certificate and offending vehicle is insured with respondent No.3. They have alleged the amount of compensation to be excessive and exorbitant and also prayed for the dismissal of the petition. 4.The respondent No.3 i.e. insurance company in its separately filed written statement, has resisted the claim petition on the grounds that on the day of accident, respondent No.1 did not possess a legal and valid driving license to drive the car in question nor any intimation regarding said accident was ever given to it as required under Section 134(C) of the M.V . Act. The answering respondent has taken all the defences under Sections 147, 149 and 157 of M.V . Act. On merits, it has denied the factum of accident as stated in the petition and averred that in fact, no alleged accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of car in question by respondent No.1 and a false case has been got registered against 5 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. respondent No.1 in order to extract fake compensation from it. It is denied by the answering respondent that the petitioner was earning Rs.15,000/- per month or that he incurred Rs.5 lacs on his treatment. Besides praying for dismissal of claim petition, the insurance company has alleged the amount of compensation to be excessive and exorbitant. 5.No rejoinder was filed and on the pleadings of parties, the following issues were settled for adjudication on 06.02.2015 - 1.Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle bearing registration No.HR-06U-9000, by its driver-respondent No.1 on 11.3.2012, owned by respondent No.2, causing injuries to Anil as alleged? OPP. 2.If issue No.1 is decided in favour of petitioner/petitioner, whether the petitioner/petitioner is entitled to claim amount as claimed in the claim petition and from whom? OPP 3.Whether the respondent No.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence on the date and at the time of alleged accident or that violated the terms and conditions of insurance policy, if so its effect? OPR-3 4.Relief. 6.In order to prove his case, petitioner examined complainant Virender Singh as PW1, Sumit as PW2 and Dr. Atul Patil 6 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. as PW3. The petitioner has relied upon documents Ex.P1 to Ex.P23. 7.On the other hand, respondents did not examine any witness. Counsel for respondents No.1&2 tendered into evidence documents Ex.R2 to Ex.R4 and closed the evidence on behalf of respondents No.1&2 vide his separately recorded statement. Counsel for respondents No.3 tendered into evidence document Ex.R1 and closed the evidence on behalf of respondent No.3 vide his separately recorded statement. 8.I have heard the arguments on behalf of both sides and going through the case file, my issue-wise findings are as under - ISSUE No.1 9. Onus to prove this issue was upon the petitioner. Under this issue, the petitioner was required to prove that on 11.3.2012, an accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle i.e. car bearing No.HR-06U/9000 by its driver respondent No.1 and caused injuries to the petitioner. In order to discharge his onus, petitioner examined three witnesses. PW1 is Virender. He tendered his duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW1/A in evidence and deposed that on 11.3.2012, Sandeep and 7 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. his cousin Anil were going to village Chirasmi from G.T. Road. Sandeep was driving the motorcycle bearing No.HR-42A/6669 and Anil was pillion rider and when they reached near the gate of DITM College, Chirasmi, then, suddenly offending vehicle HR-06U/9000 being driven by respondent No.1 in rash and negligent manner and without obeying traffic rules and hit back-side of the motorcycle occupied by said Sandeep and Anil. They fell down on the road with their motorcycle and received serious and multiple injuries on their person. Respondent No.1 stopped his vehicle and then, ran away from the spot. Sandeep and Anil were taken to hospital by him. The accident was caused due to rash and negligent and high speed driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1. PW2 is Sumit. He is General Power of Attorney holder of petitioner. He tendered his duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW2/A in evidence and reiterated the averments of the petition which is not being discussed as summarized version of the petitioner has already been discussed. PW3 is Dr. Atul Patil from Shiva Hospital, Dev Nagar, Sonepat. He deposed that on 13.03.2012 at 10.30 A.M., he admitted 8 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. patient Anil son of Joginder, 18 years old male, resident of Chirasmi, Ganaur, with fracture femur right and fracture tibia right with alleged history of road side accident. MLR was done at Gannaur, for which surgery was done. Interlock nailing of femur was done under spinal anesthesia. He was discharged in satisfactory condition on 23.03.2012. On 24.10.2014, he admitted patient Anil son of Dil Singh, resident of Jaisingpur, Karnal with the diagnosis old operated fractured femur right side and surgery was done and nail was removed and he was discharged on 26.10.2014. Bills Ex.P2 to Ex.P17 are issued by their hospital. 10.Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has argued that it has been proved that on 11.3.2012, the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1 due to which petitioner received injuries. FIR was lodged against the respondent No.1 which support the case of the petitioner. 11.On the other hand, learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No.3 has argued that petitioner has filed the present petition in collusion with respondents No.1&2. PW1 Virender Singh is a procured witness. No such accident took place. petitioner has filed a 9 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. false claim petition in order to claim compensation from the insurance company. He has further argued that petitioner did not appear in the witness box to prove his case. PW2 Sumit Power of Attorney Holder of petitioner appeared in the witness box but he cannot depose on behalf of petitioner. He was not present at the spot at the time of alleged accident, therefore, he has no personal knowledge about the alleged accident. It was petitioner who could prove his case and he could have been cross-examined on the question of alleged injuries sustained in the alleged accident. So, the claim petition may kindly be dismissed. 12.I have given my thoughtful consideration to the rival submissions advanced by learned counsel for the parties. 13.It is true that petitioner Anil himself did not appear in the witness box to prove his case but there is sufficient evidence on case file to prove the accident in question and it has been proved by oral as well as documentary evidence that the alleged accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle bearing No.HR- 06U/9000 by respondent No.1. The petitioner has also produced the final report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex.P1, site plan Ex.P2 of the 10 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. place of occurrence and First Information Report Ex.P4. 14.It is apparent that Virender Singh appeared in the witness box as PW1 and it was claimed in his affidavit Ex.PW1/A tendered by him in his evidence that on 11.3.2012, Sandeep and his cousin namely Anil were going to village Chirasmi. He witnessed the accident which took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle bearing No.HR-06U/9000 by respondent No.1. PW1 Virender Singh has further deposed that petitioner Sandeep and pillion rider Anil sustained injuries in this accident and he took them to the hospital. Ex.P4 FIR was lodged on the basis of statement of Virender Singh PW1 against respondent No.1 in Police Station, Gannaur. 15.Further, PW1 Virender Singh is subjected to lengthy cross-examination, but nothing came out which may belied his version. FIR Ex.P4 resulted into prosecution of respondent No.1 Mani Ram and vide report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex.P1, a prosecution was launched against respondent No.1. These facts are themselves sufficient corroboration to the testimony of PW1 Virender Singh. Further, the testimony of PW1 Virender Singh has gone unrebutted, as respondent No.1 Mani Ram did not dare to step into witness box to 11 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. substantiate his plea taken in the written statement that no such accident had ever taken place and he has been falsely implicated in the present case. Moreover, had respondent No.1 Mani Ram been falsely implicated in the criminal case, then, he would have filed a complaint to the higher authorities regarding his false involvement, but no such allegation is shown to have been filed. 16.Further it is apparent that FIR against respondent No.1 was registered under Sections 279, 337 and 338 IPC. MLR of petitioner Anil is also on case file. Although, the MLR is not proved but can be taken into consideration. In view of above discussions and reasonings, this Tribunal reached at the conclusion that said accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle bearing No.HR-06U/9000 by respondent No.1 Mani Ram and petitioner sustained injuries. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.2 : 17.Onus to prove this issue was upon the petitioner. The petitioner has claimed compensation of Rs.15,00,000/- on account of injuries sustained by him in said accident. In case of compensation on 12 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. account of injuries, the Tribunal has to see the nature of injuries, duration of treatment, expenses spent on treatment, pain and suffering, mental agony, special diet and loss of income of injured. In order to prove his claim, petitioner has examined PW3 Dr. Atul Patil and relied upon the medicine bills and hospital bills Ex.P1 to Ex.P17. Perusal of testimony of PW3 Dr. Atul Patil and documentary evidence produced by the petitioner reveals that the petitioner produced no evidence to prove that he received treatment of the injuries allegedly sustained in the alleged accident. Ex.P15 to Ex.P17 are photocopies of medical bills. Although these bills have not been proved as per provisions of Evidence Act, but, it is apparent that these bills pertain to Anil son of Joginder resident of village Chirasmi, Tehsil Ganaur, District Sonepat. PW3 Dr. Atul Patil has also deposed that on 13.3.2012 at about 10.30 AM, he admitted patient Anil son of Joginder, 18 years old, resident of village Chiramsi, Tehsil Gannaur, District Sonepat, whereas petitioner Anil is son of Dil Singh resident of village Jaisingpur, Tehsil Assandh, District Karnal. Ex.P2, Ex.P3, Ex.P9 to Ex.P11 appear to be prescription slips but bear no name of doctor or patient. Remaining medicine bills and hospital bills pertain 13 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. to the month of October, 2014 whereas alleged accident took place on 11.3.2012. petitioner produced no evidence to prove that he took treatment in the month of October, 2014 of the injuries sustained by him in the alleged accident took place on 11.3.2012. So, these medicine bills and hospital bills are of no help to the case of petitioner. 18.In view of above discussions and reasonings, this Tribunal has no hesitation in holding that the petitioner has miserably failed to prove the alleged expenses incurred by him on his treatment of the injuries sustained in the alleged accident, so, the petitioner is not entitled to any compensation. Accordingly, this issue is decided against the petitioner and in favour of the respondents. ISSUE NO.3 : 19.Onus to prove this issue was upon the respondent No.3. To substantiate this issue, no evidence was led by respondent No.3 to prove that offending vehicle was being driven by respondent No.1 in contravention of the terms and conditions of insurance policy. Copy of driving licence Ex.R2/Ex.P23 was produced, from which, it stands proved on record that Ex.R2/Ex.P23 was issued by Licencing Authority, Assandh and is valid w.e.f. 20.3.2006 to 19.3.2026 and the 14 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. accident in question took place on 11.3.2012. Thus, this issue is decided against respondent No.3. RELIEF :- 20.In view of the findings of this Tribunal returned on issues under adjudication, present claim petition fails and the same is hereby dismissed. No order as to costs. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly. File be consigned to records after due compliance.

Sh. Ajay Sehrawat advocate for respondents no. 1 and 2. Sh. Vijay Rajput advocate for respondent No. 3. AWARD This claim petition has been filed under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) by the claimants/petitioners for grant of compensation to the tune of Rs 20 lacs on account of death of Ramnarain son of Tulsi Dass (hereinafter referred to as the deceased) in a motor vehicular accident, which took place on 15.01.2015 at about 09.30 p.m. in the area of Nirthan, District Sonipat due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent no. 1 while driving vehicle bearing No. HR63-B-4003.(hereinafter referred to as the offending vehicle). 2.The case of the petitioners/claimants be first noticed as under- MACT Case No. 07 of 2015 Tulsa Devi etc. Vs. Nawab etc. 3 3.Vijay (PW1) has a brick kiln near village Nirthan. The deceased Ram Narain son of Tulsi Dass, caste Kohri, resident of Rath, District Hamirpur (UP) and Bhanu used to work as labourers in his brick-kiln. On 15.01.2015 at about 09.30 p.m, Vijay (PW1) was taking Ram Narin and Bhanu from village Nirthan for getting the ration purchased for them. Ram Narain and Bhanu were going ahead of Vijay (PW1) on feet with their bicycles. When they reached 10/20 yards towards village Nirthan, then a Tata Canter 407 came from behind, whose driver was driving it with a very fast speed and in a rash and negligent manner and struck against Ram Narain. Vijay (PW1) and Bhanu had a narrow escape. Bhanu also fell down on the road and sustained minor injuries. Ram Narain succumbed to his injuries on the spot. The driver of the canter fled away from the spot leaving his canter on the spot. The registration number of the canter was HR63-B- 4003. The accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the above said Tata 407, due to which Ram Narain expired on the spot. The dead body of deceased Ram Narain was taken into police possession and post mortem examination was got performed by MACT Case No. 07 of 2015 Tulsa Devi etc. Vs. Nawab etc. 4 the Medical officer, General Hospital, Sonipat by Dr. Satish Kumar, Medical Officer, General Hospital, Sonipat. The deceased was working as Pathera under Vijay son of Siri Bhagwan of Sehri, the owner of the brick kiln in the area of Nirthan, District Sonipat and was also keeping the claimants with him at Bhatta of the above mentioned Vijay name with the style of Durga Bhatta. Thus, all the claimants were fully dependent upon the sole income of the deceased since claimant no. 1 is widow, claimants no. 2 to 5 are the minor daughters of deceased, whereas claimant no. 6 is the mother of the deceased. The deceased was the sole earning member of his family but due to untimely premature death due to the accident of deceased Ram Narain, the claimants had no other source of income, properties with them to maintain themselves, who were fully dependency upon the sole income of the deceased Ram Narain. The family of the deceased is known for longevity of life and had he not met with the premature death, he would have lived upto the age of 90 years. The claimant no. 1 is young aged of 30 years widow of Ram Narain, whereas the claimants no. 2 to 5 are minor daughters and the claimant no. 6 is widow mother aged 65 MACT Case No. 07 of 2015 Tulsa Devi etc. Vs. Nawab etc. 5 years of age. The claimants who were fully dependent on the sole income of the deceased Ram Narain. There remained no source of income now to maintain the claimants and the claimant no. 1, the wife of deceased Ram Narain was so shocked due to the uncertain death of her young aged husband Ram Narain that she has become the patient of many diseases and mental troubles. The claimants were fully dependent upon the sole income of the deceased. The deceased left four minor daughters, one widow and one old aged mother behind at the mercy of God. The claimants have no movable and immovable properties nor any funds to maintain themselves. The accident took place due to the sole rash and negligent driving of Tata canter no HR63-B-4003 driven by the respondent no. 1, who was driving the above vehicle under the control and caution of respondent no. 2, the registered owner and the respondent no. 3 the insurer of the vehicle no. HR63-B-4003, the offending vehicle, thus, all the three respondents are liable to pay the claimed compensation jointly and severally to the claimants. At the time of accident the respondent no. 1 was having valid driving licence, valid registration and insurance policy. The MACT Case No. 07 of 2015 Tulsa Devi etc. Vs. Nawab etc. 6 claimants have apparently suffered a great pains, harassment, humiliation, unnecessary torture sufferings, mental and monetary agony, immense loss on account of the death of their bread earner deceased Ram Narain, the husband of claimant no. 1, father of minor four daughters claimants no. 2 to 5 and old aged mother claimant no. 6, though the loss suffered by the claimants cannot be compensated in terms of money yet the claimants claim a sum of Rs. 20 lacs only from the respondents alongwith interest. 4.The respondents no. 1 and 2 filed separate written statement and it has been submitted that the deceased was not earning Rs. 15,000/- per month. His income has been shown on much higher side. No such accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the Tata Canter bearing registration no. HR63-B-4003. The respondent no. 1 was not at fault. He always drives his vehicle at a moderate speed and on his correct hand side of the road by observing all the traffic rules. FIR was registered in this case against respondent no. 1 but that has been registered falsely by the police in connivance with the petitioners. The petitioners have claimed a highly exaggerated amount MACT Case No. 07 of 2015 Tulsa Devi etc. Vs. Nawab etc. 7 on this account to which they are not at all entitled. The vehicle in question did not cause any accident. However, it is correct that the vehicle bearing no. HR63-B-4003 belongs to respondent no. 2, who is a registered owner of this vehicle and respondent no. 1 was the driver on this vehicle. But police falsely involved this vehicle and respondent no. 1 in the accident case. The vehicle Tata Canter HR63-B-4003 belongs to respondent no. 2. No claim has been lodged by the claimants with respondent no. 2. No accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the driver of the Tata Canter bearing registration No. HR63-B-4003 on the alleged date of accident in which the deceased was alleged to have suffered multiple injuries and died. It has been denied that respondent no. 1 had caused the accident by driving vehicle Canter no. HR63-B-4003 at a fast speed and in a rash and negligent manner. In fact, the accident was not caused due to rash and negligent driving of the answering respondent no. 1. Vijay son of Siri Bhagwan has got a false case registered against respondent no. 1 at the behest of the petitioners in order to get false compensation. It has been denied that the deceased suffered multiple and grievous MACT Case No. 07 of 2015 Tulsa Devi etc. Vs. Nawab etc. 8 injuries and died due to those injuries. It has been denied that the petitioners have spent Rs. 80,000/- on the transportation and funeral ceremony of the deceased. The petitioners have given a false and fabricated amount just to grab money for which they are not at all entitled. Though the accident did not cause due to rash or negligent driving of respondent no. 1 yet in case the Court will reach at the conclusion that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 1, then the respondent no. 1 is also not liable to pay any compensation since he is holding a valid driving licence and the vehicle in question which is owned by respondent no. 2 has been duly insured with respondent no. 3 IFFCO TOKIO General Insurance Company, respondent no. 3, then the said Insurance Company i.e. respondent no. 3 is liable to pay the compensation since the vehicle no. HR63-B-4003 was duly insured with respondent no. 3 on the date of accident. It has been denied that the deceased was working as a Pathera on any Durga Bhatta owned by Vijay son of Siri Bhagwan of village Sehri. It has been denied that the family of the deceased was totally dependent upon the income of deceased Ram Narain. Since the MACT Case No. 07 of 2015 Tulsa Devi etc. Vs. Nawab etc. 9 accident did not cause due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 1, so, the respondents no. 1 and 2 are not liable to pay any penny to the petitioners as compensation in this case. It has been denied that the deceased was aged about 35 years. All other allegations contained in the claim petition have been denied and dismissal of the claim petition has been prayed for. 5.The respondent no. 3 filed separate written statement and took preliminary objections inter-alia that the accident in question was caused due to the negligence of the deceased or at least there was contributory negligence on the part of the deceased himself in causing the accident in question. 6.On merits, it has been denied that the deceased was earning Rs. 15,000/- per month from alleged employment. The accident in question appears to have been caused due to the negligence of the deceased himself. It has been denied that an amount of Rs. 80,000/- was incurred on treatment, transportation and last rites. The claimed amount is highly excessive. The allegations of rash and negligent driving on the part of the respondent no. 1 are denied. The MACT Case No. 07 of 2015 Tulsa Devi etc. Vs. Nawab etc. 10 accident in question took place due to the negligence of the deceased himself. It has been denied that Vijay Kumar witnessed the accident. No reason for delay in reporting the FIR has been provided. All other allegations contained in the claim petition have been denied and dismissal of the claim petition has been prayed for. 7. On the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed on 11.09.2015: - 1.Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle bearing registration No. HR63-B-4003 by its driver-respondent no. 1 on 15.01.2015, owned by respondent no. 1, causing death of Ramnarain son of Tulsi Dass as alleged ?

R3 and thereafter, learned counsel for respondent no. 3 closed the evidence of respondent no. 3. 11.Learned counsel for the petitioners / claimants closed the rebuttal evidence without leading any. 12.Shri Jai Parkash Chhikara advocate for the claimants/petitioners and Shri Ajay Sehrawat advocate for the MACT Case No. 07 of 2015 Tulsa Devi etc. Vs. Nawab etc. 12 respondent nos. 1 and 2 and Sh. Vijay Rajput advocate for respondent no. 3 have been heard at length and the record of the case has been very carefully gone through. My issue-wise findings on various issues are as under – ISSUE NO. 1 13.For proving this issue, the claimants/petitioners have relied upon the statement of Vijay PW1 and Tulsa Devi PW2 besides placing reliance upon certified copy of challan Ex. P1, certified copy of PMR Ex. P2, certified copy of FIR Ex. P3. 14.The first information report no. 0027 dated 16.01.2015 under sections 279,304-A IPC was lodged with the Police Station, Sadar, Sonipat pertaining to this accident and the same is on record as Ex. P3. It was lodged on the statement of Vijay son of Siri Bhagwan (PW1) and it contains the registration number of the offending vehicle i.e. Tata 407 bearing registration no. HR63-B-4003. It has been mentioned in FIR Ex. P1 by its author Vijay son of Siri Bhagwan (PW1) that he has a brick kiln near village Nirthan. The deceased Ram Narain son of Tulsi Dass, caste Kohri, resident of Rath, District MACT Case No. 07 of 2015 Tulsa Devi etc. Vs. Nawab etc. 13 Hamirpur (UP) and Bhanu used to work as labourers in his brick-kiln. On 15.01.2015 at about 09.30 p.m, Vijay (PW1) was taking Ram Narin and Bhanu from village Nirthan for getting the ration purchased for them. Ram Narain and Bhanu were going ahead of Vijay (PW1) on feet with their bicycles. When they reached 10/20 yards towards village Nirthan, then a Tata Canter 407 came from behind, whose driver was driving it with a very fast speed and in a rash and negligent manner and struck against Ram Narain. Vijay (PW1) and Bhanu had a narrow escape. Bhanu also fell down on the road and sustained minor injuries. Ram Narain succumbed to his injuries on the spot. The driver of the canter fled away from the spot leaving his canter on the spot. The registration number of the canter was HR63-B-4003. The accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the above said Tata 407, due to which Ram Narain expired on the spot. 15.Vijay while appearing as PW1 has reiterated the facts mentioned in the FIR Ex. P3 on oath in his affidavit Ex. PW1/A given by him in his examination-in-chief. He has categorically stated that the accident took place on 15.01.2015 at about 09.30 p.m, in the area of MACT Case No. 07 of 2015 Tulsa Devi etc. Vs. Nawab etc. 14 Nirthan, District Sonipat due to the rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent no. 1 while driving the offending vehicle i.e. Tata 407 bearing registration no. HR63-B-4003, due to which Ramnarain expired at the spot. Nothing has come in the cross-examination of Vijay (PW1), from which, it could be said that the accident had not taken place in the manner as alleged and deposed by him. 16.As against this cogent oral as well as documentary evidence regarding the manner of the accident, no evidence whatsoever has been led by the respondents. Neither the respondent no. 1 has stepped into the witness box to rebut the allegations and the evidence led by the claimants/ petitioners regarding the manner of accident nor the respondent no. 3 has led any evidence in this regard. 17.Certified copy of challan Ex. P1 shows that the respondent no. 1 has been facing trial pertaining to FIR Ex. P3. It has been held by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Shyam and others 1993(2) Punjab Law Reporter 109 that “where a person was facing trial for causing the accident, it is to be presumed that the accident has taken place due to rash and MACT Case No. 07 of 2015 Tulsa Devi etc. Vs. Nawab etc. 15 negligent driving of the driver”. Similar view has been taken by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Gurdeep Kaur Vs. Tarsem Singh 2008(2) RCR(Civil) 774 at page 775(H). 18. Therefore, no other view is possible except to hold that the accident had taken place on 15.01.2015 due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 1 while driving the offending vehicle i.e. Tata 407 bearing registration no. HR63-B-4003, due to which Ramnarain expired at the spot. The death of deceased Ramnarain is not only proved from the statement of Vijay PW1, but also from the copy of post mortem report Ex. P2. Therefore, this issue is accordingly decided in favour of the claimants/petitioners and against the respondents. ISSUE NO. 2 19.It has been pleaded by the claimants/petitioners in para no. 4 and 5 of claim petition that the deceased Ramnarain was working as Pathera at Durga Bhatta, Sehri, Tehsil Kharkhoda, District Sonipat and he was earning Rs. 15,000/- per month. Claimants / petitioners have also examined Vijay Kumar PW1 and claimant / petitioner no. 1 as PW2 to prove that the deceased was earning Rs. 15,000/- per month MACT Case No. 07 of 2015 Tulsa Devi etc. Vs.

But there is no documentary proof to prove that the deceased was earning Rs. 15,000/- while working as Pathera at Durga Bhatta Company.

Sarla Verma and others Vs Delhi Transport Corporation and others 2009 (3) RCR(Civil) 77 and therefore, the monthly dependency comes to Rs 6075/-.

According to detailed mark certificate Mark A, the deceased was of the age of 37 years at the time of accident Therefore, the multiplier of ‘15’ should be applied as laid down in Smt. Sarla Verma and others Vs Delhi Transport Corporation and others (supra). This takes the compensation amount to Rs 16,40,160/-. (Rs Sixteen Lacs Forty Thousand One Hundred Sixty Only). An amount of Rs 1,00,000/- (Rs one lac) is awarded towards loss of consortium, an amount Rs 1,00,000/- (Rs one lac) is awarded towards loss of care and guidance for minor children, an amount of Rs 25,000/- (Rs twenty five thousand) is awarded towards funeral expenses, an amount of Rs 25,000/- (Rs twenty five thousand) is awarded towards pain, loss and sufferings and an amount of Rs 3000/- is awarded towards transportation expenses as per the law laid down in Sanobanu’s case (supra) .

However, learned counsel for the respondents No. 1 & 2 have tendered the documents Ex. R1 to Ex. R5 . 12.I have heard learned counsels appearing on behalf of both sides and perused the record carefully. My issue-wise findings along with reasons are as under:- ISSUE NO. 1 :- IN THE COURT OF SUSHIL KUMAR, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 174/173 of 2015 Mukesh etc. Vs. Trishpal etc. and Durgawati etc. Vs. Trishpal etc 9 D.O.D. 01.04.2016 13.In order to prove this issue petitioners have examined PW 1 Jagdish who has tendered his affidavit Ex. PW 1/A in his evidence.

He has also stated that deceased Bablu Singh and Sandeep were hit by the alleged offending vehicle and when they fell down, they were run over by the alleged offending vehicle. He has also proved the copy of FIR Ex. P1 which was registered on his statement against the driver of the alleged offending vehicle. He has also placed on record the postmortem report of Sandeep Ex. P2 and postmortem report of Bablu Ex. P3 which show that Bablu and Sandeep died due to the injuries which were antemortem in nature. Since the respondents have not produced any evidence, this Tribunal has no reason to disbelieve the evidence of petitioners. Therefore, issue No. 1 is decided in favour of petitioners. ISSUE No. 2:- Mukesh & Others Vs. Trishpal & Others:- IN THE COURT OF SUSHIL KUMAR, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 174/173 of 2015 Mukesh etc. Vs. Trishpal etc. and Durgawati etc. Vs. Trishpal etc 10 D.O.D. 01.04.2016 14.PW 3 Mukesh has deposed that his son Sandeep was aged about 10 years and he died due to the injuries sustained in the accident. He has stated that Sandeep was studying in 4th Class in Golden Vally English School, Sonepat and he was a very brilliant student. Had he not died in the said accident, he might have become an Engineer/Doctor/Chartered Accountant and might have upgraded the standard of living of the petitioners. They have also stated that an amount of 50,000/- was incurred ₹ on the last rites of the deceased. 15.The petitioners have claimed compensation of ₹50,00,000/-. The deceased Sandeep was aged about 10 years only and he was not ear ning anything. It has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Lata Vadhwa Vs. State of Bihar 2001 (8) SCC 197 that in cases of young children of tender age, in view of the uncertainties abound, neither their income at the time of death nor the prospect s of future increase in their income nor chances of adv ancement of their carreer are capable of proper determination on estimated basis. Therefore, neither the income of the IN THE COURT OF SUSHIL KUMAR, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 174/173 of 2015 Mukesh etc. Vs. Trishpal etc. and Durgawati etc. Vs. Trishpal etc 11 D.O.D. 01.04.2016 deceased child is capable of assessment on estimated basis nor the financial loss suffered by the parents is capable of mathematical computation. 16.In case of State of Haryana Vs. Jasbir Kaur 2003 (2) Apex Cour Judgments 390, Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the courts and Tribunal have a duty to weigh the various factors and quantify the amount of compensation which should be just. It was further held that the determination of damages for human life is a extremely difficult task and it becomes more baffling when the deceased is a child or a nor earning person because the future of a child is uncertain. 17.In case of Manwari Vs. Harsh Vardhan 2010 ACJ 1977 (Delhi) deceased was a girl of six years and claimant was her mother. Notional income was taken at 15,000/- per annum and multiplier ₹ of 15 was adopted. 75,000/- were granted for loss of love and affection, ₹ loss of company of child and pain and sufferings and a total of compensation of 3,00,000/- was ₹ awarded to the mother of the deceased.

Trishpal etc 12 D.O.D. 01.04.2016 18.The above said case was decided in the year 2010 i.e about 6 years ago. Keeping in view the increase in the prices of commodities, this Tribunal is of the considered opinion that the ends of justice would be met if the compensation of 5,00,000/- is awarded to the claimants. Therefore, it ₹ is held that the petitioners Mukesh & Others are entitled to compensation of 5,00,000/- only. ₹ Durgawati & Others Vs. Trishpal & Others:- 19.PW 2 Smt. Durgawati is widow of deceased Bablu Singh. She has stated that the deceased was diploma holder in Mechanical Engineering, but he was running a fast food stall near ITI Chowk, and was also agent of JKV Credit Society. The petitioners have stated that the deceased was earning 30,000/- per month. The petitioners have placed on record the ₹ Intermediate Examination Certificate Ex. P6, statement s of marks of diploma holder in Mechanical Engineering Ex. P7 to Ex. P10 and Identity Card of deceased Bablu Singh issued by JKV Credit Cooperative Society. However, they have not produced any documentary evidence regarding IN THE COURT OF SUSHIL KUMAR, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 174/173 of 2015 Mukesh etc. Vs. Trishpal etc. and Durgawati etc. Vs. Trishpal etc 13 D.O.D. 01.04.2016 income of the deceased. Keeping in view the qualification of the deceased, it is presumed that the deceased must have been earing at least 10,000/- ₹ per month. As per Intermediate Examination Certificate Ex. 5, date of birth of the deceased was 04.06.1988. It apparently shows that on the date of accident i.e 25.02.2015, the age of the deceased was about 27 years. In view of law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Rajesh Vs. Rajbir 2013 ACJ 1403, 50% income of the deceased is to be added for future prospectus. Therefore, income of the deceased is presumed to be ₹ 15000/- per month which comes to 1,80,000/- per annum (Rs. One lac ₹ eighty thousands only). Since there are more than 3 dependents of the deceased, 1/4th income of the deceased is liable to be deducted towards his personal expenses. After deducting 1/4th income of the deceased towards his personal expenses, annual loss of dependency comes to 1,35,000/- only ₹ (Rs. One lac thirty five thousand only). Since the age of the deceased was between 26 to 30 years, the multiplier of 17 is applicable. By applying the IN THE COURT OF SUSHIL KUMAR, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 174/173 of 2015 Mukesh etc. Vs. Trishpal etc. and Durgawati etc. Vs. Trishpal etc 14 D.O.D. 01.04.2016 multiplier of 17, total loss of income comes to 22,95,000/- (Rs. Twenty ₹ two lacs ninety five thousands only). 20.Besides, an amount of 1,00,000/- for loss of consortium, ₹ ₹ 1,00,000/- for loss of care and guidance of minor children and 25,000/- ₹ for funeral expenses are also allowed to the petitioners. 21.In view of my above discussion, it is concluded that petitioners Durgawati & others are entitled to compensation of 25,20,000/- only (Rs. ₹ Twenty five lacs twenty thousands only). Therefore, this issue is partly decided in favour of petitioners. ISSUES NO. 3:- 22.The onus to prove these issues is on the respondents, but these issues were not pressed by learned counsel for the respondents during course of argument. Hence, these issues are decided against the respondents. RELIEF:- IN THE COURT OF SUSHIL KUMAR, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 174/173 of 2015 Mukesh etc. Vs. Trishpal etc. and Durgawati etc. Vs. Trishpal etc 15 D.O.D. 01.04.2016 23.In view of my above discussion on the aforesaid issues, both claim petitions are allowed with costs in favour of petitioners and against respondents. 24.It is held that petitioners Durgawati and others are entitled to compensation of 25,20,000/- only (Rs. Twenty five lacs twenty thousands ₹ only), recoverable from respondents jointly and severally along with interest @ 8% per annum from the date of filing of petition till realisation.

Present:Shri Dinesh Kumar Bedi, Advocate for the petitioner. Shri Ramesh Choudhary, Adv. for respondent no. 1 & 2. Shri Surender Malik, Adv for respondent no.3. AWARD : This claim petition has been filed by the petitioner under Section 166 R/w Section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) for compensation in respect of injuries sustained by him as a result of the motor vehicular accident, which took place on 14.03.2015, due to rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent no.1. 2.The case of the petitioner, in brief, is that on 14.03.2015 the claimant was coming from Karnal side and was going to Sonepat to Tarun vs Amar Nath etc 3 attend the funeral ceremony of the father of Sonali (since deceased) in a car bearing registration no. HR-42C-5000, which is owned by Lalit Tuteja son of Ved Parkash, R/o House No.193/14, Ashok Nagar, Tehsil Ganaur, Distt. Sonepat, who is the real brother of Yatin (deceased) and the car was being driven by Aman Chandna (deceased). The claimant was going to attend the funeral ceremony of Darshan Lal, father of Sonali (deceased) and Sonali was also accompanying them along with her friends Neha (deceased), Sanjana (deceased), Aman Chandna (deceased) son of Virender Chandna, Yatin Tuteja (deceased) and Ruby Thakur daughter Raftar Singh on 14.03.2015 in the above said car. When they reached near Tau Devi Lal Chowk, Karnal their car entered into an under construction flyover on the National Highway No.1. Neither any diversion/ reflectors were installed nor there was any barricades to stop the entrance of vehicles at the starting point of under construction flyover. One Dumper bearing registration No.RJ-36GA/1492 (hereinafter called as offending vehicle), which was coming from the opposite side i.e. from the side of Panipat towards Ambala, being driven by respondent no.1 in a rash and negligent manner and at a very high speed came towards the car of claimant and dashed against into the car, in which the claimant along with his friends were seated. The accident was caused due to sole rash Tarun vs Amar Nath etc 4 and negligence of respondent no.1 and the car in which claimant was traveling, was totally damaged and claimant along with all the occupants received multiple, grievous injuries on the vital organs of their bodies and five occupants succumbed to the injuries received in the said accident. Whereas claimant and one Rubi Thakur received serious and grievous injuries and were admitted in Kalpna Chawla Hospital, Karnal and from where he was referred to PGIMS, Chandigarh and from where he was brought to Tulip Hospital, Sonepat. Where he remained admitted from 14.03.2015 to 20.03.2015 and got treatment for the injuries sustained in the said accident. The claimant received a fracture in his left femur bone and the bone came out from his body. He also received injuries on his right hand and was operated and a rod was inserted and both wrists of claimant were also operated. He is still under treatment. The claimant has incurred expenditure more than Rs. Three lac on his treatment, medicines, special diet, attendant, transportation and other expenses and claimant was a student of Hotel Management and was studying at Mohali. Due to said accident precious year of the claimant has been ruined as he has not been able to appear in his final examination. FIR no. 160 dated 14.03.2015 under Section 279 and 304A of IPC was registered at the police station Civil Lines, Karnal on the statement of HC Manjeet against Tarun vs Amar Nath etc 5 respondent no.1, who was on night patrolling duty and was present at the spot and has eye-witnessed the accident. Thus, the petitioner has claimed an amount of Rs.50,00,000/- as compensation from the respondents being the driver, the owner and insurer of the offending vehicle. 3.The respondents no. 1 and 2 filed joint written statement controverting the claim of the petitioner. Several preliminary objections were also raised such as cause of action; estopple; maintainability; mis- joinder and non-joinder. Factum and manner of the accident has been denied. The truck as alleged was parked in brake down condition in the kachha portion of construction zone. Respondents have no role to play in causing the accident. It was pleaded that false case has been registered against him just to extract compensation. The accident occurred due to the sole negligence driving of duster car. Even, respondent no.1 was not on the wheel at the time of accident rather one Satish Kumar, Supervisor of the M/s SOMA Co. was taking rest in the said truck, which was parked on the Kachha portion. The amount of compensation claimed by the petitioner is exorbitant and without any basis. A false case has been registered against respondent no.1 in collusion with the local police in order to extract money from the answering respondents. Particulars regarding age and expenses of the injured have been denied. The instant Tarun vs Amar Nath etc 6 claim petition is not legally maintainable. Denying all other allegations, prayer for dismissal of the claim petition has been made. 4. Respondent no.3 filed his separate written statement submitting that that the respondent no.1 was not holding any driving license at the time of the accident and as such insurance company is not liable to indemnify the insured. He had also violated the provisions of Section 134 of the Act by failing to inform the insurer about the mishap and the other relevant information required for accepting the claim. It has been further urged that the alleged offending Dumper was being driven without route permit, fitness certificate and registration certificate etc. It is alleged that the accident was not caused due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1. Respondent no.1 as well as dumper No.RJ-36GA-1492 have been falsely implicated in this case. Accident was caused due to over speed and rash and negligent driving of Car No.HR42C-5000. HC Manjeet made a concocted story. It was denied that the petitioner sustained grievous injuries and fracture on various parts of his body and was taken to PGIMS, Chandigarh and tulip Hospital, Sonepat and remained under treatment. It was submitted that Truck in question was in break down condition and respondent no.1 was Tarun vs Amar Nath etc 7 not in the truck. The entire story of FIR and claim petition is the creation of claimant in collusion with the police in order to extract the amount of compensation. All the medical certificates have also been prepared falsely. The Insurance company is thus not liable to indemnify the insured as respondent No.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. Particulars of study and treatment record of petitioner are denied. A false case has been registered against the answering respondent in order to extract money. The respondent no.3 was not having any insurable interest in the vehicle in question at the time of alleged accident. Rests of the allegations were denied and prayer for dismissal of the petition has been made. 5. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed : 1.Whether the injuries to petitioner Tarun Munjal are the result of accident which took place on 14.03.2015 due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle bearing regd. No.RJ-36GA/1492 by its driver i.e. respondent no.1 ? OPP. 2.If issue no.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation the petitioner is entitled to and from whom?OPP. Tarun vs Amar Nath etc 8 3.Whether the respondent no.1 was not holding a valid driving license at the time of accident and the offending vehicle had violated the terms and conditions of the Insurance policy, if so its effect ? OPR 4. Relief. 6.In his evidence, petitioner has examined Dr S.P Sharma as PW1, Dr. Jagjit Singh as PW2, Claimant/injured himself as PW3, PW4 Dr. Akhil Saxena as PW4, Surender Kumar as PW5, Shri Jaswinder Singh, Criminal Ahlmad in the court of Shri Amit Sheoran, ld. JMIC Karnal as PW6 and HC Manjeet (eye-witness) as PW7, besides producing the following documents: Ex.P1 :Disability certificate, Ex.P2 to Ex.P94 :Medical bills/proscription slips MLR Ex.P95 :College fee certificate. Ex.P116 :Certified copy of FIR no.160/2015 Ex.P117 to 120 :Bills issued by Sandhu Punia Complex Ex P6/1 to P6/21 :Copies of various documents from criminal case record. Tarun vs Amar Nath etc 9 7. On the other hand, respondents have examined respondent no.1 Amar Nath Mishra as RW1 and documents Ex.R1 to Ex.R13 and document Ex.RA were tendered in evidence of respondents. 8.I have appraised the evidence on record, the material circumstances of the case and heard the arguments addressed by the learned counsel for the parties. My findings on the aforesaid issues are as under: ISSUE NO. 1 9.It is petition under section 166 of the MV Act. In order to prove these issues, petitioner Tarun appeared as PW3 and reiterated the averments made in the petition and stated that he was coming from Karnal side and was going to Sonepat to attend the funeral ceremony of father of Sonali in a duster car bearing registration no. HR 42C-5000, owned by Lalit Tuteja, who is real brother of deceased Yatin. When they reached near Tau Devi Lal Chowk, Karnal, their car entered into an under construction bridge on the High way as no diversion/reflectors were installed. There was also no barricades to stop the entrance of vehicle. At the starting point of under construction bridge, one dumper bearing Tarun vs Amar Nath etc 10 registration No. RJ-36GA-1492 was coming towards Gurudawar, being driven by respondent no.1 in a rash and negligent manner and with high speed and dashed straight into the said Duster car. Due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1, accident took place and in that accident he received grievous injuries and his family spent huge amount on his treatment and he is still under treatment. He was admitted in Tulip Hospital from 14.3.2015 to 20.3.2015 and various other hospitals. It is alleged that accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. He further deposed that one HC Manjeet, No.427, has witnessed of the accident, who was present there and on his statement FIR 160 dated 14.03.2015 was registered. During cross-examination he deposed that accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. 10.PW6 Shri Jaswinder Singh, Criminal Ahlmad, in the Court of Shri Amit Sheoran, Ld. JMIC, Karnal has brought the summoned record of the case titled as State vs Amar Nath Mishra bearing FIR No.160 dated 14.3.2015. He has also proved other documents Ex P6/1 to Ex P6/21. He deposed that Amar Nath is facing trial and charge has been framed in this case on 12.10.2015. Tarun vs Amar Nath etc 11 11.Petitioners examined eye-witness head constable Manjeet Singh as PW7 who deposed that on 14.3.2015 he was posted at police post sector 6 Karnal and on that day at about 5.00 A.M he was on patrolling duty and was present near Gurdwara GT road sector 6 Karnal. He further deposed that he saw the accident caused by driver of Dumpher bearing registration No.RJ 36A-1492 being driven by its driver rashly and negligently without observing the traffic rules. He further deposed that due to accident five persons died at the spot, who were travelling in the car bearing registration HR 42C-5000. Ex P116 is the FIR lodged on his statement by PSI Vikrant. During cross- examination he deposed that the place of occurrence was not meant for routine traffic and the fly over was under construction. He deposed that no other vehicle passed through the spot of accident except the duster car bearing registration HR 42C-5000 and the dumpher bearing No. RJ 36GA-1492. He denied the suggestion that the sign of diversion were fixed before the place of occurrence indicating the diversion of traffic. He denied the suggestion that dumpher bearing No. RJ 36GA-1492 was parked at the spot of accident. He also denied the suggestion that he got false FIR registered against the driver of the dumpher. Tarun vs Amar Nath etc 12 12.Ex. P116 is the FIR no.160 dated 14.3.2015 which was registered on the basis of statement of HC Manjeet and as per FIR Ex P116, complainant Head constable Manjeet Singh alongwith constable Manoj Kumar was present at the spot at about 5.00 A.M and one dumpher after unloading the dust on the bridge came towards gurudwara side and said dumpher was being driven rashly and negligently and in the mean time, as the sign of diversion/reflector were not installed on the road prior to under construction bridge, a duster car bearing registration HR 42C-5000 came straight on the fly over and said dumpher gave a hit to a duster car bearing registration No.HR 42C-5000 coming from the side of Chandigarh. Complainant alongwith constable dashed towards the spot and found all the seven occupants of duster seriously injured and he immediately called the ambulance and got admitted all the injured in the hospital and some young boys died at the spot. The FIR Ex P116 was lodged at 11.18 A.M on 14.3.2015 and as such it is clear that immediately after the accident, the FIR was got registered by complainant HC Manjeet Singh. After the investigation driver of the Dumpher namely Amar Nath was found to have driven the dumpher rashly and negligently. 13.Counsel for the respondents no.1 and 2 Sh Ramesh Chaudhary, argued that false case was got registered against Amar Nath Tarun vs Amar Nath etc 13 Mishra despite the fact that the dumpher was parked on the fly over in a brake down condition. He further argued that the accident occurred due to the fault of the driver of duster Car, who failed to notice the sign of diversion installed on the road and he referred the evidence of RW1 Amar Nath. 14.RW1 Amar Nath deposed that he is driver in Soma Enterprises limited and on 13.3.2015 dumpher No. RJ 36GA-1492 became defective at about 11.30. P.M and he called Vinay Kumar supervisor to send some mechanic. He further deposed he alongwith Satish Kumar supervisor after switching on the parking light, slept in the cabin of dumper due to cold. He further deposed that on 14.3.2015 at about 5.00 A.M he alighted from the dumpher in order to answer the call of nature and in the meantime he heard a loud noise and found that a duster car came at a very high speed on the wrong side and gave a hit to the dumpher after entering in the construction zone. He further deposed the supervisor who was sleeping in the dumpher also received injuries. He called the police and ambulance at the spot. He deposed that accident occurred due to fault of duster. He further deposed that he was wrongly challaned by the police. During cross-examination he deposed that he Tarun vs Amar Nath etc 14 was driver on the vehicle in question at the time of accident. He admitted that he is facing criminal trial and charge has already been framed. 15.In the present case HC Manjeet Singh who is an independent eye witness was examined as PW7 and he has fully supported the case of the claimant that the dumpher was being driven rashly and negligently and accident occurred due to fault of driver of dumpher. Injured Tarun Munjal clearly deposed that accident occurred due to fault of respondent no.1. As PW7 HC Manjeet Singh is an independent person and as the FIR was registered on the statement of HC Manjeet and as such there is no ground to discard his evidence. In these circumstances, the story and the evidence of RW1 that the dumpher was parked at the spot in a brake down condition is not reliable. Respondents no.1 and 2 have not proved the mechanical report that the dumpher was in brake down condition prior to the accident. Respondents have also not examined supervisor who was sleeping in the said dumpher. RW1 Amar Nath is facing trial and therefore, his evidence that the dumpher was in a brake down condition is certainly not reliable. It has clearly been mentioned in FIR that there is no sign of diversion and in these circumstances evidence of RW1 Amar Nath that there was sign of diversion prior to the place of Tarun vs Amar Nath etc 15 accident is also not reliable. As such it is clear that the dumber was being driven rashly and negligently by RW1 Amar Nath at the time of accident. But it has come in the evidence of PW3 that the spot of accident was not meant for routine traffic. It is also clear that duster car entered in the construction zone of fly over. After going through the site plan it is clear that the driver of duster instead of diverting his car towards left side entered in the construction zone of fly over. Therefore, driver of the duster car was also equally responsible for causing the accident. Photographs Ex. R1 to Ex R5 placed on the file clearly shows that the duster car bearing no. HR 42C-5000 entered in the construction zone. As such driver of duster car can certainly avoid the accident if he had been more careful while driving the car and had noticed the under construction bridge. After considering the evidence of injured PW3 Tarun Munjal, PW7 HC Manjeet Singh and evidence of RW1 Amar Nath Mishra and the documents placed on the file and the site plan of the place of accident it is clear that the accident occurred due to contributory negligence of both the drivers i.e respondent no.1, who was driving the dumpher bearing no. RJ-36GA-1492 as well driver of duster car bearing registration No. HR 42C-5000. As per the evidence of PW3 the duster car was being driven by Aman Chandna, who had already expired in the Tarun vs Amar Nath etc 16 same accident. But the owner and the insurer of said duster car were not impleaded as party in the present claim petition. Considering the entire evidence it is clear that drivers of both the vehicles were equally responsible for causing the accident. As the owner and the insurer of the duster car were not impleaded party in the present petition and, therefore, injured/petitioner is entitled to get only 50% amount of compensation from the driver, owner and insurer of dumpher bearing registration No. RJ36 GA-1492. Hence, this issue is partly decided in favour of the petitioner. Issue No. 2: 16. There is no doubt that petitioner Tarun Munjal was travelling in the duster car bearing registration no. HR 42C-5000 at the time of accident and he received serious injuries in the accident. As such petitioner is entitled to get compensation regarding the injuries suffered by him in the accident. Several witnesses were examined by the petitioner to prove the injuries and the amount spent by the petitioner on his medical treatment. PW3 Tarun Munjal testified that after the accident he was shifted to Kalpana Chawla Hospital Karnal, from where he was referred to PGIMS Chandigarh, since the condition of the petitioner was very serious but instead of taking the claimant to Chandigarh, the Tarun vs Amar Nath etc 17 relatives of the petitioner brought the claimant to Tulip Hospital Sonepat where he remained admitted from 14.3.2015 to 20.3.2015 and got treatment for the injuries sustained in the accident. He received injuries on his right femur bone and the bone came out from the body of the claimant. His right hand got operated and rod was inserted and wrists of both the hands had also been operated upon. He is still under treatment. He became permanent disabled. His family spent more than Rs 8 lac on his treatment, medicines. He produced on record Follow up Medical record/bills are Ex P2 to 94 and disability certificate Ex P1. He has suffered physical as well mental agony besides suffering financial loss. 17 In order to prove disability certificate Dr. SP Sharma appeared as PW1 and he proved disability certificate Ex P1 of petitioner. He deposed that the patient was having 20% disability. In cross examination he stated that the disability is likely to improve with passage of time. As per disability certificate Ex. P1 petitioner suffered 20% temporary disability and his condition is likely to improve. 18. PW2 Dr. Jagjit Singh deposed that Tarun was admitted in hospital on 14.3.2015 and was discharged on 20.3.2015. Tarun vs Amar Nath etc 18 Patient was operated upon for the injuries. He proved medical bills Ex P2 to Ex P93 and discharge summary Ex P94. 19.PW4 Dr. Akhil Saxena deposed that Tarun Munjal was admitted in their hospital on 14.3.2015 and was discharged on 20.3.2015. Initially the patient had multiple fractures left hip, left leg,left wrist and left arm. He was treated and operated by Orthopedic surgeon Dr. Gagan Kansal. He proved discharge summary Ex P94 and bills Ex P2 to Ex P88. He identified and verified the bills. 20. From the afore-discussed evidence, it stands proved that petitioner suffered multiple injuries. A perusal of copy of medical record, discharge slip, medical bills etc reveals that the petitioner was got operated for the injuries suffered due to accident. Therefore, there is no gainsaying that the petitioner is entitled to get compensation for the injuries sustained by him in the accident in question. 21. It is settled law that the Motor Vehicles Act is a welfare legislation. It has been promulgated to give relief to the injured of road side accidents. The contents of the petitions for claim are not to be Tarun vs Amar Nath etc 19 substantiated strictly by the Indian Evidence Act in the like manner in cases concerning to civil as well as criminal nature. Therefore, the provisions concerning to valid exhibition of medical bills can be ignored, particularly when a representative of the hospital, where the medical store is situated, has authenticated the same as has been done in the instant case. Therefore, the medical bills despite the objections raised by the opposite side can be considered for grant of compensation in favour of the petitioner. 22. The petitioner must have undergone the agony of physical as well as mental pain and sufferings on account of the injuries received in the accident. No hard and fast rule can perhaps be laid down for assessing the compensation for the pain and sufferings undergone by an injured. However, the nature of the injuries, parts of the body involved, the period of hospitalization, the period required for recovery from the injuries and age and socio-economic conditions of the injured can be the guiding factors. PW2 Dr.Jagjit, PW4 Dr. Akhil Saxena have proved bills. There is no rebuttal evidence against the same. Tarun vs Amar Nath etc 20 23 The disability of the petitioner has been proved on record by PW1 Dr. SP Sharma , SMO GH, Sonepat, who has testified that on 25.8.2015 he was member of the board alongwith Dr Adarsh and Dr. C.P. Arora to assess the disability suffered by Tarun aged 19 years male. He was having 20% temporary disability. He proved disability certificate Ex P1. 24. No evidence in rebuttal has been led by the respondents. However, keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case as well as the documents i.e. the medical bills, prescription slips regarding consultation the following reasonable amount of compensation is assessed to be paid to the petitioner : 1. Medical Bills : Rs 5,60,775 2. Pain and Suffering : Rs. 20,000 3. Special Diet/Attendant : Rs. 20,000/- Charges/Hospitalization 4 Transportation Charge : Rs. 10,000/- 5 Disability : Rs 40,000/- Total : Rs. 6,50,775 /- Tarun vs Amar Nath etc 21 Accordingly, the petitioner is held entitled to get a sum of Rs. 6,50,775 /- (in round figure Rs 6,50,800/-) as compensation along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum to be calculated thereon from the date of the filing of the petition till realization. Accordingly, issue no.2 is partly decided in favour of the petitioner, as accident occurred due to contributory negligence of both the drivers i.e respondent no.1 who was driving the dumpher bearing no. RJ-36GA-1492 as well driver of duster car bearing registration No.HR 42C-5000 and therefore, being case of contributory negligence, petitioner/injured is entitled to recover 50% amount of the total compensation i.e Rs 3,25,400/- of total Rs 6,50,800/-. ISSUES NO.3 &4 : 25As per my findings on issues no.1 and 2 petition is very much maintainable. The ld. counsel for respondent no.3 argued that respondent no.1 was not having valid driving license at the time of accident. As per copy of driving license Ex.R6 placed on record, respondent No.1 was having a valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident. Tarun vs Amar Nath etc 22 Respondent no.3 failed to prove the fact that driving license Ex R6 was fake and not valid license. 26In view of the above discussion, issues no.3 and 4 are decided against respondent no.2 Insurance company. RELIEF: 27 In view of my findings on the aforesaid issues, the claim petition is allowed in part with costs and a compensation of Rs. 3,25,400/- i.e. 50% amount of the total amount of Rs. 6,50,800/- is awarded to the petitioner along with interest at the rate of 7.5 per cent per annum to be calculated thereon from the date of the petition till realization. The compensation amount of Rs 3,25,400/- along with proportionate interest shall be paid to petitioner in cash Respondent no.3 is directed to give Rs 3,25,400/ i.e. 50% amount of the total amount of Rs. 6,50,800/- to the petitoner, as accident occurred due to contributory negligence of both the drivers i.e respondent who was driving the dumpher bearing no. RJ-36GA-1492 as well driver of duster car bearing registration No.HR 42C-5000.

Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 3 2.The case of the petitioners, in brief, is that on 28.3.2015 Ravinder, (since deceased) was driving the canter no. HR 67A-0784 and at about 5.00 A.M., when he reached in the area of GT road village Barhi, the offending vehicle canter no. HR 55F-9791 was wrongly parked on the GT road without any signal/indicator to alert the vehicles coming from back side and creating a snag in the way of traffic and due to darkness and light of the vehicles coming from front side, said Ravinder could not see the said wrongly parked vehicle and vehicle of Ravinder hit against the said parked vehicle and accident took place and in the said accident Ravinder sustained grievous injuries on his person and his vehicle went by the side of the road and Ravinder died at the spot due to injuries sustained in the accident. The accident was witnessed by Umesh and on his statement, case FIR No.141 dated 28..3.2015 under section 283 and 304A IPC was registered at police station Ganaur. It has been pleaded that the accident took place due to negligent parking of offending vehicle by respondent no.1. It has been further pleaded that deceased was 25 years of age . The deceased was working as driver and getting salary of rs. 15,000/- per month And used to contribute his whole income for the welfare and maintenance of the claimants. The claimants were fully dependent upon him. It has been pleaded that accident was Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 4 caused by respondent no.1 by driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner without caring the rules of the traffic and respondent no.2 is owner and respondent no.3 is insurer of the offending vehicle. It has been pleaded that the petitioners have suffered great pain, mental torture and agony besides financial loss due to sudden and premature death of Ravinder Kumar. The claimants claim Rs 50.00 lac as compensation on account of death of Ravinder in a Motor Vehicle Act. 3.The respondents no. 1 and 2 filed their joint written statement controverting the claim of the petitioners. It has been pleaded that no accident was caused by the vehicle of answering respondents. The answering respondents have been falsely implicated. A false case has been registered against the answering respondent no.1. The respondent no.1 had a valid driving license. Denying all other averments, prayer for dismissal of the claim petition has been made. 4. In the written statement filed by respondent no.3, certain preliminary objections regarding maintainability etc were taken. It was pleaded that no accident ever took place with vehicle bearing registration no. HR 55F-9791. But accident took place due to rash and Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 5 negligent driving of deceased himself. It has been pleaded that deceased also contributed to the cause of the alleged accident. The respondent no.1 never informed the answering respondent about the accident if any. It was submitted that respondent No.1 was not holding any driving licence, etc at the time of the accident and as such insurance company is not liable to indemnify the insured. The entire story mentioned in the FIR and claim petitions is the creation of claimants in collusion with the police in order to extract the amount of compensation. The FIR was registered on the statement of cousin of deceased, who had not witnessed the accident. All the documents have also been prepared falsely. The Insurance company is thus not liable to indemnify the insured as respondent No.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. Insurance company also denied the personal particulars of the deceased with regard to his income, age etc. The amount claimed by the petitioners is excessive and exorbitant and has no relevancy to the alleged loss. Rest of the contentions were denied and prayer for dismissal of the petition has been made. 5. On the pleadings of the parties following issues were framed : Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 6 1.Whether the accident in question resulting into the death of Ravinder son of Shri Chandan Sahini had occurred on account of Motor Vehicular accident dated 28.3.2015 at about 5.00.A.M in the area of village Barhi GT Road, Sonepat by respondent no.1 on account of rash and negligent and wrong parking of offending vehicle container bearing registration no. HR 55 F-9791?OPP. 2.If issue no.1 is decided in favour of the claimants, whether the claimants are entitled to claim amount as claimed in the claim petition and from whom ? OPP. 3.Whether the petition is not maintainable in the present form?OPR 4.Whether insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation? OPR3. 5. Relief. 6.In the evidence of the petitioners. Petitioner Urmila herself appeared as PW2 and e xamined, Umesh eye witness of the alleged accident as PW2, Rakesh Kumar as PW3, besides producing the following documents: Ex.P1 :Copy of report u/s173 Cr.PC Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 7 Ex P2 :Post mortem report Ex.P3 :Copy of Ration card Ex P4 :Copy of RC Ex P5 :DL of Ravinder Ex P6 :Copy of superdari order Ex P7 :Site plan Ex P8 : Copy of RC of vehicle of respondent no.1 Ex P9 :DL of respondent no.1 7. On the other hand, no evidence has been led on behalf of the respondents. The respondents have tendered documents Ex R1 to R8. 8.I have appraised the evidence on record, the material circumstances of the case and heard the arguments addressed by the learned counsel for the parties. My findings on the aforesaid issues are as under: Issue No.1 : 9.In order to prove this issue, petitioner has stepped into the witness box as PW2 and tendered her affidavit Ex. PW2/A reiterating the Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 8 facts as mentioned in the petition and deposed that the accident took place due to rash and negligent parking on the part of the respondent no.1 and due to said accident, her son died. They suffered financial loss and mental agony. She deposed that her son was 25 years of age. He was earning Rs.25,000/- per month as he was driver and used to contribute his all income for the welfare and maintenance of claimants and they were dependent upon the income of deceased. 10.PW1 Umesh, who is eye witness of the accident has corroborated the version of PW2 and stated that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent parking of offending vehicle by respondent no.1. He further deposed that at the time of accident he was following the deceased in another vehicle and at about 5.00A.M when their vehicle reached in the area of GT Road Barhi, many vehicles were coming from front side on another side of GT road and their lights were bowing on their side . He further deposed that canter no. HR 55F-9791 was wrongly parked on the GT road without any indicator to warn the vehicles coming from behind and said Ravinder could not see the said parked vehicle and his vehicle hit against the wrongly parked vehicle and accident took place and Ravinder sustained injuries and died at the spot. FIR No. 141 dated Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 9 28.3.2015 under section 283 and 304A IPC was registered against respondent no.1.on his statement. There is no ground to disbelieve the evidence of PW1 Umesh particularly when the FIR Ex.P1 was registered within few hours of the accident against the driver of vehicle no. HR-55F 9791 for parking the said vehicle in the middle of the road resulting inti accident in which Ravinder lost his life. 11. It is the case of the petitioners that on 28.3.2015 deceased Ravinder was going towards Panipat. At about 5.00.A.M when he reached near village Barhi at GT road the offending vehicle bearing registration no. HR 55F-9791 was wrongly parked without any indicator and due to darkness, deceased Ravinder could not see the offending vehicle and his vehicle struck against the offending vehicle on back side and accident took place, due to which Ravinder died at the spot. This evidence is supported by report under section 173 Cr.PC Ex P1 and post mortem report Ex P2 as well as statement of PW1 Umesh eye witness of the alleged accident. 12.The learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the accident took place during night time and there was no indicator or signal Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 10 and as the offending vehicle was standing in the middle of the road and due to that reason, deceased Ravinder Kumar could not see the said vehicle. He further argued that the accident occurred due to the fault of the respondent No.1 as he parked his vehicle in the middle of the road without any indicator. He further argued that there is no negligence on the part of the deceased Ravinder. 13 On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent No.3-insurance company submitted that the evidence of PW1 Umesh is not reliable as he is relative of the deceased. He also argued that the accident occurred due to the fault of the deceased. He further submitted that the accident occurred due to the contributory negligence of deceased and the drivier of offending vehicle no. HR 55F-9791. 14. PW1 Umesh has clearly deposed the manner in which the accident occurred. As per the challan Ex P1 and site plan Ex.P7, the offending vehicle was parked on the road. In view of the evidence of PW1, there was no indicator or signal and due to reflection of light of other vehicles, deceased could not see the offending vehicle standing on the GT road and his canter struck against the said offending vehicle. As Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 11 such the respondent no.1 who was driver of the vehicle no. HR-55F 9791 was certainly negligent and liable for the accident. But the deceased Ravinder is also equally responsible for the accident and the accident could be avoided if the deceased had been vigilant. In a similar circumstance, Honble Apex Court in the case titled Raj Rani and others vs. Oriental Insurance Co.Ltd. and others 2009(4) PLR 789 held that drivers of both the vehicles were equally negligent . In that case also the truck was parked in the middle of the road without parking lights on and the car driver struck his car against the stationary truck. As such, the authority titled as Raj Rani case (supr a) is fully applicable to the facts of the present case. Therefore, the accident occurred due to the contributory negligence of drivers of the container bearing No. HR 55F-9791 and the deceased Ravinder Kumar. 15. In view of my above discussion, it is held that the accident occurred due to the contributory negligence of the driver of Canter HR 55F-9791 and Ravinder, since deceased, who was driving the vehicle no. HR 67A-0784. As such, the responsibility for causing the accident is in the ratio of 50:50 on respondent No.1 Amrik Dass and Ravinder since deceased. And the petitioners/claimants who are legal heirs of deceased Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 12 Ravinder, are entitled to only 50% of the total amount of loss of dependency. Accordingly, this issue is partly decided in favour of the petitioners. Issue No. 2: 16 This claim petition is in respect of death of Ravinder. In this claim petition, petitioner Urmila when appeared in the witness box as PW2 has testified that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. Ex P1 is the copy of report under section 173 Cr.PC. After going through the entire evidence on the file it is clear that deceased Ravinder died due to the injuries suffered in the accident and as such the petitioners are entitled to get compensation. 17.In the claim petition, it has been submitted that the deceased was earning Rs.25,000/- per month as he was driver and he was doing the work of sale and purchase of vehicles on commission basis. PW3 Rakesh deposed that he is owner of canter no. HR 67A-0784 and deceased Ravinder was a driver under his kind control and supervision on a monthly salary of Rs 15,000/- and also used to do business of sale and purchase of vehicles on commission basis with him and as such he used to earn Rs 10,000/- per month. In order to prove the Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 13 income of deceased the petitioner has not placed on record any document to prove the income of deceased. In the absence of which it cannot be said that deceased Ravinder Kumar was earning Rs 25,000/- per month. The petitioner when appeared as PW2 has told the age of deceased as 25 years. In the Post Mortem report Ex. P2 age of the deceased at the time of accident is mentioned as 26 years. In the driving license Ex.P5 of deceased Ravinder, date of birth of Ravinder is mentioned as 18.9.1990. The petitioners have not placed on record any other document to show the age of deceased. The doctor who conducted the post mortem has mentioned the age of deceased as 26 years. As per Ex P5 driving license of deceased Ravinder, he was approximately 26 years of age at the time of accident. The medical evidence also cannot be discarded. Therefore, for the purpose of assessing compensation, it would be proper to consider the age of the deceased as 26 years at the time of his death. 18. Now, coming to the dependency. Petitioner no.1 is mother deceased and petitioners no.2 and 3 are younger brother and sister of deceased Ravinder. It has been stated by PW1 that they were fully dependent on the income of deceased Ravinder. The evidence adduced Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 14 by the petitioner has gone unrebutted on this point. Petitioner no.1 being mother and petitioners no.2 and 3 being younger brother and sister and the petitioners being legal heirs of deceased are entitled to get compensation for the death of the deceased in the ill-fated accident. 19. The petitioner has not placed on record any document to support the allegations that deceased used to earn Rs. 25,000/- per month. In other words he was a young unmarried man and could have earned sufficient monthly income to maintain his family consisting him i.e . his mother etc. Deceased was working as driver. Therefore, the income of the deceased was certainly more than a male casual labourer. Accordingly, for the purpose of assessing the compensation, the income of deceased is assessed at Rs. 10,000/- per month as he was driver. In view of authority titled as Munna Lal Jain vs Vipin Kumar Sharma 2015(6)SCC 347 and Shri Ram General Insurance Company Limited versus Karnail Kaur and others 2015-4, PLR 324 , the deceased being of 26 years of age at the time of his death, 50% income earned by him is to be added as prospects of future income and considering the age of deceased the total income of the deceased after adding 50% of the income comes to Rs. 15,000/-per month. As the deceased was bachelor, 50% amount Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 15 out of the said income is liable to be deducted towards his personal and living expenses as per the directive of the Hon’ble Supreme Court given in Smt. Sarla Verma v. Delhi Transport Corporation 2009(3) RCR(Civil) 77 . By reducing 50% amount, the dependency deserves to be assessed at Rs.7,500/- per month i.e. Rs.90,000/- per annum. Further in view of latest authorities Munna Lal Jain vs Vipin Kumar Sharma 2015(6) SCC 347 and Shri Ram General Insurance Company Limited vs Karnail Kaur and others 2015-4, PLR 324, Amrit Bhanu Shali vs National Insurance Company Ltd. 2012(11) SCC 738, M. Mansoor vs United India Insurance Co.Ltd. 2013(15) SCC 603 , multiplier is to be applied as per age of the deceased and not as per the age of the dependents, despite the fact that deceased was unmarried/bachelor. 20 Taking into consideration the age of the deceased who was 26 years old at time of accident, the multiplier to be applied is of 17. So, the compensation after applying multiplier of 17 comes to Rs. 90,000 x 17=15,30,000/-. In addition to the compensation awarded above, the claimant will also be entitled to a sum of Rs. 25000/- towards funeral expenses. In total, a compensation of Rs.15,55,000/ - is awarded to the Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 16 petitioners along with interest at the rate of 7.5 per cent per annum to be calculated thereon from the date of filing of the petition till realization . 21. The petitioners being Lrs of deceased and dependent on the income of the deceased are entitled to get compensation of Rs 15,55,000/- for the death of the deceased in the ill-fated accident. As the liability od respondents is only 50% and therefore the petitioners are only entitled to get Rs. 7,77,500/-. Accordingly i ssue no.2 is partly decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUES NO.3 AND 4 : 22. The respondent no.2 has raised the plea that the respondent no. 1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the accident. Perusal of copy of driving licence Ex R1 of respondent no.1 reveals that it was valid for driving the vehicle LMV,NT Transport on the date of the accident. The respondent no.3 has not brought any evidence on record to show the driving licence Ex. R1 was fake or invalid on the date of the accident or that the insured violated any other term or condition of the insurance policy. Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 17 LIABILITY; 22.Now, I advert to deal with the question of liability of the respondents to pay compensation. In the written statement respondent no.3 has not claimed that the vehicle bearing registration no. HR 55F- 9791 was not insured. Ex R2 is legal notice given by Sh. H.C. Jain ld. Counsel for respondent no.3 and after going through the legal notice Ex R2 it is clear that respondent no.3 has not disputed the validity of the insurance policy and by way of legal notice Ex. R2, respondent no.3 asked respondents no.1 and 2 to furnish the permit and fitness certificate. Permit and fitness certificate were tendered by respondents no.1 and 2 vide their statement. Ex. R3 is insurance policy and it appears that inadvertently respondents no.1 and 2 have tendered inusrance policy Ex R3 which was effecive from 17.10.2015 to 16.10.2016. It is admitted fact that accident took place on 28.3.2015. Photocopy of cover note dated 17.10.2014 issued by respondent no.3 is already placed on the file. In these circumstances, it cannot be said that vehicle in question was not insurued with respondent no.3, despite the fact that respondent no.2 inadvertently tendered insurance policy Ex R3. But in view of the fact of cover note placed on the file and in view of the fact that respondent no.3 has not disputed the fact that the vehicle in question was not insured with Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 18 insurance company and in these circumstances, respondent no.3 is liable to make the payment of compensatiion. RELIEF: 23 In view of my findings on the aforesaid issues, the claim petition is allowed in part with costs and a compensation of Rs. 7,77,500/- i.e. 50% amount of the total amount of 15,55,000/- is awarded to the petitioners along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per cent per annum to be calculated thereon from the date of the petition till realization, in equal share. The respondent nos. 1 to 3 are held liable to pay the amount of compensation of Rs 7,77,500/- jointly as well as severally. As the vehicle no. HR 55F -9791 was insured with respondent no.3 Insurance Comp any, as per cover note placed on file, therefore respondent no.3 would be liable to make the payment of amount of compensation. On realization of compensation amount along with interest, 50% of the amount alongwith interest accrued thereupon of the respective shares of petitioner Nos.1 to 3, be paid to them in cash and remaining 50% be deposited in the shape of FDRs in their names in any nationalized bank, fetching maximum interest for a period of three years. It is further directed that the amount of share of minor i.e Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 19 respondent no.3 be deposited in some Nationalized bank till he attained majority. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly and file be consigned to record-room.

On 24.10.2014, he admitted patient Anil son of Dil Singh, resident of Jaisingpur, Karnal with the diagnosis old operated fractured femur right side and surgery was done and nail was removed and he was discharged on 26.10.2014. Bills Ex.P2 to Ex.P17 are issued by their hospital. 10.Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has argued that it has been proved that on 11.3.2012, the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1 due to which petitioner received injuries. FIR was lodged against the respondent No.1 which support the case of the petitioner. 11.On the other hand, learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No.3 has argued that petitioner has filed the present petition in collusion with respondents No.1&2. PW1 Virender Singh is a procured witness. No such accident took place. petitioner has filed a 9 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. false claim petition in order to claim compensation from the insurance company. He has further argued that petitioner did not appear in the witness box to prove his case. PW2 Sumit Power of Attorney Holder of petitioner appeared in the witness box but he cannot depose on behalf of petitioner. He was not present at the spot at the time of alleged accident, therefore, he has no personal knowledge about the alleged accident. It was petitioner who could prove his case and he could have been cross-examined on the question of alleged injuries sustained in the alleged accident. So, the claim petition may kindly be dismissed. 12.I have given my thoughtful consideration to the rival submissions advanced by learned counsel for the parties. 13.It is true that petitioner Anil himself did not appear in the witness box to prove his case but there is sufficient evidence on case file to prove the accident in question and it has been proved by oral as well as documentary evidence that the alleged accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle bearing No.HR- 06U/9000 by respondent No.1. The petitioner has also produced the final report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex.P1, site plan Ex.P2 of the 10 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. place of occurrence and First Information Report Ex.P4. 14.It is apparent that Virender Singh appeared in the witness box as PW1 and it was claimed in his affidavit Ex.PW1/A tendered by him in his evidence that on 11.3.2012, Sandeep and his cousin namely Anil were going to village Chirasmi. He witnessed the accident which took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle bearing No.HR-06U/9000 by respondent No.1. PW1 Virender Singh has further deposed that petitioner Sandeep and pillion rider Anil sustained injuries in this accident and he took them to the hospital. Ex.P4 FIR was lodged on the basis of statement of Virender Singh PW1 against respondent No.1 in Police Station, Gannaur. 15.Further, PW1 Virender Singh is subjected to lengthy cross-examination, but nothing came out which may belied his version. FIR Ex.P4 resulted into prosecution of respondent No.1 Mani Ram and vide report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex.P1, a prosecution was launched against respondent No.1. These facts are themselves sufficient corroboration to the testimony of PW1 Virender Singh. Further, the testimony of PW1 Virender Singh has gone unrebutted, as respondent No.1 Mani Ram did not dare to step into witness box to 11 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. substantiate his plea taken in the written statement that no such accident had ever taken place and he has been falsely implicated in the present case. Moreover, had respondent No.1 Mani Ram been falsely implicated in the criminal case, then, he would have filed a complaint to the higher authorities regarding his false involvement, but no such allegation is shown to have been filed. 16.Further it is apparent that FIR against respondent No.1 was registered under Sections 279, 337 and 338 IPC. MLR of petitioner Anil is also on case file. Although, the MLR is not proved but can be taken into consideration. In view of above discussions and reasonings, this Tribunal reached at the conclusion that said accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle bearing No.HR-06U/9000 by respondent No.1 Mani Ram and petitioner sustained injuries. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.2 : 17.Onus to prove this issue was upon the petitioner. The petitioner has claimed compensation of Rs.15,00,000/- on account of injuries sustained by him in said accident. In case of compensation on 12 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. account of injuries, the Tribunal has to see the nature of injuries, duration of treatment, expenses spent on treatment, pain and suffering, mental agony, special diet and loss of income of injured. In order to prove his claim, petitioner has examined PW3 Dr. Atul Patil and relied upon the medicine bills and hospital bills Ex.P1 to Ex.P17. Perusal of testimony of PW3 Dr. Atul Patil and documentary evidence produced by the petitioner reveals that the petitioner produced no evidence to prove that he received treatment of the injuries allegedly sustained in the alleged accident. Ex.P15 to Ex.P17 are photocopies of medical bills. Although these bills have not been proved as per provisions of Evidence Act, but, it is apparent that these bills pertain to Anil son of Joginder resident of village Chirasmi, Tehsil Ganaur, District Sonepat. PW3 Dr. Atul Patil has also deposed that on 13.3.2012 at about 10.30 AM, he admitted patient Anil son of Joginder, 18 years old, resident of village Chiramsi, Tehsil Gannaur, District Sonepat, whereas petitioner Anil is son of Dil Singh resident of village Jaisingpur, Tehsil Assandh, District Karnal. Ex.P2, Ex.P3, Ex.P9 to Ex.P11 appear to be prescription slips but bear no name of doctor or patient. Remaining medicine bills and hospital bills pertain 13 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. to the month of October, 2014 whereas alleged accident took place on 11.3.2012. petitioner produced no evidence to prove that he took treatment in the month of October, 2014 of the injuries sustained by him in the alleged accident took place on 11.3.2012. So, these medicine bills and hospital bills are of no help to the case of petitioner. 18.In view of above discussions and reasonings, this Tribunal has no hesitation in holding that the petitioner has miserably failed to prove the alleged expenses incurred by him on his treatment of the injuries sustained in the alleged accident, so, the petitioner is not entitled to any compensation. Accordingly, this issue is decided against the petitioner and in favour of the respondents. ISSUE NO.3 : 19.Onus to prove this issue was upon the respondent No.3. To substantiate this issue, no evidence was led by respondent No.3 to prove that offending vehicle was being driven by respondent No.1 in contravention of the terms and conditions of insurance policy. Copy of driving licence Ex.R2/Ex.P23 was produced, from which, it stands proved on record that Ex.R2/Ex.P23 was issued by Licencing Authority, Assandh and is valid w.e.f. 20.3.2006 to 19.3.2026 and the 14 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. accident in question took place on 11.3.2012. Thus, this issue is decided against respondent No.3. RELIEF :- 20.In view of the findings of this Tribunal returned on issues under adjudication, present claim petition fails and the same is hereby dismissed. No order as to costs. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly. File be consigned to records after due compliance.

AWARD : This award will dispose of claim petition mentioned above and the same has been filed by the petitioner under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) for compensation in respect of death of Ravinder Kumar as a result of the motor vehicular accident, which took place on 28.3.2015, in the area of village Barhi GT Road, Sonepat, due to rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent no.1. Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 3 2.The case of the petitioners, in brief, is that on 28.3.2015 Ravinder, (since deceased) was driving the canter no. HR 67A-0784 and at about 5.00 A.M., when he reached in the area of GT road village Barhi, the offending vehicle canter no. HR 55F-9791 was wrongly parked on the GT road without any signal/indicator to alert the vehicles coming from back side and creating a snag in the way of traffic and due to darkness and light of the vehicles coming from front side, said Ravinder could not see the said wrongly parked vehicle and vehicle of Ravinder hit against the said parked vehicle and accident took place and in the said accident Ravinder sustained grievous injuries on his person and his vehicle went by the side of the road and Ravinder died at the spot due to injuries sustained in the accident. The accident was witnessed by Umesh and on his statement, case FIR No.141 dated 28..3.2015 under section 283 and 304A IPC was registered at police station Ganaur. It has been pleaded that the accident took place due to negligent parking of offending vehicle by respondent no.1. It has been further pleaded that deceased was 25 years of age . The deceased was working as driver and getting salary of rs. 15,000/- per month And used to contribute his whole income for the welfare and maintenance of the claimants. The claimants were fully dependent upon him. It has been pleaded that accident was Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 4 caused by respondent no.1 by driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner without caring the rules of the traffic and respondent no.2 is owner and respondent no.3 is insurer of the offending vehicle. It has been pleaded that the petitioners have suffered great pain, mental torture and agony besides financial loss due to sudden and premature death of Ravinder Kumar. The claimants claim Rs 50.00 lac as compensation on account of death of Ravinder in a Motor Vehicle Act. 3.The respondents no. 1 and 2 filed their joint written statement controverting the claim of the petitioners. It has been pleaded that no accident was caused by the vehicle of answering respondents. The answering respondents have been falsely implicated. A false case has been registered against the answering respondent no.1. The respondent no.1 had a valid driving license. Denying all other averments, prayer for dismissal of the claim petition has been made. 4. In the written statement filed by respondent no.3, certain preliminary objections regarding maintainability etc were taken. It was pleaded that no accident ever took place with vehicle bearing registration no. HR 55F-9791. But accident took place due to rash and Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 5 negligent driving of deceased himself. It has been pleaded that deceased also contributed to the cause of the alleged accident. The respondent no.1 never informed the answering respondent about the accident if any. It was submitted that respondent No.1 was not holding any driving licence, etc at the time of the accident and as such insurance company is not liable to indemnify the insured. The entire story mentioned in the FIR and claim petitions is the creation of claimants in collusion with the police in order to extract the amount of compensation. The FIR was registered on the statement of cousin of deceased, who had not witnessed the accident. All the documents have also been prepared falsely. The Insurance company is thus not liable to indemnify the insured as respondent No.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. Insurance company also denied the personal particulars of the deceased with regard to his income, age etc. The amount claimed by the petitioners is excessive and exorbitant and has no relevancy to the alleged loss. Rest of the contentions were denied and prayer for dismissal of the petition has been made. 5. On the pleadings of the parties following issues were framed : Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 6 1.Whether the accident in question resulting into the death of Ravinder son of Shri Chandan Sahini had occurred on account of Motor Vehicular accident dated 28.3.2015 at about 5.00.A.M in the area of village Barhi GT Road, Sonepat by respondent no.1 on account of rash and negligent and wrong parking of offending vehicle container bearing registration no. HR 55 F-9791?OPP. 2.If issue no.1 is decided in favour of the claimants, whether the claimants are entitled to claim amount as claimed in the claim petition and from whom ? OPP. 3.Whether the petition is not maintainable in the present form?OPR 4.Whether insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation? OPR3. 5. Relief. 6.In the evidence of the petitioners. Petitioner Urmila herself appeared as PW2 and e xamined, Umesh eye witness of the alleged accident as PW2, Rakesh Kumar as PW3, besides producing the following documents: Ex.P1 :Copy of report u/s173 Cr.PC Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 7 Ex P2 :Post mortem report Ex.P3 :Copy of Ration card Ex P4 :Copy of RC Ex P5 :DL of Ravinder Ex P6 :Copy of superdari order Ex P7 :Site plan Ex P8 : Copy of RC of vehicle of respondent no.1 Ex P9 :DL of respondent no.1 7. On the other hand, no evidence has been led on behalf of the respondents. The respondents have tendered documents Ex R1 to R8. 8.I have appraised the evidence on record, the material circumstances of the case and heard the arguments addressed by the learned counsel for the parties. My findings on the aforesaid issues are as under: Issue No.1 : 9.In order to prove this issue, petitioner has stepped into the witness box as PW2 and tendered her affidavit Ex. PW2/A reiterating the Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 8 facts as mentioned in the petition and deposed that the accident took place due to rash and negligent parking on the part of the respondent no.1 and due to said accident, her son died. They suffered financial loss and mental agony. She deposed that her son was 25 years of age. He was earning Rs.25,000/- per month as he was driver and used to contribute his all income for the welfare and maintenance of claimants and they were dependent upon the income of deceased. 10.PW1 Umesh, who is eye witness of the accident has corroborated the version of PW2 and stated that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent parking of offending vehicle by respondent no.1. He further deposed that at the time of accident he was following the deceased in another vehicle and at about 5.00A.M when their vehicle reached in the area of GT Road Barhi, many vehicles were coming from front side on another side of GT road and their lights were bowing on their side . He further deposed that canter no. HR 55F-9791 was wrongly parked on the GT road without any indicator to warn the vehicles coming from behind and said Ravinder could not see the said parked vehicle and his vehicle hit against the wrongly parked vehicle and accident took place and Ravinder sustained injuries and died at the spot. FIR No. 141 dated Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 9 28.3.2015 under section 283 and 304A IPC was registered against respondent no.1.on his statement. There is no ground to disbelieve the evidence of PW1 Umesh particularly when the FIR Ex.P1 was registered within few hours of the accident against the driver of vehicle no. HR-55F 9791 for parking the said vehicle in the middle of the road resulting inti accident in which Ravinder lost his life. 11. It is the case of the petitioners that on 28.3.2015 deceased Ravinder was going towards Panipat. At about 5.00.A.M when he reached near village Barhi at GT road the offending vehicle bearing registration no. HR 55F-9791 was wrongly parked without any indicator and due to darkness, deceased Ravinder could not see the offending vehicle and his vehicle struck against the offending vehicle on back side and accident took place, due to which Ravinder died at the spot. This evidence is supported by report under section 173 Cr.PC Ex P1 and post mortem report Ex P2 as well as statement of PW1 Umesh eye witness of the alleged accident. 12.The learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the accident took place during night time and there was no indicator or signal Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 10 and as the offending vehicle was standing in the middle of the road and due to that reason, deceased Ravinder Kumar could not see the said vehicle. He further argued that the accident occurred due to the fault of the respondent No.1 as he parked his vehicle in the middle of the road without any indicator. He further argued that there is no negligence on the part of the deceased Ravinder. 13 On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent No.3-insurance company submitted that the evidence of PW1 Umesh is not reliable as he is relative of the deceased. He also argued that the accident occurred due to the fault of the deceased. He further submitted that the accident occurred due to the contributory negligence of deceased and the drivier of offending vehicle no. HR 55F-9791. 14. PW1 Umesh has clearly deposed the manner in which the accident occurred. As per the challan Ex P1 and site plan Ex.P7, the offending vehicle was parked on the road. In view of the evidence of PW1, there was no indicator or signal and due to reflection of light of other vehicles, deceased could not see the offending vehicle standing on the GT road and his canter struck against the said offending vehicle. As Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 11 such the respondent no.1 who was driver of the vehicle no. HR-55F 9791 was certainly negligent and liable for the accident. But the deceased Ravinder is also equally responsible for the accident and the accident could be avoided if the deceased had been vigilant. In a similar circumstance, Honble Apex Court in the case titled Raj Rani and others vs. Oriental Insurance Co.Ltd. and others 2009(4) PLR 789 held that drivers of both the vehicles were equally negligent . In that case also the truck was parked in the middle of the road without parking lights on and the car driver struck his car against the stationary truck. As such, the authority titled as Raj Rani case (supr a) is fully applicable to the facts of the present case. Therefore, the accident occurred due to the contributory negligence of drivers of the container bearing No. HR 55F-9791 and the deceased Ravinder Kumar. 15. In view of my above discussion, it is held that the accident occurred due to the contributory negligence of the driver of Canter HR 55F-9791 and Ravinder, since deceased, who was driving the vehicle no. HR 67A-0784. As such, the responsibility for causing the accident is in the ratio of 50:50 on respondent No.1 Amrik Dass and Ravinder since deceased. And the petitioners/claimants who are legal heirs of deceased Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 12 Ravinder, are entitled to only 50% of the total amount of loss of dependency. Accordingly, this issue is partly decided in favour of the petitioners. Issue No. 2: 16 This claim petition is in respect of death of Ravinder. In this claim petition, petitioner Urmila when appeared in the witness box as PW2 has testified that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. Ex P1 is the copy of report under section 173 Cr.PC. After going through the entire evidence on the file it is clear that deceased Ravinder died due to the injuries suffered in the accident and as such the petitioners are entitled to get compensation. 17.In the claim petition, it has been submitted that the deceased was earning Rs.25,000/- per month as he was driver and he was doing the work of sale and purchase of vehicles on commission basis. PW3 Rakesh deposed that he is owner of canter no. HR 67A-0784 and deceased Ravinder was a driver under his kind control and supervision on a monthly salary of Rs 15,000/- and also used to do business of sale and purchase of vehicles on commission basis with him and as such he used to earn Rs 10,000/- per month. In order to prove the Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 13 income of deceased the petitioner has not placed on record any document to prove the income of deceased. In the absence of which it cannot be said that deceased Ravinder Kumar was earning Rs 25,000/- per month. The petitioner when appeared as PW2 has told the age of deceased as 25 years. In the Post Mortem report Ex. P2 age of the deceased at the time of accident is mentioned as 26 years. In the driving license Ex.P5 of deceased Ravinder, date of birth of Ravinder is mentioned as 18.9.1990. The petitioners have not placed on record any other document to show the age of deceased. The doctor who conducted the post mortem has mentioned the age of deceased as 26 years. As per Ex P5 driving license of deceased Ravinder, he was approximately 26 years of age at the time of accident. The medical evidence also cannot be discarded. Therefore, for the purpose of assessing compensation, it would be proper to consider the age of the deceased as 26 years at the time of his death. 18. Now, coming to the dependency. Petitioner no.1 is mother deceased and petitioners no.2 and 3 are younger brother and sister of deceased Ravinder. It has been stated by PW1 that they were fully dependent on the income of deceased Ravinder. The evidence adduced Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 14 by the petitioner has gone unrebutted on this point. Petitioner no.1 being mother and petitioners no.2 and 3 being younger brother and sister and the petitioners being legal heirs of deceased are entitled to get compensation for the death of the deceased in the ill-fated accident. 19. The petitioner has not placed on record any document to support the allegations that deceased used to earn Rs. 25,000/- per month. In other words he was a young unmarried man and could have earned sufficient monthly income to maintain his family consisting him i.e . his mother etc. Deceased was working as driver. Therefore, the income of the deceased was certainly more than a male casual labourer. Accordingly, for the purpose of assessing the compensation, the income of deceased is assessed at Rs. 10,000/- per month as he was driver. In view of authority titled as Munna Lal Jain vs Vipin Kumar Sharma 2015(6)SCC 347 and Shri Ram General Insurance Company Limited versus Karnail Kaur and others 2015-4, PLR 324 , the deceased being of 26 years of age at the time of his death, 50% income earned by him is to be added as prospects of future income and considering the age of deceased the total income of the deceased after adding 50% of the income comes to Rs. 15,000/-per month. As the deceased was bachelor, 50% amount Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 15 out of the said income is liable to be deducted towards his personal and living expenses as per the directive of the Hon’ble Supreme Court given in Smt. Sarla Verma v. Delhi Transport Corporation 2009(3) RCR(Civil) 77 . By reducing 50% amount, the dependency deserves to be assessed at Rs.7,500/- per month i.e. Rs.90,000/- per annum. Further in view of latest authorities Munna Lal Jain vs Vipin Kumar Sharma 2015(6) SCC 347 and Shri Ram General Insurance Company Limited vs Karnail Kaur and others 2015-4, PLR 324, Amrit Bhanu Shali vs National Insurance Company Ltd. 2012(11) SCC 738, M. Mansoor vs United India Insurance Co.Ltd. 2013(15) SCC 603 , multiplier is to be applied as per age of the deceased and not as per the age of the dependents, despite the fact that deceased was unmarried/bachelor. 20 Taking into consideration the age of the deceased who was 26 years old at time of accident, the multiplier to be applied is of 17. So, the compensation after applying multiplier of 17 comes to Rs. 90,000 x 17=15,30,000/-. In addition to the compensation awarded above, the claimant will also be entitled to a sum of Rs. 25000/- towards funeral expenses. In total, a compensation of Rs.15,55,000/ - is awarded to the Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 16 petitioners along with interest at the rate of 7.5 per cent per annum to be calculated thereon from the date of filing of the petition till realization . 21. The petitioners being Lrs of deceased and dependent on the income of the deceased are entitled to get compensation of Rs 15,55,000/- for the death of the deceased in the ill-fated accident. As the liability od respondents is only 50% and therefore the petitioners are only entitled to get Rs. 7,77,500/-. Accordingly i ssue no.2 is partly decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUES NO.3 AND 4 : 22. The respondent no.2 has raised the plea that the respondent no. 1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the accident. Perusal of copy of driving licence Ex R1 of respondent no.1 reveals that it was valid for driving the vehicle LMV,NT Transport on the date of the accident. The respondent no.3 has not brought any evidence on record to show the driving licence Ex. R1 was fake or invalid on the date of the accident or that the insured violated any other term or condition of the insurance policy. Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 17 LIABILITY; 22.Now, I advert to deal with the question of liability of the respondents to pay compensation. In the written statement respondent no.3 has not claimed that the vehicle bearing registration no. HR 55F- 9791 was not insured. Ex R2 is legal notice given by Sh. H.C. Jain ld. Counsel for respondent no.3 and after going through the legal notice Ex R2 it is clear that respondent no.3 has not disputed the validity of the insurance policy and by way of legal notice Ex. R2, respondent no.3 asked respondents no.1 and 2 to furnish the permit and fitness certificate. Permit and fitness certificate were tendered by respondents no.1 and 2 vide their statement. Ex. R3 is insurance policy and it appears that inadvertently respondents no.1 and 2 have tendered inusrance policy Ex R3 which was effecive from 17.10.2015 to 16.10.2016. It is admitted fact that accident took place on 28.3.2015. Photocopy of cover note dated 17.10.2014 issued by respondent no.3 is already placed on the file. In these circumstances, it cannot be said that vehicle in question was not insurued with respondent no.3, despite the fact that respondent no.2 inadvertently tendered insurance policy Ex R3. But in view of the fact of cover note placed on the file and in view of the fact that respondent no.3 has not disputed the fact that the vehicle in question was not insured with Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 18 insurance company and in these circumstances, respondent no.3 is liable to make the payment of compensatiion. RELIEF: 23 In view of my findings on the aforesaid issues, the claim petition is allowed in part with costs and a compensation of Rs. 7,77,500/- i.e. 50% amount of the total amount of 15,55,000/- is awarded to the petitioners along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per cent per annum to be calculated thereon from the date of the petition till realization, in equal share. The respondent nos. 1 to 3 are held liable to pay the amount of compensation of Rs 7,77,500/- jointly as well as severally. As the vehicle no. HR 55F -9791 was insured with respondent no.3 Insurance Comp any, as per cover note placed on file, therefore respondent no.3 would be liable to make the payment of amount of compensation. On realization of compensation amount along with interest, 50% of the amount alongwith interest accrued thereupon of the respective shares of petitioner Nos.1 to 3, be paid to them in cash and remaining 50% be deposited in the shape of FDRs in their names in any nationalized bank, fetching maximum interest for a period of three years. It is further directed that the amount of share of minor i.e Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 19 respondent no.3 be deposited in some Nationalized bank till he attained majority. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly and file be consigned to record-room.

Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 3 2.The case of the petitioners, in brief, is that on 28.3.2015 Ravinder, (since deceased) was driving the canter no. HR 67A-0784 and at about 5.00 A.M., when he reached in the area of GT road village Barhi, the offending vehicle canter no. HR 55F-9791 was wrongly parked on the GT road without any signal/indicator to alert the vehicles coming from back side and creating a snag in the way of traffic and due to darkness and light of the vehicles coming from front side, said Ravinder could not see the said wrongly parked vehicle and vehicle of Ravinder hit against the said parked vehicle and accident took place and in the said accident Ravinder sustained grievous injuries on his person and his vehicle went by the side of the road and Ravinder died at the spot due to injuries sustained in the accident. The accident was witnessed by Umesh and on his statement, case FIR No.141 dated 28..3.2015 under section 283 and 304A IPC was registered at police station Ganaur. It has been pleaded that the accident took place due to negligent parking of offending vehicle by respondent no.1. It has been further pleaded that deceased was 25 years of age . The deceased was working as driver and getting salary of rs. 15,000/- per month And used to contribute his whole income for the welfare and maintenance of the claimants. The claimants were fully dependent upon him. It has been pleaded that accident was Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 4 caused by respondent no.1 by driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner without caring the rules of the traffic and respondent no.2 is owner and respondent no.3 is insurer of the offending vehicle. It has been pleaded that the petitioners have suffered great pain, mental torture and agony besides financial loss due to sudden and premature death of Ravinder Kumar. The claimants claim Rs 50.00 lac as compensation on account of death of Ravinder in a Motor Vehicle Act. 3.The respondents no. 1 and 2 filed their joint written statement controverting the claim of the petitioners. It has been pleaded that no accident was caused by the vehicle of answering respondents. The answering respondents have been falsely implicated. A false case has been registered against the answering respondent no.1. The respondent no.1 had a valid driving license. Denying all other averments, prayer for dismissal of the claim petition has been made. 4. In the written statement filed by respondent no.3, certain preliminary objections regarding maintainability etc were taken. It was pleaded that no accident ever took place with vehicle bearing registration no. HR 55F-9791. But accident took place due to rash and Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 5 negligent driving of deceased himself. It has been pleaded that deceased also contributed to the cause of the alleged accident. The respondent no.1 never informed the answering respondent about the accident if any. It was submitted that respondent No.1 was not holding any driving licence, etc at the time of the accident and as such insurance company is not liable to indemnify the insured. The entire story mentioned in the FIR and claim petitions is the creation of claimants in collusion with the police in order to extract the amount of compensation. The FIR was registered on the statement of cousin of deceased, who had not witnessed the accident. All the documents have also been prepared falsely. The Insurance company is thus not liable to indemnify the insured as respondent No.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. Insurance company also denied the personal particulars of the deceased with regard to his income, age etc. The amount claimed by the petitioners is excessive and exorbitant and has no relevancy to the alleged loss. Rest of the contentions were denied and prayer for dismissal of the petition has been made. 5. On the pleadings of the parties following issues were framed : Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 6 1.Whether the accident in question resulting into the death of Ravinder son of Shri Chandan Sahini had occurred on account of Motor Vehicular accident dated 28.3.2015 at about 5.00.A.M in the area of village Barhi GT Road, Sonepat by respondent no.1 on account of rash and negligent and wrong parking of offending vehicle container bearing registration no. HR 55 F-9791?OPP. 2.If issue no.1 is decided in favour of the claimants, whether the claimants are entitled to claim amount as claimed in the claim petition and from whom ? OPP. 3.Whether the petition is not maintainable in the present form?OPR 4.Whether insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation? OPR3. 5. Relief. 6.In the evidence of the petitioners. Petitioner Urmila herself appeared as PW2 and e xamined, Umesh eye witness of the alleged accident as PW2, Rakesh Kumar as PW3, besides producing the following documents: Ex.P1 :Copy of report u/s173 Cr.PC Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 7 Ex P2 :Post mortem report Ex.P3 :Copy of Ration card Ex P4 :Copy of RC Ex P5 :DL of Ravinder Ex P6 :Copy of superdari order Ex P7 :Site plan Ex P8 : Copy of RC of vehicle of respondent no.1 Ex P9 :DL of respondent no.1 7. On the other hand, no evidence has been led on behalf of the respondents. The respondents have tendered documents Ex R1 to R8. 8.I have appraised the evidence on record, the material circumstances of the case and heard the arguments addressed by the learned counsel for the parties. My findings on the aforesaid issues are as under: Issue No.1 : 9.In order to prove this issue, petitioner has stepped into the witness box as PW2 and tendered her affidavit Ex. PW2/A reiterating the Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 8 facts as mentioned in the petition and deposed that the accident took place due to rash and negligent parking on the part of the respondent no.1 and due to said accident, her son died. They suffered financial loss and mental agony. She deposed that her son was 25 years of age. He was earning Rs.25,000/- per month as he was driver and used to contribute his all income for the welfare and maintenance of claimants and they were dependent upon the income of deceased. 10.PW1 Umesh, who is eye witness of the accident has corroborated the version of PW2 and stated that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent parking of offending vehicle by respondent no.1. He further deposed that at the time of accident he was following the deceased in another vehicle and at about 5.00A.M when their vehicle reached in the area of GT Road Barhi, many vehicles were coming from front side on another side of GT road and their lights were bowing on their side . He further deposed that canter no. HR 55F-9791 was wrongly parked on the GT road without any indicator to warn the vehicles coming from behind and said Ravinder could not see the said parked vehicle and his vehicle hit against the wrongly parked vehicle and accident took place and Ravinder sustained injuries and died at the spot. FIR No. 141 dated Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 9 28.3.2015 under section 283 and 304A IPC was registered against respondent no.1.on his statement. There is no ground to disbelieve the evidence of PW1 Umesh particularly when the FIR Ex.P1 was registered within few hours of the accident against the driver of vehicle no. HR-55F 9791 for parking the said vehicle in the middle of the road resulting inti accident in which Ravinder lost his life. 11. It is the case of the petitioners that on 28.3.2015 deceased Ravinder was going towards Panipat. At about 5.00.A.M when he reached near village Barhi at GT road the offending vehicle bearing registration no. HR 55F-9791 was wrongly parked without any indicator and due to darkness, deceased Ravinder could not see the offending vehicle and his vehicle struck against the offending vehicle on back side and accident took place, due to which Ravinder died at the spot. This evidence is supported by report under section 173 Cr.PC Ex P1 and post mortem report Ex P2 as well as statement of PW1 Umesh eye witness of the alleged accident. 12.The learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the accident took place during night time and there was no indicator or signal Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 10 and as the offending vehicle was standing in the middle of the road and due to that reason, deceased Ravinder Kumar could not see the said vehicle. He further argued that the accident occurred due to the fault of the respondent No.1 as he parked his vehicle in the middle of the road without any indicator. He further argued that there is no negligence on the part of the deceased Ravinder. 13 On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent No.3-insurance company submitted that the evidence of PW1 Umesh is not reliable as he is relative of the deceased. He also argued that the accident occurred due to the fault of the deceased. He further submitted that the accident occurred due to the contributory negligence of deceased and the drivier of offending vehicle no. HR 55F-9791. 14. PW1 Umesh has clearly deposed the manner in which the accident occurred. As per the challan Ex P1 and site plan Ex.P7, the offending vehicle was parked on the road. In view of the evidence of PW1, there was no indicator or signal and due to reflection of light of other vehicles, deceased could not see the offending vehicle standing on the GT road and his canter struck against the said offending vehicle. As Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 11 such the respondent no.1 who was driver of the vehicle no. HR-55F 9791 was certainly negligent and liable for the accident. But the deceased Ravinder is also equally responsible for the accident and the accident could be avoided if the deceased had been vigilant. In a similar circumstance, Honble Apex Court in the case titled Raj Rani and others vs. Oriental Insurance Co.Ltd. and others 2009(4) PLR 789 held that drivers of both the vehicles were equally negligent . In that case also the truck was parked in the middle of the road without parking lights on and the car driver struck his car against the stationary truck. As such, the authority titled as Raj Rani case (supr a) is fully applicable to the facts of the present case. Therefore, the accident occurred due to the contributory negligence of drivers of the container bearing No. HR 55F-9791 and the deceased Ravinder Kumar. 15. In view of my above discussion, it is held that the accident occurred due to the contributory negligence of the driver of Canter HR 55F-9791 and Ravinder, since deceased, who was driving the vehicle no. HR 67A-0784. As such, the responsibility for causing the accident is in the ratio of 50:50 on respondent No.1 Amrik Dass and Ravinder since deceased. And the petitioners/claimants who are legal heirs of deceased Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 12 Ravinder, are entitled to only 50% of the total amount of loss of dependency. Accordingly, this issue is partly decided in favour of the petitioners. Issue No. 2: 16 This claim petition is in respect of death of Ravinder. In this claim petition, petitioner Urmila when appeared in the witness box as PW2 has testified that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. Ex P1 is the copy of report under section 173 Cr.PC. After going through the entire evidence on the file it is clear that deceased Ravinder died due to the injuries suffered in the accident and as such the petitioners are entitled to get compensation. 17.In the claim petition, it has been submitted that the deceased was earning Rs.25,000/- per month as he was driver and he was doing the work of sale and purchase of vehicles on commission basis. PW3 Rakesh deposed that he is owner of canter no. HR 67A-0784 and deceased Ravinder was a driver under his kind control and supervision on a monthly salary of Rs 15,000/- and also used to do business of sale and purchase of vehicles on commission basis with him and as such he used to earn Rs 10,000/- per month. In order to prove the Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 13 income of deceased the petitioner has not placed on record any document to prove the income of deceased. In the absence of which it cannot be said that deceased Ravinder Kumar was earning Rs 25,000/- per month. The petitioner when appeared as PW2 has told the age of deceased as 25 years. In the Post Mortem report Ex. P2 age of the deceased at the time of accident is mentioned as 26 years. In the driving license Ex.P5 of deceased Ravinder, date of birth of Ravinder is mentioned as 18.9.1990. The petitioners have not placed on record any other document to show the age of deceased. The doctor who conducted the post mortem has mentioned the age of deceased as 26 years. As per Ex P5 driving license of deceased Ravinder, he was approximately 26 years of age at the time of accident. The medical evidence also cannot be discarded. Therefore, for the purpose of assessing compensation, it would be proper to consider the age of the deceased as 26 years at the time of his death. 18. Now, coming to the dependency. Petitioner no.1 is mother deceased and petitioners no.2 and 3 are younger brother and sister of deceased Ravinder. It has been stated by PW1 that they were fully dependent on the income of deceased Ravinder. The evidence adduced Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 14 by the petitioner has gone unrebutted on this point. Petitioner no.1 being mother and petitioners no.2 and 3 being younger brother and sister and the petitioners being legal heirs of deceased are entitled to get compensation for the death of the deceased in the ill-fated accident. 19. The petitioner has not placed on record any document to support the allegations that deceased used to earn Rs. 25,000/- per month. In other words he was a young unmarried man and could have earned sufficient monthly income to maintain his family consisting him i.e . his mother etc. Deceased was working as driver. Therefore, the income of the deceased was certainly more than a male casual labourer. Accordingly, for the purpose of assessing the compensation, the income of deceased is assessed at Rs. 10,000/- per month as he was driver. In view of authority titled as Munna Lal Jain vs Vipin Kumar Sharma 2015(6)SCC 347 and Shri Ram General Insurance Company Limited versus Karnail Kaur and others 2015-4, PLR 324 , the deceased being of 26 years of age at the time of his death, 50% income earned by him is to be added as prospects of future income and considering the age of deceased the total income of the deceased after adding 50% of the income comes to Rs. 15,000/-per month. As the deceased was bachelor, 50% amount Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 15 out of the said income is liable to be deducted towards his personal and living expenses as per the directive of the Hon’ble Supreme Court given in Smt. Sarla Verma v. Delhi Transport Corporation 2009(3) RCR(Civil) 77 . By reducing 50% amount, the dependency deserves to be assessed at Rs.7,500/- per month i.e. Rs.90,000/- per annum. Further in view of latest authorities Munna Lal Jain vs Vipin Kumar Sharma 2015(6) SCC 347 and Shri Ram General Insurance Company Limited vs Karnail Kaur and others 2015-4, PLR 324, Amrit Bhanu Shali vs National Insurance Company Ltd. 2012(11) SCC 738, M. Mansoor vs United India Insurance Co.Ltd. 2013(15) SCC 603 , multiplier is to be applied as per age of the deceased and not as per the age of the dependents, despite the fact that deceased was unmarried/bachelor. 20 Taking into consideration the age of the deceased who was 26 years old at time of accident, the multiplier to be applied is of 17. So, the compensation after applying multiplier of 17 comes to Rs. 90,000 x 17=15,30,000/-. In addition to the compensation awarded above, the claimant will also be entitled to a sum of Rs. 25000/- towards funeral expenses. In total, a compensation of Rs.15,55,000/ - is awarded to the Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 16 petitioners along with interest at the rate of 7.5 per cent per annum to be calculated thereon from the date of filing of the petition till realization . 21. The petitioners being Lrs of deceased and dependent on the income of the deceased are entitled to get compensation of Rs 15,55,000/- for the death of the deceased in the ill-fated accident. As the liability od respondents is only 50% and therefore the petitioners are only entitled to get Rs. 7,77,500/-. Accordingly i ssue no.2 is partly decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUES NO.3 AND 4 : 22. The respondent no.2 has raised the plea that the respondent no. 1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the accident. Perusal of copy of driving licence Ex R1 of respondent no.1 reveals that it was valid for driving the vehicle LMV,NT Transport on the date of the accident. The respondent no.3 has not brought any evidence on record to show the driving licence Ex. R1 was fake or invalid on the date of the accident or that the insured violated any other term or condition of the insurance policy. Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 17 LIABILITY; 22.Now, I advert to deal with the question of liability of the respondents to pay compensation. In the written statement respondent no.3 has not claimed that the vehicle bearing registration no. HR 55F- 9791 was not insured. Ex R2 is legal notice given by Sh. H.C. Jain ld. Counsel for respondent no.3 and after going through the legal notice Ex R2 it is clear that respondent no.3 has not disputed the validity of the insurance policy and by way of legal notice Ex. R2, respondent no.3 asked respondents no.1 and 2 to furnish the permit and fitness certificate. Permit and fitness certificate were tendered by respondents no.1 and 2 vide their statement. Ex. R3 is insurance policy and it appears that inadvertently respondents no.1 and 2 have tendered inusrance policy Ex R3 which was effecive from 17.10.2015 to 16.10.2016. It is admitted fact that accident took place on 28.3.2015. Photocopy of cover note dated 17.10.2014 issued by respondent no.3 is already placed on the file. In these circumstances, it cannot be said that vehicle in question was not insurued with respondent no.3, despite the fact that respondent no.2 inadvertently tendered insurance policy Ex R3. But in view of the fact of cover note placed on the file and in view of the fact that respondent no.3 has not disputed the fact that the vehicle in question was not insured with Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 18 insurance company and in these circumstances, respondent no.3 is liable to make the payment of compensatiion. RELIEF: 23 In view of my findings on the aforesaid issues, the claim petition is allowed in part with costs and a compensation of Rs. 7,77,500/- i.e. 50% amount of the total amount of 15,55,000/- is awarded to the petitioners along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per cent per annum to be calculated thereon from the date of the petition till realization, in equal share. The respondent nos. 1 to 3 are held liable to pay the amount of compensation of Rs 7,77,500/- jointly as well as severally. As the vehicle no. HR 55F -9791 was insured with respondent no.3 Insurance Comp any, as per cover note placed on file, therefore respondent no.3 would be liable to make the payment of amount of compensation. On realization of compensation amount along with interest, 50% of the amount alongwith interest accrued thereupon of the respective shares of petitioner Nos.1 to 3, be paid to them in cash and remaining 50% be deposited in the shape of FDRs in their names in any nationalized bank, fetching maximum interest for a period of three years. It is further directed that the amount of share of minor i.e Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 19 respondent no.3 be deposited in some Nationalized bank till he attained majority. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly and file be consigned to record-room.

There is no ground to disbelieve the evidence of PW1 Umesh particularly when the FIR Ex.P1 was registered within few hours of the accident against the driver of vehicle no. HR-55F 9791 for parking the said vehicle in the middle of the road resulting inti accident in which Ravinder lost his life. 11. It is the case of the petitioners that on 28.3.2015 deceased Ravinder was going towards Panipat. At about 5.00.A.M when he reached near village Barhi at GT road the offending vehicle bearing registration no. HR 55F-9791 was wrongly parked without any indicator and due to darkness, deceased Ravinder could not see the offending vehicle and his vehicle struck against the offending vehicle on back side and accident took place, due to which Ravinder died at the spot. This evidence is supported by report under section 173 Cr.PC Ex P1 and post mortem report Ex P2 as well as statement of PW1 Umesh eye witness of the alleged accident. 12.The learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the accident took place during night time and there was no indicator or signal Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 10 and as the offending vehicle was standing in the middle of the road and due to that reason, deceased Ravinder Kumar could not see the said vehicle. He further argued that the accident occurred due to the fault of the respondent No.1 as he parked his vehicle in the middle of the road without any indicator. He further argued that there is no negligence on the part of the deceased Ravinder. 13 On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent No.3-insurance company submitted that the evidence of PW1 Umesh is not reliable as he is relative of the deceased. He also argued that the accident occurred due to the fault of the deceased. He further submitted that the accident occurred due to the contributory negligence of deceased and the drivier of offending vehicle no. HR 55F-9791. 14. PW1 Umesh has clearly deposed the manner in which the accident occurred. As per the challan Ex P1 and site plan Ex.P7, the offending vehicle was parked on the road. In view of the evidence of PW1, there was no indicator or signal and due to reflection of light of other vehicles, deceased could not see the offending vehicle standing on the GT road and his canter struck against the said offending vehicle. As Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 11 such the respondent no.1 who was driver of the vehicle no. HR-55F 9791 was certainly negligent and liable for the accident. But the deceased Ravinder is also equally responsible for the accident and the accident could be avoided if the deceased had been vigilant. In a similar circumstance, Honble Apex Court in the case titled Raj Rani and others vs. Oriental Insurance Co.Ltd. and others 2009(4) PLR 789 held that drivers of both the vehicles were equally negligent . In that case also the truck was parked in the middle of the road without parking lights on and the car driver struck his car against the stationary truck. As such, the authority titled as Raj Rani case (supr a) is fully applicable to the facts of the present case. Therefore, the accident occurred due to the contributory negligence of drivers of the container bearing No. HR 55F-9791 and the deceased Ravinder Kumar. 15. In view of my above discussion, it is held that the accident occurred due to the contributory negligence of the driver of Canter HR 55F-9791 and Ravinder, since deceased, who was driving the vehicle no. HR 67A-0784. As such, the responsibility for causing the accident is in the ratio of 50:50 on respondent No.1 Amrik Dass and Ravinder since deceased. And the petitioners/claimants who are legal heirs of deceased Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 12 Ravinder, are entitled to only 50% of the total amount of loss of dependency. Accordingly, this issue is partly decided in favour of the petitioners. Issue No. 2: 16 This claim petition is in respect of death of Ravinder. In this claim petition, petitioner Urmila when appeared in the witness box as PW2 has testified that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. Ex P1 is the copy of report under section 173 Cr.PC. After going through the entire evidence on the file it is clear that deceased Ravinder died due to the injuries suffered in the accident and as such the petitioners are entitled to get compensation. 17.In the claim petition, it has been submitted that the deceased was earning Rs.25,000/- per month as he was driver and he was doing the work of sale and purchase of vehicles on commission basis. PW3 Rakesh deposed that he is owner of canter no. HR 67A-0784 and deceased Ravinder was a driver under his kind control and supervision on a monthly salary of Rs 15,000/- and also used to do business of sale and purchase of vehicles on commission basis with him and as such he used to earn Rs 10,000/- per month. In order to prove the Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 13 income of deceased the petitioner has not placed on record any document to prove the income of deceased. In the absence of which it cannot be said that deceased Ravinder Kumar was earning Rs 25,000/- per month. The petitioner when appeared as PW2 has told the age of deceased as 25 years. In the Post Mortem report Ex. P2 age of the deceased at the time of accident is mentioned as 26 years. In the driving license Ex.P5 of deceased Ravinder, date of birth of Ravinder is mentioned as 18.9.1990. The petitioners have not placed on record any other document to show the age of deceased. The doctor who conducted the post mortem has mentioned the age of deceased as 26 years. As per Ex P5 driving license of deceased Ravinder, he was approximately 26 years of age at the time of accident. The medical evidence also cannot be discarded. Therefore, for the purpose of assessing compensation, it would be proper to consider the age of the deceased as 26 years at the time of his death. 18. Now, coming to the dependency. Petitioner no.1 is mother deceased and petitioners no.2 and 3 are younger brother and sister of deceased Ravinder. It has been stated by PW1 that they were fully dependent on the income of deceased Ravinder. The evidence adduced Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 14 by the petitioner has gone unrebutted on this point. Petitioner no.1 being mother and petitioners no.2 and 3 being younger brother and sister and the petitioners being legal heirs of deceased are entitled to get compensation for the death of the deceased in the ill-fated accident. 19. The petitioner has not placed on record any document to support the allegations that deceased used to earn Rs. 25,000/- per month. In other words he was a young unmarried man and could have earned sufficient monthly income to maintain his family consisting him i.e . his mother etc. Deceased was working as driver. Therefore, the income of the deceased was certainly more than a male casual labourer. Accordingly, for the purpose of assessing the compensation, the income of deceased is assessed at Rs. 10,000/- per month as he was driver. In view of authority titled as Munna Lal Jain vs Vipin Kumar Sharma 2015(6)SCC 347 and Shri Ram General Insurance Company Limited versus Karnail Kaur and others 2015-4, PLR 324 , the deceased being of 26 years of age at the time of his death, 50% income earned by him is to be added as prospects of future income and considering the age of deceased the total income of the deceased after adding 50% of the income comes to Rs. 15,000/-per month. As the deceased was bachelor, 50% amount Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 15 out of the said income is liable to be deducted towards his personal and living expenses as per the directive of the Hon’ble Supreme Court given in Smt. Sarla Verma v. Delhi Transport Corporation 2009(3) RCR(Civil) 77 . By reducing 50% amount, the dependency deserves to be assessed at Rs.7,500/- per month i.e. Rs.90,000/- per annum. Further in view of latest authorities Munna Lal Jain vs Vipin Kumar Sharma 2015(6) SCC 347 and Shri Ram General Insurance Company Limited vs Karnail Kaur and others 2015-4, PLR 324, Amrit Bhanu Shali vs National Insurance Company Ltd. 2012(11) SCC 738, M. Mansoor vs United India Insurance Co.Ltd. 2013(15) SCC 603 , multiplier is to be applied as per age of the deceased and not as per the age of the dependents, despite the fact that deceased was unmarried/bachelor. 20 Taking into consideration the age of the deceased who was 26 years old at time of accident, the multiplier to be applied is of 17. So, the compensation after applying multiplier of 17 comes to Rs. 90,000 x 17=15,30,000/-. In addition to the compensation awarded above, the claimant will also be entitled to a sum of Rs. 25000/- towards funeral expenses. In total, a compensation of Rs.15,55,000/ - is awarded to the Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 16 petitioners along with interest at the rate of 7.5 per cent per annum to be calculated thereon from the date of filing of the petition till realization . 21. The petitioners being Lrs of deceased and dependent on the income of the deceased are entitled to get compensation of Rs 15,55,000/- for the death of the deceased in the ill-fated accident. As the liability od respondents is only 50% and therefore the petitioners are only entitled to get Rs. 7,77,500/-. Accordingly i ssue no.2 is partly decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUES NO.3 AND 4 : 22. The respondent no.2 has raised the plea that the respondent no. 1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the accident. Perusal of copy of driving licence Ex R1 of respondent no.1 reveals that it was valid for driving the vehicle LMV,NT Transport on the date of the accident. The respondent no.3 has not brought any evidence on record to show the driving licence Ex. R1 was fake or invalid on the date of the accident or that the insured violated any other term or condition of the insurance policy. Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 17 LIABILITY; 22.Now, I advert to deal with the question of liability of the respondents to pay compensation. In the written statement respondent no.3 has not claimed that the vehicle bearing registration no. HR 55F- 9791 was not insured. Ex R2 is legal notice given by Sh. H.C. Jain ld. Counsel for respondent no.3 and after going through the legal notice Ex R2 it is clear that respondent no.3 has not disputed the validity of the insurance policy and by way of legal notice Ex. R2, respondent no.3 asked respondents no.1 and 2 to furnish the permit and fitness certificate. Permit and fitness certificate were tendered by respondents no.1 and 2 vide their statement. Ex. R3 is insurance policy and it appears that inadvertently respondents no.1 and 2 have tendered inusrance policy Ex R3 which was effecive from 17.10.2015 to 16.10.2016. It is admitted fact that accident took place on 28.3.2015. Photocopy of cover note dated 17.10.2014 issued by respondent no.3 is already placed on the file. In these circumstances, it cannot be said that vehicle in question was not insurued with respondent no.3, despite the fact that respondent no.2 inadvertently tendered insurance policy Ex R3. But in view of the fact of cover note placed on the file and in view of the fact that respondent no.3 has not disputed the fact that the vehicle in question was not insured with Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 18 insurance company and in these circumstances, respondent no.3 is liable to make the payment of compensatiion. RELIEF: 23 In view of my findings on the aforesaid issues, the claim petition is allowed in part with costs and a compensation of Rs. 7,77,500/- i.e. 50% amount of the total amount of 15,55,000/- is awarded to the petitioners along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per cent per annum to be calculated thereon from the date of the petition till realization, in equal share. The respondent nos. 1 to 3 are held liable to pay the amount of compensation of Rs 7,77,500/- jointly as well as severally. As the vehicle no. HR 55F -9791 was insured with respondent no.3 Insurance Comp any, as per cover note placed on file, therefore respondent no.3 would be liable to make the payment of amount of compensation. On realization of compensation amount along with interest, 50% of the amount alongwith interest accrued thereupon of the respective shares of petitioner Nos.1 to 3, be paid to them in cash and remaining 50% be deposited in the shape of FDRs in their names in any nationalized bank, fetching maximum interest for a period of three years. It is further directed that the amount of share of minor i.e Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 19 respondent no.3 be deposited in some Nationalized bank till he attained majority.

Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 3 2.The case of the petitioners, in brief, is that on 28.3.2015 Ravinder, (since deceased) was driving the canter no. HR 67A-0784 and at about 5.00 A.M., when he reached in the area of GT road village Barhi, the offending vehicle canter no. HR 55F-9791 was wrongly parked on the GT road without any signal/indicator to alert the vehicles coming from back side and creating a snag in the way of traffic and due to darkness and light of the vehicles coming from front side, said Ravinder could not see the said wrongly parked vehicle and vehicle of Ravinder hit against the said parked vehicle and accident took place and in the said accident Ravinder sustained grievous injuries on his person and his vehicle went by the side of the road and Ravinder died at the spot due to injuries sustained in the accident. The accident was witnessed by Umesh and on his statement, case FIR No.141 dated 28..3.2015 under section 283 and 304A IPC was registered at police station Ganaur. It has been pleaded that the accident took place due to negligent parking of offending vehicle by respondent no.1. It has been further pleaded that deceased was 25 years of age . The deceased was working as driver and getting salary of rs. 15,000/- per month And used to contribute his whole income for the welfare and maintenance of the claimants. The claimants were fully dependent upon him. It has been pleaded that accident was Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 4 caused by respondent no.1 by driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner without caring the rules of the traffic and respondent no.2 is owner and respondent no.3 is insurer of the offending vehicle. It has been pleaded that the petitioners have suffered great pain, mental torture and agony besides financial loss due to sudden and premature death of Ravinder Kumar. The claimants claim Rs 50.00 lac as compensation on account of death of Ravinder in a Motor Vehicle Act. 3.The respondents no. 1 and 2 filed their joint written statement controverting the claim of the petitioners. It has been pleaded that no accident was caused by the vehicle of answering respondents. The answering respondents have been falsely implicated. A false case has been registered against the answering respondent no.1. The respondent no.1 had a valid driving license. Denying all other averments, prayer for dismissal of the claim petition has been made. 4. In the written statement filed by respondent no.3, certain preliminary objections regarding maintainability etc were taken. It was pleaded that no accident ever took place with vehicle bearing registration no. HR 55F-9791. But accident took place due to rash and Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 5 negligent driving of deceased himself. It has been pleaded that deceased also contributed to the cause of the alleged accident. The respondent no.1 never informed the answering respondent about the accident if any. It was submitted that respondent No.1 was not holding any driving licence, etc at the time of the accident and as such insurance company is not liable to indemnify the insured. The entire story mentioned in the FIR and claim petitions is the creation of claimants in collusion with the police in order to extract the amount of compensation. The FIR was registered on the statement of cousin of deceased, who had not witnessed the accident. All the documents have also been prepared falsely. The Insurance company is thus not liable to indemnify the insured as respondent No.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. Insurance company also denied the personal particulars of the deceased with regard to his income, age etc. The amount claimed by the petitioners is excessive and exorbitant and has no relevancy to the alleged loss. Rest of the contentions were denied and prayer for dismissal of the petition has been made. 5. On the pleadings of the parties following issues were framed : Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 6 1.Whether the accident in question resulting into the death of Ravinder son of Shri Chandan Sahini had occurred on account of Motor Vehicular accident dated 28.3.2015 at about 5.00.A.M in the area of village Barhi GT Road, Sonepat by respondent no.1 on account of rash and negligent and wrong parking of offending vehicle container bearing registration no. HR 55 F-9791?OPP. 2.If issue no.1 is decided in favour of the claimants, whether the claimants are entitled to claim amount as claimed in the claim petition and from whom ? OPP. 3.Whether the petition is not maintainable in the present form?OPR 4.Whether insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation? OPR3. 5. Relief. 6.In the evidence of the petitioners. Petitioner Urmila herself appeared as PW2 and e xamined, Umesh eye witness of the alleged accident as PW2, Rakesh Kumar as PW3, besides producing the following documents: Ex.P1 :Copy of report u/s173 Cr.PC Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 7 Ex P2 :Post mortem report Ex.P3 :Copy of Ration card Ex P4 :Copy of RC Ex P5 :DL of Ravinder Ex P6 :Copy of superdari order Ex P7 :Site plan Ex P8 : Copy of RC of vehicle of respondent no.1 Ex P9 :DL of respondent no.1 7. On the other hand, no evidence has been led on behalf of the respondents. The respondents have tendered documents Ex R1 to R8. 8.I have appraised the evidence on record, the material circumstances of the case and heard the arguments addressed by the learned counsel for the parties. My findings on the aforesaid issues are as under: Issue No.1 : 9.In order to prove this issue, petitioner has stepped into the witness box as PW2 and tendered her affidavit Ex. PW2/A reiterating the Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 8 facts as mentioned in the petition and deposed that the accident took place due to rash and negligent parking on the part of the respondent no.1 and due to said accident, her son died. They suffered financial loss and mental agony. She deposed that her son was 25 years of age. He was earning Rs.25,000/- per month as he was driver and used to contribute his all income for the welfare and maintenance of claimants and they were dependent upon the income of deceased. 10.PW1 Umesh, who is eye witness of the accident has corroborated the version of PW2 and stated that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent parking of offending vehicle by respondent no.1. He further deposed that at the time of accident he was following the deceased in another vehicle and at about 5.00A.M when their vehicle reached in the area of GT Road Barhi, many vehicles were coming from front side on another side of GT road and their lights were bowing on their side . He further deposed that canter no. HR 55F-9791 was wrongly parked on the GT road without any indicator to warn the vehicles coming from behind and said Ravinder could not see the said parked vehicle and his vehicle hit against the wrongly parked vehicle and accident took place and Ravinder sustained injuries and died at the spot. FIR No. 141 dated Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 9 28.3.2015 under section 283 and 304A IPC was registered against respondent no.1.on his statement. There is no ground to disbelieve the evidence of PW1 Umesh particularly when the FIR Ex.P1 was registered within few hours of the accident against the driver of vehicle no. HR-55F 9791 for parking the said vehicle in the middle of the road resulting inti accident in which Ravinder lost his life. 11. It is the case of the petitioners that on 28.3.2015 deceased Ravinder was going towards Panipat. At about 5.00.A.M when he reached near village Barhi at GT road the offending vehicle bearing registration no. HR 55F-9791 was wrongly parked without any indicator and due to darkness, deceased Ravinder could not see the offending vehicle and his vehicle struck against the offending vehicle on back side and accident took place, due to which Ravinder died at the spot. This evidence is supported by report under section 173 Cr.PC Ex P1 and post mortem report Ex P2 as well as statement of PW1 Umesh eye witness of the alleged accident. 12.The learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the accident took place during night time and there was no indicator or signal Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 10 and as the offending vehicle was standing in the middle of the road and due to that reason, deceased Ravinder Kumar could not see the said vehicle. He further argued that the accident occurred due to the fault of the respondent No.1 as he parked his vehicle in the middle of the road without any indicator. He further argued that there is no negligence on the part of the deceased Ravinder. 13 On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondent No.3-insurance company submitted that the evidence of PW1 Umesh is not reliable as he is relative of the deceased. He also argued that the accident occurred due to the fault of the deceased. He further submitted that the accident occurred due to the contributory negligence of deceased and the drivier of offending vehicle no. HR 55F-9791. 14. PW1 Umesh has clearly deposed the manner in which the accident occurred. As per the challan Ex P1 and site plan Ex.P7, the offending vehicle was parked on the road. In view of the evidence of PW1, there was no indicator or signal and due to reflection of light of other vehicles, deceased could not see the offending vehicle standing on the GT road and his canter struck against the said offending vehicle. As Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 11 such the respondent no.1 who was driver of the vehicle no. HR-55F 9791 was certainly negligent and liable for the accident. But the deceased Ravinder is also equally responsible for the accident and the accident could be avoided if the deceased had been vigilant. In a similar circumstance, Honble Apex Court in the case titled Raj Rani and others vs. Oriental Insurance Co.Ltd. and others 2009(4) PLR 789 held that drivers of both the vehicles were equally negligent . In that case also the truck was parked in the middle of the road without parking lights on and the car driver struck his car against the stationary truck. As such, the authority titled as Raj Rani case (supr a) is fully applicable to the facts of the present case. Therefore, the accident occurred due to the contributory negligence of drivers of the container bearing No. HR 55F-9791 and the deceased Ravinder Kumar. 15. In view of my above discussion, it is held that the accident occurred due to the contributory negligence of the driver of Canter HR 55F-9791 and Ravinder, since deceased, who was driving the vehicle no. HR 67A-0784. As such, the responsibility for causing the accident is in the ratio of 50:50 on respondent No.1 Amrik Dass and Ravinder since deceased. And the petitioners/claimants who are legal heirs of deceased Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 12 Ravinder, are entitled to only 50% of the total amount of loss of dependency. Accordingly, this issue is partly decided in favour of the petitioners. Issue No. 2: 16 This claim petition is in respect of death of Ravinder. In this claim petition, petitioner Urmila when appeared in the witness box as PW2 has testified that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. Ex P1 is the copy of report under section 173 Cr.PC. After going through the entire evidence on the file it is clear that deceased Ravinder died due to the injuries suffered in the accident and as such the petitioners are entitled to get compensation. 17.In the claim petition, it has been submitted that the deceased was earning Rs.25,000/- per month as he was driver and he was doing the work of sale and purchase of vehicles on commission basis. PW3 Rakesh deposed that he is owner of canter no. HR 67A-0784 and deceased Ravinder was a driver under his kind control and supervision on a monthly salary of Rs 15,000/- and also used to do business of sale and purchase of vehicles on commission basis with him and as such he used to earn Rs 10,000/- per month. In order to prove the Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 13 income of deceased the petitioner has not placed on record any document to prove the income of deceased. In the absence of which it cannot be said that deceased Ravinder Kumar was earning Rs 25,000/- per month. The petitioner when appeared as PW2 has told the age of deceased as 25 years. In the Post Mortem report Ex. P2 age of the deceased at the time of accident is mentioned as 26 years. In the driving license Ex.P5 of deceased Ravinder, date of birth of Ravinder is mentioned as 18.9.1990. The petitioners have not placed on record any other document to show the age of deceased. The doctor who conducted the post mortem has mentioned the age of deceased as 26 years. As per Ex P5 driving license of deceased Ravinder, he was approximately 26 years of age at the time of accident. The medical evidence also cannot be discarded. Therefore, for the purpose of assessing compensation, it would be proper to consider the age of the deceased as 26 years at the time of his death. 18. Now, coming to the dependency. Petitioner no.1 is mother deceased and petitioners no.2 and 3 are younger brother and sister of deceased Ravinder. It has been stated by PW1 that they were fully dependent on the income of deceased Ravinder. The evidence adduced Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 14 by the petitioner has gone unrebutted on this point. Petitioner no.1 being mother and petitioners no.2 and 3 being younger brother and sister and the petitioners being legal heirs of deceased are entitled to get compensation for the death of the deceased in the ill-fated accident. 19. The petitioner has not placed on record any document to support the allegations that deceased used to earn Rs. 25,000/- per month. In other words he was a young unmarried man and could have earned sufficient monthly income to maintain his family consisting him i.e . his mother etc. Deceased was working as driver. Therefore, the income of the deceased was certainly more than a male casual labourer. Accordingly, for the purpose of assessing the compensation, the income of deceased is assessed at Rs. 10,000/- per month as he was driver. In view of authority titled as Munna Lal Jain vs Vipin Kumar Sharma 2015(6)SCC 347 and Shri Ram General Insurance Company Limited versus Karnail Kaur and others 2015-4, PLR 324 , the deceased being of 26 years of age at the time of his death, 50% income earned by him is to be added as prospects of future income and considering the age of deceased the total income of the deceased after adding 50% of the income comes to Rs. 15,000/-per month. As the deceased was bachelor, 50% amount Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 15 out of the said income is liable to be deducted towards his personal and living expenses as per the directive of the Hon’ble Supreme Court given in Smt. Sarla Verma v. Delhi Transport Corporation 2009(3) RCR(Civil) 77 . By reducing 50% amount, the dependency deserves to be assessed at Rs.7,500/- per month i.e. Rs.90,000/- per annum. Further in view of latest authorities Munna Lal Jain vs Vipin Kumar Sharma 2015(6) SCC 347 and Shri Ram General Insurance Company Limited vs Karnail Kaur and others 2015-4, PLR 324, Amrit Bhanu Shali vs National Insurance Company Ltd. 2012(11) SCC 738, M. Mansoor vs United India Insurance Co.Ltd. 2013(15) SCC 603 , multiplier is to be applied as per age of the deceased and not as per the age of the dependents, despite the fact that deceased was unmarried/bachelor. 20 Taking into consideration the age of the deceased who was 26 years old at time of accident, the multiplier to be applied is of 17. So, the compensation after applying multiplier of 17 comes to Rs. 90,000 x 17=15,30,000/-. In addition to the compensation awarded above, the claimant will also be entitled to a sum of Rs. 25000/- towards funeral expenses. In total, a compensation of Rs.15,55,000/ - is awarded to the Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 16 petitioners along with interest at the rate of 7.5 per cent per annum to be calculated thereon from the date of filing of the petition till realization . 21. The petitioners being Lrs of deceased and dependent on the income of the deceased are entitled to get compensation of Rs 15,55,000/- for the death of the deceased in the ill-fated accident. As the liability od respondents is only 50% and therefore the petitioners are only entitled to get Rs. 7,77,500/-. Accordingly i ssue no.2 is partly decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUES NO.3 AND 4 : 22. The respondent no.2 has raised the plea that the respondent no. 1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the accident. Perusal of copy of driving licence Ex R1 of respondent no.1 reveals that it was valid for driving the vehicle LMV,NT Transport on the date of the accident. The respondent no.3 has not brought any evidence on record to show the driving licence Ex. R1 was fake or invalid on the date of the accident or that the insured violated any other term or condition of the insurance policy. Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 17 LIABILITY; 22.Now, I advert to deal with the question of liability of the respondents to pay compensation. In the written statement respondent no.3 has not claimed that the vehicle bearing registration no. HR 55F- 9791 was not insured. Ex R2 is legal notice given by Sh. H.C. Jain ld. Counsel for respondent no.3 and after going through the legal notice Ex R2 it is clear that respondent no.3 has not disputed the validity of the insurance policy and by way of legal notice Ex. R2, respondent no.3 asked respondents no.1 and 2 to furnish the permit and fitness certificate. Permit and fitness certificate were tendered by respondents no.1 and 2 vide their statement. Ex. R3 is insurance policy and it appears that inadvertently respondents no.1 and 2 have tendered inusrance policy Ex R3 which was effecive from 17.10.2015 to 16.10.2016. It is admitted fact that accident took place on 28.3.2015. Photocopy of cover note dated 17.10.2014 issued by respondent no.3 is already placed on the file. In these circumstances, it cannot be said that vehicle in question was not insurued with respondent no.3, despite the fact that respondent no.2 inadvertently tendered insurance policy Ex R3. But in view of the fact of cover note placed on the file and in view of the fact that respondent no.3 has not disputed the fact that the vehicle in question was not insured with Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 18 insurance company and in these circumstances, respondent no.3 is liable to make the payment of compensatiion. RELIEF: 23 In view of my findings on the aforesaid issues, the claim petition is allowed in part with costs and a compensation of Rs. 7,77,500/- i.e. 50% amount of the total amount of 15,55,000/- is awarded to the petitioners along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per cent per annum to be calculated thereon from the date of the petition till realization, in equal share. The respondent nos. 1 to 3 are held liable to pay the amount of compensation of Rs 7,77,500/- jointly as well as severally. As the vehicle no. HR 55F -9791 was insured with respondent no.3 Insurance Comp any, as per cover note placed on file, therefore respondent no.3 would be liable to make the payment of amount of compensation. On realization of compensation amount along with interest, 50% of the amount alongwith interest accrued thereupon of the respective shares of petitioner Nos.1 to 3, be paid to them in cash and remaining 50% be deposited in the shape of FDRs in their names in any nationalized bank, fetching maximum interest for a period of three years. It is further directed that the amount of share of minor i.e Urmila etc vs Amrik etc 19 respondent no.3 be deposited in some Nationalized bank till he attained majority.

Sh Umesh Dhara Adv,for respondent No.1. Shri Ajay Sehrawat, Adv for respondent no.2. Ashish vs Suresh etc 2 AWARD The relevant and necessary facts to be noticed for disposal of this claim petition are that on 21.6.2015 the petitioner/ injured was going for interview for PO of SBI at Royal Institute, Chidana on his motorcycle no. HR 10M-7346, which was being driven by claimant at a moderate speed and with observing the traffic rules and at about 9.00A.M when the injured reached near the area of Lakhu Buwana, in the meantime, the offending vehicle came from opposite side being driven by its driver/respondent no.1 at a very high speed rashly and negligently and zig Zag manner and gave a hit directly to the motorcycle of the claimant, due to which the claimant fell down on road and sustained multiple , grievous injuries on his person and become unconscious. Immediately after the accident the petitioner was shifted to Tulip Hospital Sonepat, where he was medico legally examined and his MLR was prepared and he was operated upon and remained admitted in hospital from 21.6.2014 till 14.7.2014 and again admitted on 22.7.2015 and he is still under treatment. It has been pleaded that on 21.6.2015 and Ashish vs Suresh etc 3 22.6.2015 the claimant was unfit for statement and hence, he gave his statement on 23.6.2015, upon which FIR no.145 dated 23.6.2015 was registered at police station Israna,Panipat against the driver of offending vehicle no.

The petitioner has become unable to continue his work . Ashish vs Suresh etc 4 3. The petition was contested by the respondents. The respondent No.1 filed written statement. It was submitted that no accident took place with his vehicle. It was pleaded that the petitioner has filed a false and fictitious petition only to extract money from the answering respondent. It has been pleaded that it is the result of careless and negligence of the petitioner. Ownership of the vehicle is admitted. Remaining allegations are denied and prayer for dismissal of the petition has been made. 4.Respondent no.2 the insurer of petitioner filed written statement submitting that the petition is not maintainable as the vehicle was not insured on the date of accident and the vehicle in question bearing registration No. HR 47-9608 was running on the road in violation of the terms and condition of the insurance policy. Hence insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation. It was submitted that respondent no.1 has been falsely implicated in this case. FIR has been lodged in connivance with the local police. The amount of compensation Ashish vs Suresh etc 5 as claimed is on very higher side, excessive, exorbitant and without any basis. It was submitted that the claimant suffered injuries because of his own rash and negligent act. The accident took place due to mistake of claimant himself. Rest of the allegations were denied and prayer for dismissal of the petition has been made. 5. On the basis of the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed:- 1.Whether the accident in question resulting into the injuries suffered by Ashish Kumar son of Chunni Lal on 21.6.2015 at about 9.00A.M in the area of Lakhu Buwana on account of motor vehicular accident due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 while driving vehicle i.e Truck bearing registration no. HR 47-9608 ?OPP. 2.If issue No.1 is decided in favour of claimant, whether the petitioners are entitled to claim amount as claimed in the claim petition and from whom? OPP 3.Whether the petition is not maintainable in the present form? OPR 4.Whether respondent no.1 was not having effective and valid driving license at the time of accident?OPR. 5.Relief. Ashish vs Suresh etc 6 6.In his evidence, petitioner Ashish himself appeared as PW1 and examined Dr Prashant Tyagi as PW2, Dr SP Sharma as PW3 and Lokesh Kumar Accountant Shree Rma Mulkh, Instt. Of Engg. And Technology Kohra Bhura Tehsil Naraingarh Ambala, besides producing the following documents: Ex.P1 to 295 :MLR/Bills Ex P296 :Disability certificate Ex P297&298 :Salary slips Ex P299 :FIR Ex P300 :Report u/s173 Cr.PC 7. On the other hand, no evidence has been led on behalf of the respondents. However document Ex R1 to R7 have been tendered in evidence . 8. I have appraised the evidence on record, the material circumstances of the case and heard the arguments addressed by the learned counsel for the parties. My findings on the aforesaid issues are as Ashish vs Suresh etc 7 under: Issue No.1: 9.For the purpose of considering as to how the accident took place we have to analyze both oral as well as documentary evidence available on the record. 10.In order to prove this issue, petitioner himself stepped into the witness box as PW1 and tendered his affidavit Ex. PW1/A reiterating the facts as mentioned in the petition and deposed that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving on the part of the respondent no.1 and due to said accident he has suffered great physical pain, financial loss and mental agony and has become unable to do his routine work. Petitioner further deposed that after the accident he was admitted in Tulip Hospital and remained admitted there up to 14.7.2015 and again admitted on 22.7.20105 and is still under treatment and has not been recovered so far and is unable to do his routine work. He became 30% disabled. The petitioner has also placed reliance on copy of medical bills Ex P1 to Ashish vs Suresh etc 8 Ex P295 and disability certificate Ex P296. 11.The oral as well documentary evidence of the petitioner has completely gone unrebutted and unchallenged. A perusal of copy of the first information report Ex. 299 and Ex P300 copy of report under section 173 Cr.PC shows that the case regarding the accident in question was registered on the basis of statement of petitioner Ashish PW1. The version put forth in the first information report regarding the factum and manner of the accident is entirely in consonance with the statement of PW1 Ashish. 12.A perusal of the copy of FIR Ex P299 reveals that the respondent no. 1 was driving the offending vehicle bearing registration No. HR47-9608 on the date of accident. Had the accident not taken place due to the rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by the respondent no.1, then as a man of ordinary prudence, he must have approached the higher police authorities for cancellation of the case, but Ashish vs Suresh etc 9 neither there are pleadings nor any evidence on record to show that any step was taken by him in this direction. This conduct on the part of the respondent no.1 of remaining silent goes against him. Moreover, he has not dared to come forward in the witness box to say that he was not driving the offending vehicle at the time of the accident. Under such circumstances, it would be prima-facie safe and prudent to conclude that the accident in question took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle bearing registration No. HR 47-9608 by the respondent no.1. In this context, reference with advantage may also be made to Radhey Shayam Versus Girdhari Lal 1993 (2) P.L.R., 109. 13 In view of the fore-going discussion, I arrive at the conclusion that the accident in question resulting into injuries to petitioner took place due to the rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle bearing registration No. HR 47-9608 by the respondent no.1. Hence, the issue is decided in favour of the petitioner. Ashish vs Suresh etc 10 Issue No. 2: 14. PW1 further testified that after the accident he was shifted to Tulip hospital and was operated upon and remained admitted till 14.7.2015 and again admitted on 22.7.2015. Due to accident he became disabled and unable to perform his duty properly. He spent huge amount on his treatment, medicines, special diet, transportation etc. He produced on record Follow Up Medical record/bills of Tulip Hospital. He has suffered physical as well mental agony besides suffering financial loss. He produced disability certificate Ex. P296 and in order to prove the disability certificate petitioner has examined Dr S.P Sharma as P3, who proved disability certificate Ex P 296, in which it has been mentioned that patient suffered disability on account of S/T ununited fracture shaft right femur with stiffness right hip and knee with ILN. He proved disability certificate Ex P296. 15. Dr Parshant appeared as PW2 and he deposed that Ashish was admitted in their hospital on 21..6.2015 and was discharged on Ashish vs Suresh etc 11 14.7.2015 and he was again admitted on 23.7.2015 and was discharged on 28.7.2015. He was again admitted on 19.8.2015 and was discharged on 22.8.2015. He proved MLR Ex P1. The patient was admitted for crush injury right thigh with circumferential skin avulsion right thigh and fracture sharp femur right. He was operated on 22.6..2015, 17.2015 8.7.2015, 23.7.2015 and 19.8.2015. He proved bill Ex P2 amounting to Rs 3,50,600/- and Ex P3 amounting to Rs 46050/- and Ex. P4 of Rs 27,000/- He also proved bills Ex P5 to Ex P295. He deposed that the patient is not fully cured till date. The patient was in critical condition. 16.The petitioner further submitted that he was earning Rs 25,000/- per month, as he was working as Assistant professor in department of Electrical Engineering. In order to prove his income the petitioner has examined Lokesh Kumar Accountant who deposed that Ashish was working as Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering in their college and he was drawing the salary of Rs 25,000/- per month. From 1.7.2014 to 13.6.2015 and he is on leave Ashish vs Suresh etc 12 after the accident. He tendered documents Ex.P297 and Ex. P298 regarding salary of Mr Ashish. 17. From the afore-discussed evidence, it stands proved that petitioner suffered multiple injuries. A perusal of copy of medical record, medical bills etc reveals that the petitioner was having injuries /fractures. Therefore, there is no gainsaying that the petitioner is entitled to get compensation for the injuries sustained by him in the accident in question. 18. It is settled law that the Motor Vehicles Act is a welfare legislation. It has been promulgated to give relief to the injured of road side accidents. The contents of the petitions for claim are not to be substantiated strictly by the Indian Evidence Act in the like manner in cases concerning to civil as well as criminal nature. Therefore, the provisions concerning to valid exhibition of medical bills can be ignored, particularly when a representative of the hospital, where the medical store Ashish vs Suresh etc 13 is situated, has authenticated the same as has been done in the instant case. Therefore, the medical bills despite the objections raised by the opposite side can be considered for grant of compensation in favour of the petitioner. 19. The petitioner must have undergone the agony of physical as well as mental pain and sufferings on account of the injuries received in the accident. No hard and fast rule can perhaps be laid down for assessing the compensation for the pain and sufferings undergone by an injured. However, the nature of the injuries, parts of the body involved, the period of hospitalization, the period required for recovery from the injuries and age and socio-economic conditions of the injured can be the guiding factors. The petitioner has suffered fracture and he has to remain admitted in Tulip hospital for several days and must have spent the huge amount on the medicines. 20.No evidence in rebuttal has been led by the respondents. Ashish vs Suresh etc 14 However, keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case as well as the documents i.e. the medical bills, prescription slips regarding consultation the following reasonable amount of compensation is assessed to be paid to the petitioner : 1Medical bills Rs.7,68,347/- 2Hospitalization including Rs. 50,000/- attendant expenses/Loss of income etc. 3. Pain and sufferings Rs.20,000/- 4. Transportation, diet etc. Rs.05,000/- 5.Disability30x2000) Rs 60,000/- Total Rs. 9,03,347/- From the aforementioned discussion the petitioner is held entitled to get Rs.9,03,347/-In round figure 9,03,350/- as compensation. ISSUES NO.3 and 4: 21.In view of my finding on issues no.1 and 2, this petition is very much maintainable. Ashish vs Suresh etc 15 22.To substantiate this issue, no evidence was led by respondent No.2 insurance company to prove that offending vehicle was being driven by respondent No.1 in contravention of the terms and conditions of insurance policy. Copy of driving licence Ex R2 has been placed on record, from which, it stands proved on record that driving license was was issued by Licencing Authority and the said driving licence is meant for driving Transport,LMV ,NT and motorcycle. Accordingly, this issue is decided against respondent No.3. LIABILITY; 23.Now, I advert to deal with the question of liability of the respondents to pay compensation. It has been held under issues no.1 that the accident in question resulting into injuries to petitioner took place on account of rash and negligent driving of vehicle no. HR 47-9608 by respondent no. 1. There is no dispute regarding the fact that the said vehicle was owned by respondent no.1 and was insured with respondent no.2 at the time of accident. Hence respondents no.1 and 2 are held liable Ashish vs Suresh etc 16 to pay compensation to the petitioner on account of injuries suffered by the claimant in the said accident due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. However, as the vehicle was insured with respondent no.2 as per insurance policy Ex R1and R4. Therefore, first liability is of respondent no.2 to pay the amount of amount of compensation to the claimant. RELIEF; 24.In view of the findings recorded under the aforesaid issues, the petition is accepted partly with costs. The petitioner is held entitled to a total compensation of Rs.9,03,347/-. In round figure 9,03,350/- (Nine lakh three thousand three hundred and fifty only) in respect of the injuries sustained by him in the accident in question and the resultant effects thereof. The respondents no.1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation. As the vehicle is insured with respondent no.2, therefore, respondent no.2 is held liable to pay the amount of compensation to the petitioner. Ashish vs Suresh etc 17 On realization of compensation amount along with interest, all the compensation amount be given to the petitioner in cash. 25. In view of the observations made by the Hon’ble Apex Court in New India Assurance Company Limited Versus Charlie and another, 2005 (2) The Punjab Law Reporter, 661 and Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation Limited Versus S. Rajapriya and others, 2005 (2) The Punjab Law Reporter, 650 , the petitioners is also allowed interest on the amount of compensation so awarded at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the date of payment.

Sharma, Advocate for petitioners Shri Pawan Ranga, Advocate for respondent Nos.1 and 2 Shri Ajay Garg, Advocate for respondent No.3 AWARD - On 23.02.2015, Friaz (since deceaed) along with respondent No.1 Rahul was going to Nangloi, Delhi on a motorcycle bearing registraton No.HR-10V-6818, which was being driven by respondent No.1 Abida and another Versus Rahul and others -2- Rahul at a moderate speed, while observing the traffic rules and Friaz (since deceased) was the pillion rider and when they reached near village Garhi Bindroli, suddenly a stray beast struck against the said motorcycle, due to the impact of the same, the motorcycle along with its occupants fell down on the road and both Friaz and Rahul sustained multiple serious injuries on their person and Friaz unfortunately expired at the spot . After the accident, deceased was shifted to General Hospital, Sonipat, whereas he was declared brought dead by doctor concerned and postmortem on his dead body was conducted on the same day. A DDR No.13 dated 23.02.2015 was recorded at Police Station, Kharkhoda on the basis of statement of Gulshan, regarding the accident. 2.The present claim petition was filed by the petitioners being legal representatives of deceased Friaz under Section 163-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as the Act), claiming a total compensation of Rs.1 0 lacs, inter alia, pleading therein that deceased was a labourer and earning Rs.3,200/- per month. The petitioners have been deprived of his love and affection. 3.The petition was contested by the respondents. The respondent Nos.1 and 2, the driver and owner of the vehicle in question, in their joint written statement though admitted the factum of accident, but took the stand that same had not occurred due to rash and neglignet driving of respondent No.1. Respondent No.3 insurance company, with which the Abida and another Versus Rahul and others -3- vehicle in question was insured at the time of accident, in its written statement denied the factual position of the alleged accident. The insurance company submitted that the vehicle in question has been falsely implicated in order to extort money. The amount of compensation claimed in the petition was also stated to be highly excessive and fanciful. Insurance company also denied the personal particulars of the deceased with regard to his income, age etc. Respondent No.3 insurance company has also raised some preliminary objections and one of them was that respondent No.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence to drive the vehicle in question at the time of the accident. The other allegations of the petitioners were also controverted. It was thus prayed by the respondents that the petition be dismissed with heavy costs. 4.On the basis of the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed vide order dated 29.09.2015 - 1.Whether the accident in qeustion resulting into the death of Friaz had occurred on 23.02.2015 when he was the pillion rider and respondent No.1 Rahul was driving the motorcycle bearing registration No.HR-10V-6818 when they reached near Garhi Biondroli one Neel Gai (winder beast) struck against the motorcycle, resultantly said Friaz had died in that accident? OPP 2.If issue No.1 is decided in favour of claimants, whether the Abida and another Versus Rahul and others -4- petitioners are entitled to claim amount as claimed in the claim petition and from whom? OPP 3.Whether the petition is not maintainable in the present form? OPR 4.Whether the insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation? OPR 5.Relief. 5.The parties led oral as well as documentary evidence in support of their respective claims. 6.I have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and have also perused the record of the case very carefully. My issuewise findings are as under - ISSUE NO.1 - 7. Since the claim petition has been filed by legal representatives of deceased Friaz under Section 163-A of the Act, the only thing which the petitioners are required to prove is whether the accident in question resulting in death of Friaz has arisen out of the use of the vehicle bearing registration No.HR-10V-6818. 8.In order to prove this issue, petitioners have examined PW-2 Gulshan, an eye witness to the accident, who when stepped into the witness box reiterated the contents of petition and deposed on oath that on 23.02.2015, Friaz (since deceaed) along with respondent No.1 Rahul son of Aliyash was going to Nangloi, Delhi on motorcycle bearing registraton Abida and another Versus Rahul and others -5- No.HR-10V-6818, which was being driven by respondent No.1 Rahul at a moderate speed while observing the traffic rules and Friaz (since deceased) was the pillion rider and when they reached near village Garhi Bindroli, suddenly a stray beast struck against the said motorcycle, due to the impact of the same, the motorcycle along with its occupants fell down on the road and both Friaz and Rahul sustained multiple serious injuries on their person and Friaz unfortunately expired at the spot . He has further deposed that after the accident, deceased was shifted to General Hospital, Sonipat, whereas he was declared brought dead by the doctor concerned and postmortem on his dead body was conducted on the same day. He further deposed that DDR No.13 dated 23.02.2015 was recorded with Police Station, Kharkhoda on the basis of his statement . 9.Ex.P-1 is copy of DDR No.13 dated 23.02.2015, got recorded by PW-2 Gulshan and contents of the same have been duly corroborated by the testimony of PW-2 Gulshan regarding factum of accident and f rom the lengthy cross examination, the veracity of testimony PW-2 Gulshan could not be impeached or belied. On the other hand, no evidence was led in rebuttal by the respondents. Therefore, considering the evidence led by petitioners, it can safely be concluded that accident in question resulting in death of Friaz has arisen out of the use of motorcycle bearing registration No.HR-10V-6818. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners. Abida and another Versus Rahul and others -6- ISSUE NO.2 - 11. Now, the question to be considered is as to the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners. The evidence on record in the shape of attested copy of the postmortem report Ex.P 2 of the deceased Friaz shows that the deceased was 22 years of age at the time of his death. Admittedly, he died leaving behind his widow petitioner No.1 besides his mother petitioner No.2. Petitioner No.1 Abida, widow of deceased, while appearing as PW-1 in h er affidavit Ex.PW 1/A has testified that her deceased husband was earning Rs.3,200 /- per month by working as a labourer and they were dependent upon the income of the deceased. She further deposed that they spent Rs.50,000/- on transportation and last rites of the deceased. 12.Now, in view of the testimony of PW-1 Abida and the minimum wages prevailing in the State, the monthly income of deceased Friaz at the time of his unfortunate death was Rs.3,200/- per month and as such, his annual income comes to Rs.38,400/-to say Rs.39,000/- per annum. 13.As per the Second Schedule and age of deceased, a multiplier of 17 would be appropriate and the compensation on this basis would work out to Rs.6,63,000 /- (39,000x17). After deduction 1/3rd amount as per Second Schedule, the amount comes to Rs.4,42,000 /-. In addition to the compensation awarded above, the claimants will also be entitled to a sum Abida and another Versus Rahul and others -7- of Rs.2500/- under the head of loss of estate and Rs.2000/- towards funeral expenses. The petitioner No.1 Abida, widow of deceased, is also entitled to a sum of Rs.5000/- on account of loss of consortium . In total, a compensation of Rs.4,51,500/- is awarded to petitioners along with interest at the rate of 7.50% per annum to be calculated thereon from the date of filing of petition till realization. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners.

After the accident, deceased was shifted to General Hospital, Sonipat, whereas he was declared brought dead by doctor concerned and postmortem on his dead body was conducted on the same day. A DDR No.13 dated 23.02.2015 was recorded at Police Station, Kharkhoda on the basis of statement of Gulshan, regarding the accident. 2.The present claim petition was filed by the petitioners being legal representatives of deceased Friaz under Section 163-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as the Act), claiming a total compensation of Rs.1 0 lacs, inter alia, pleading therein that deceased was a labourer and earning Rs.3,200/- per month. The petitioners have been deprived of his love and affection. 3.The petition was contested by the respondents. The respondent Nos.1 and 2, the driver and owner of the vehicle in question, in their joint written statement though admitted the factum of accident, but took the stand that same had not occurred due to rash and neglignet driving of respondent No.1. Respondent No.3 insurance company, with which the Abida and another Versus Rahul and others -3- vehicle in question was insured at the time of accident, in its written statement denied the factual position of the alleged accident. The insurance company submitted that the vehicle in question has been falsely implicated in order to extort money. The amount of compensation claimed in the petition was also stated to be highly excessive and fanciful. Insurance company also denied the personal particulars of the deceased with regard to his income, age etc. Respondent No.3 insurance company has also raised some preliminary objections and one of them was that respondent No.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence to drive the vehicle in question at the time of the accident. The other allegations of the petitioners were also controverted. It was thus prayed by the respondents that the petition be dismissed with heavy costs. 4.On the basis of the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed vide order dated 29.09.2015 - 1.Whether the accident in qeustion resulting into the death of Friaz had occurred on 23.02.2015 when he was the pillion rider and respondent No.1 Rahul was driving the motorcycle bearing registration No.HR-10V-6818 when they reached near Garhi Biondroli one Neel Gai (winder beast) struck against the motorcycle, resultantly said Friaz had died in that accident?

OPP 3.Whether the petition is not maintainable in the present form? OPR 4.Whether the insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation? OPR 5.Relief. 5.The parties led oral as well as documentary evidence in support of their respective claims. 6.I have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and have also perused the record of the case very carefully. My issuewise findings are as under - ISSUE NO.1 - 7. Since the claim petition has been filed by legal representatives of deceased Friaz under Section 163-A of the Act, the only thing which the petitioners are required to prove is whether the accident in question resulting in death of Friaz has arisen out of the use of the vehicle bearing registration No.HR-10V-6818. 8.In order to prove this issue, petitioners have examined PW-2 Gulshan, an eye witness to the accident, who when stepped into the witness box reiterated the contents of petition and deposed on oath that on 23.02.2015, Friaz (since deceaed) along with respondent No.1 Rahul son of Aliyash was going to Nangloi, Delhi on motorcycle bearing registraton Abida and another Versus Rahul and others -5- No.HR-10V-6818, which was being driven by respondent No.1 Rahul at a moderate speed while observing the traffic rules and Friaz (since deceased) was the pillion rider and when they reached near village Garhi Bindroli, suddenly a stray beast struck against the said motorcycle, due to the impact of the same, the motorcycle along with its occupants fell down on the road and both Friaz and Rahul sustained multiple serious injuries on their person and Friaz unfortunately expired at the spot . He has further deposed that after the accident, deceased was shifted to General Hospital, Sonipat, whereas he was declared brought dead by the doctor concerned and postmortem on his dead body was conducted on the same day. He further deposed that DDR No.13 dated 23.02.2015 was recorded with Police Station, Kharkhoda on the basis of his statement . 9.Ex.P-1 is copy of DDR No.13 dated 23.02.2015, got recorded by PW-2 Gulshan and contents of the same have been duly corroborated by the testimony of PW-2 Gulshan regarding factum of accident and f rom the lengthy cross examination, the veracity of testimony PW-2 Gulshan could not be impeached or belied. On the other hand, no evidence was led in rebuttal by the respondents. Therefore, considering the evidence led by petitioners, it can safely be concluded that accident in question resulting in death of Friaz has arisen out of the use of motorcycle bearing registration No.HR-10V-6818. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners. Abida and another Versus Rahul and others -6- ISSUE NO.2 - 11. Now, the question to be considered is as to the quantum of compensation payable to the petitioners. The evidence on record in the shape of attested copy of the postmortem report Ex.P 2 of the deceased Friaz shows that the deceased was 22 years of age at the time of his death. Admittedly, he died leaving behind his widow petitioner No.1 besides his mother petitioner No.2. Petitioner No.1 Abida, widow of deceased, while appearing as PW-1 in h er affidavit Ex.PW 1/A has testified that her deceased husband was earning Rs.3,200 /- per month by working as a labourer and they were dependent upon the income of the deceased. She further deposed that they spent Rs.50,000/- on transportation and last rites of the deceased. 12.Now, in view of the testimony of PW-1 Abida and the minimum wages prevailing in the State, the monthly income of deceased Friaz at the time of his unfortunate death was Rs.3,200/- per month and as such, his annual income comes to Rs.38,400/-to say Rs.39,000/- per annum. 13.As per the Second Schedule and age of deceased, a multiplier of 17 would be appropriate and the compensation on this basis would work out to Rs.6,63,000 /- (39,000x17). After deduction 1/3rd amount as per Second Schedule, the amount comes to Rs.4,42,000 /-. In addition to the compensation awarded above, the claimants will also be entitled to a sum Abida and another Versus Rahul and others -7- of Rs.2500/- under the head of loss of estate and Rs.2000/- towards funeral expenses. The petitioner No.1 Abida, widow of deceased, is also entitled to a sum of Rs.5000/- on account of loss of consortium . In total, a compensation of Rs.4,51,500/- is awarded to petitioners along with interest at the rate of 7.50% per annum to be calculated thereon from the date of filing of petition till realization. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners.

Mani Ram etc. AWARD : Present claim petition has been filed by the petitioner on account of the injuries suffered by him in a Motor Vehicular Accident taken place on 11.03.2012 near D.I.T.M. College, village Chirasmi, P.S. Gannaur, due to rash and negligent driving of car bearing registration No.HR-06U/9000 (hereinafter be referred to as offending vehicle) by the respondent No.1. 2.Brief facts of the claim petition are that on 11.03.2012, the petitioner along with his cousin Sandeep was going to village Chirasmi from G.T. Road on motorcycle bearing No.HR-42A/6669 driving by Sandeep and he was pillion rider. When the petitioner alongwith Sandeep reached near the gate of D.I.T.M. College, Chirasmi, the respondent No.1 came while driving the offending vehicle at a very high speed, rashly and negligently and without following traffic rules from the side of G.T. Road and directly hit the back side of his motorcycle, as a result of which, the petitioner and Sandeep fell on the road. The respondent No.1 stopped with his vehicle for a while at the spot and thereafter, fled away from the spot. The petitioner and Sandeep were taken to hospital by Virender son of Jai Narayan who 3 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. was on his motorcycle behind the petitioner. Said accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1. In this accident, the petitioner sustained injuries/fractures in his right leg, thigh and right knee and also sustained other injuries. After conducting MLR at CHC, Gannaur, he was referred to Patil Hospital, Sonepat where X-ray was done by the doctor and remained hospitalised there for 3 days. Thereafter, he was referred to Shiva Hospital, Sonepat where he was operated twice and remained hospitalised there for 12 days. He was advised complete bed rest for six months. He incurred Rs.5 lacs on his treatment. At the time of accident, he was earning Rs.10,000/- per month. He suffered a great mental agony and huge financial loss due to this accident. On the basis of statement of complainant Virender, an FIR No.95 dated 12.03.2012, under Sections 279/337 of the Indian Penal Code was registered with Police Station, Gannaur, against respondent No.1. The petitioner on account of injuries sustained in accident, has claimed compensation to the tune of Rs.15.00 lacs with interest @ 12% per annum from the date of filing of petition till its realisation. 3.Upon notice, respondent Nos.1 and 2, in their joint written 4 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. statement, have resisted the present claim petition on the grounds that no such accident has ever been taken place with the offending vehicle on the alleged date, time and place and a false FIR has been lodged against the respondent No.1. The respondent No.1 is having a valid driving licence and respondent No.2 is having valid registration certificate and offending vehicle is insured with respondent No.3. They have alleged the amount of compensation to be excessive and exorbitant and also prayed for the dismissal of the petition. 4.The respondent No.3 i.e. insurance company in its separately filed written statement, has resisted the claim petition on the grounds that on the day of accident, respondent No.1 did not possess a legal and valid driving license to drive the car in question nor any intimation regarding said accident was ever given to it as required under Section 134(C) of the M.V . Act. The answering respondent has taken all the defences under Sections 147, 149 and 157 of M.V . Act. On merits, it has denied the factum of accident as stated in the petition and averred that in fact, no alleged accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of car in question by respondent No.1 and a false case has been got registered against 5 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. respondent No.1 in order to extract fake compensation from it. It is denied by the answering respondent that the petitioner was earning Rs.15,000/- per month or that he incurred Rs.5 lacs on his treatment. Besides praying for dismissal of claim petition, the insurance company has alleged the amount of compensation to be excessive and exorbitant. 5.No rejoinder was filed and on the pleadings of parties, the following issues were settled for adjudication on 06.02.2015 - 1.Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle bearing registration No.HR-06U-9000, by its driver-respondent No.1 on 11.3.2012, owned by respondent No.2, causing injuries to Anil as alleged? OPP. 2.If issue No.1 is decided in favour of petitioner/petitioner, whether the petitioner/petitioner is entitled to claim amount as claimed in the claim petition and from whom? OPP 3.Whether the respondent No.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence on the date and at the time of alleged accident or that violated the terms and conditions of insurance policy, if so its effect? OPR-3 4.Relief. 6.In order to prove his case, petitioner examined complainant Virender Singh as PW1, Sumit as PW2 and Dr. Atul Patil 6 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. as PW3. The petitioner has relied upon documents Ex.P1 to Ex.P23. 7.On the other hand, respondents did not examine any witness. Counsel for respondents No.1&2 tendered into evidence documents Ex.R2 to Ex.R4 and closed the evidence on behalf of respondents No.1&2 vide his separately recorded statement. Counsel for respondents No.3 tendered into evidence document Ex.R1 and closed the evidence on behalf of respondent No.3 vide his separately recorded statement. 8.I have heard the arguments on behalf of both sides and going through the case file, my issue-wise findings are as under - ISSUE No.1 9. Onus to prove this issue was upon the petitioner. Under this issue, the petitioner was required to prove that on 11.3.2012, an accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle i.e. car bearing No.HR-06U/9000 by its driver respondent No.1 and caused injuries to the petitioner. In order to discharge his onus, petitioner examined three witnesses. PW1 is Virender. He tendered his duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW1/A in evidence and deposed that on 11.3.2012, Sandeep and 7 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. his cousin Anil were going to village Chirasmi from G.T. Road. Sandeep was driving the motorcycle bearing No.HR-42A/6669 and Anil was pillion rider and when they reached near the gate of DITM College, Chirasmi, then, suddenly offending vehicle HR-06U/9000 being driven by respondent No.1 in rash and negligent manner and without obeying traffic rules and hit back-side of the motorcycle occupied by said Sandeep and Anil. They fell down on the road with their motorcycle and received serious and multiple injuries on their person. Respondent No.1 stopped his vehicle and then, ran away from the spot. Sandeep and Anil were taken to hospital by him. The accident was caused due to rash and negligent and high speed driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1. PW2 is Sumit. He is General Power of Attorney holder of petitioner. He tendered his duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW2/A in evidence and reiterated the averments of the petition which is not being discussed as summarized version of the petitioner has already been discussed. PW3 is Dr. Atul Patil from Shiva Hospital, Dev Nagar, Sonepat. He deposed that on 13.03.2012 at 10.30 A.M., he admitted 8 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. patient Anil son of Joginder, 18 years old male, resident of Chirasmi, Ganaur, with fracture femur right and fracture tibia right with alleged history of road side accident. MLR was done at Gannaur, for which surgery was done. Interlock nailing of femur was done under spinal anesthesia. He was discharged in satisfactory condition on 23.03.2012. On 24.10.2014, he admitted patient Anil son of Dil Singh, resident of Jaisingpur, Karnal with the diagnosis old operated fractured femur right side and surgery was done and nail was removed and he was discharged on 26.10.2014. Bills Ex.P2 to Ex.P17 are issued by their hospital. 10.Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has argued that it has been proved that on 11.3.2012, the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1 due to which petitioner received injuries. FIR was lodged against the respondent No.1 which support the case of the petitioner. 11.On the other hand, learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondent No.3 has argued that petitioner has filed the present petition in collusion with respondents No.1&2. PW1 Virender Singh is a procured witness. No such accident took place. petitioner has filed a 9 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. false claim petition in order to claim compensation from the insurance company. He has further argued that petitioner did not appear in the witness box to prove his case. PW2 Sumit Power of Attorney Holder of petitioner appeared in the witness box but he cannot depose on behalf of petitioner. He was not present at the spot at the time of alleged accident, therefore, he has no personal knowledge about the alleged accident. It was petitioner who could prove his case and he could have been cross-examined on the question of alleged injuries sustained in the alleged accident. So, the claim petition may kindly be dismissed. 12.I have given my thoughtful consideration to the rival submissions advanced by learned counsel for the parties. 13.It is true that petitioner Anil himself did not appear in the witness box to prove his case but there is sufficient evidence on case file to prove the accident in question and it has been proved by oral as well as documentary evidence that the alleged accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle bearing No.HR- 06U/9000 by respondent No.1. The petitioner has also produced the final report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex.P1, site plan Ex.P2 of the 10 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. place of occurrence and First Information Report Ex.P4. 14.It is apparent that Virender Singh appeared in the witness box as PW1 and it was claimed in his affidavit Ex.PW1/A tendered by him in his evidence that on 11.3.2012, Sandeep and his cousin namely Anil were going to village Chirasmi. He witnessed the accident which took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle bearing No.HR-06U/9000 by respondent No.1. PW1 Virender Singh has further deposed that petitioner Sandeep and pillion rider Anil sustained injuries in this accident and he took them to the hospital. Ex.P4 FIR was lodged on the basis of statement of Virender Singh PW1 against respondent No.1 in Police Station, Gannaur. 15.Further, PW1 Virender Singh is subjected to lengthy cross-examination, but nothing came out which may belied his version. FIR Ex.P4 resulted into prosecution of respondent No.1 Mani Ram and vide report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex.P1, a prosecution was launched against respondent No.1. These facts are themselves sufficient corroboration to the testimony of PW1 Virender Singh. Further, the testimony of PW1 Virender Singh has gone unrebutted, as respondent No.1 Mani Ram did not dare to step into witness box to 11 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. substantiate his plea taken in the written statement that no such accident had ever taken place and he has been falsely implicated in the present case. Moreover, had respondent No.1 Mani Ram been falsely implicated in the criminal case, then, he would have filed a complaint to the higher authorities regarding his false involvement, but no such allegation is shown to have been filed. 16.Further it is apparent that FIR against respondent No.1 was registered under Sections 279, 337 and 338 IPC. MLR of petitioner Anil is also on case file. Although, the MLR is not proved but can be taken into consideration. In view of above discussions and reasonings, this Tribunal reached at the conclusion that said accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle bearing No.HR-06U/9000 by respondent No.1 Mani Ram and petitioner sustained injuries. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.2 : 17.Onus to prove this issue was upon the petitioner. The petitioner has claimed compensation of Rs.15,00,000/- on account of injuries sustained by him in said accident. In case of compensation on 12 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. account of injuries, the Tribunal has to see the nature of injuries, duration of treatment, expenses spent on treatment, pain and suffering, mental agony, special diet and loss of income of injured. In order to prove his claim, petitioner has examined PW3 Dr. Atul Patil and relied upon the medicine bills and hospital bills Ex.P1 to Ex.P17. Perusal of testimony of PW3 Dr. Atul Patil and documentary evidence produced by the petitioner reveals that the petitioner produced no evidence to prove that he received treatment of the injuries allegedly sustained in the alleged accident. Ex.P15 to Ex.P17 are photocopies of medical bills. Although these bills have not been proved as per provisions of Evidence Act, but, it is apparent that these bills pertain to Anil son of Joginder resident of village Chirasmi, Tehsil Ganaur, District Sonepat. PW3 Dr. Atul Patil has also deposed that on 13.3.2012 at about 10.30 AM, he admitted patient Anil son of Joginder, 18 years old, resident of village Chiramsi, Tehsil Gannaur, District Sonepat, whereas petitioner Anil is son of Dil Singh resident of village Jaisingpur, Tehsil Assandh, District Karnal. Ex.P2, Ex.P3, Ex.P9 to Ex.P11 appear to be prescription slips but bear no name of doctor or patient. Remaining medicine bills and hospital bills pertain 13 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. to the month of October, 2014 whereas alleged accident took place on 11.3.2012. petitioner produced no evidence to prove that he took treatment in the month of October, 2014 of the injuries sustained by him in the alleged accident took place on 11.3.2012. So, these medicine bills and hospital bills are of no help to the case of petitioner. 18.In view of above discussions and reasonings, this Tribunal has no hesitation in holding that the petitioner has miserably failed to prove the alleged expenses incurred by him on his treatment of the injuries sustained in the alleged accident, so, the petitioner is not entitled to any compensation. Accordingly, this issue is decided against the petitioner and in favour of the respondents. ISSUE NO.3 : 19.Onus to prove this issue was upon the respondent No.3. To substantiate this issue, no evidence was led by respondent No.3 to prove that offending vehicle was being driven by respondent No.1 in contravention of the terms and conditions of insurance policy. Copy of driving licence Ex.R2/Ex.P23 was produced, from which, it stands proved on record that Ex.R2/Ex.P23 was issued by Licencing Authority, Assandh and is valid w.e.f. 20.3.2006 to 19.3.2026 and the 14 Anil Vs. Mani Ram etc. accident in question took place on 11.3.2012. Thus, this issue is decided against respondent No.3. RELIEF :- 20.In view of the findings of this Tribunal returned on issues under adjudication, present claim petition fails and the same is hereby dismissed. No order as to costs. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly. File be consigned to records after due compliance.

On the pleadings of the parties following issues were framed vide order dated 20.5.2016: 1.Whether the accident in question resulting into the death of Ram Swarth son of Dhano Singh had occurred on account of motor vehicular accident dated 22.2.2015 at about 4.30.P.M in the area of Pritampura cut GT Road by respondent no.1 on account of his rash and negligent driving while driving offending vehicle I.e car bearing registration no.

On the other hand, the respondent have not examined any witness in support of their claim. However the respondents have tendered the documents . 8.I have appraised the evidence on record, the material circumstances of the case and heard the arguments addressed by Sh. RS Malik. counsel for the petitioners and Dinesh Bedi, ld. counsel for respondent no.1 and 2 and Sh Jogender Kuhar ld. counsel for respondent no. 3. My findings on the aforesaid issues are as under: ISSUE No.1: 9. The onus to prove this issue is on the petitioners. The petitioners are required to lead evidence that accident took place due to Parvati etc vs Vinay etc) 7 rash and negligent driving of car bearing registration no. DL 8 CL-5351 by respondent no.1. In order to prove this issue, petitioner Urmila stepped into the witness box as PW1 and tendered her affidavit Ex. PW1/A reiterating the facts as mentioned in the petition and deposed that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1 and due to said accident her husband died. She deposed that her husband was 43 years of age. They suffered financial loss and mental agony. She deposed that her husband was earning Rs.11,000/- per month as he was doing labour work. They have no other source of income. During cross-examination she deposed that she has no proof of income. 10.Petitioner No.2 Santosh also supported the version of PW1 Urmila. 11.PW3 Ramashish is eye witnesses and he deposed that due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle no. DL-8CL-5351 accident took place in which Ram Swwarth lost his life. He also deposed that in the accident Amresh and Roshan also received injuries. There is no ground to disbelieve the evidence of PW3 Ramashish the eye-witness of the alleged accident. In view of the evidence PW3Ramashish who is eye witness of the accident, it is clear that respondent no.1 was driving the car in question in a rash and negligent manner. Parvati etc vs Vinay etc) 8 12. It is the case of the petitioners that on 22.2.2015 deceased Ramswarth alongwith Amresh and Roshan was going from his village for refilling the gas cylinder and when they reached Pritam pura cut at GT road, in the meantime offending car no. DL-8CL-5351 driven by respondent no.1 in a rash and negligent manner came there and gave a direct hit to the cycle of Roshan and then struck against Amresh and deceased Ram Swarth. Due to the impact, Ram Swarth suffered grievous injuries and succumbed to the injuries. The version mentioned in the petition is supported by FIR Ex P2, and PMR Ex P3, charge sheet Ex P7 as well as evidence of eye witness of the alleged accident. 13.The oral as well as documentary evidence of the petitioners has gone completely un-rebutted and unchallenged. A perusal of copy of the first information report Ex P2 shows that the case regarding the accident in question was registered on the basis of statement of Ramashish. The registration number of the offending vehicle involved in the accident has been mentioned in the FIR as DL-8CL-5351 and the FIR was promptly lodged on the date of accident. The version put forth in the first information report regarding the factum and manner of the accident is entirely in consonance with the statement of eye witness PW3 Ram Ashish. He categorically stated that the accident in question had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle bearing registration no. DL-8CL-5351 driven by the respondent no.1. Parvati etc vs Vinay etc) 9 14. Had the accident not taken place due to the rash and negligent driving of the vehicle in question by the respondent no.1, then as a man of ordinary prudence, he must have approached the higher police authorities for cancellation of the case, but neither there are pleadings nor any evidence on record to show that any step was taken by him in this direction. This conduct on the part of the respondent no.1 of remaining silent goes against him. Even Respondent no.1 did not dare to appear in the witness to prove that the accident in question had not taken place due to his rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Under such circumstances, it would be prima-facie safe and prudent to conclude that the accident in question took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by the respondent no.1. In this context, reference with advantage may also be made to R adhey Shayam Versus Girdhari Lal 1993 (2) P.L.R., 109. 15.From the statement of PW 3 Ram Ashiish coupled with the copy of FIR Ex. P2, PMR Ex P3, and report under section 173 Cr.PC,Ex P2 and charge sheet Ex P7, it stands established that Ram Swarth died in the motor vehicular accident, due to rash and negligent driving of car by respondent no.1. 16.In view of the fore-going circumstances, I arrive at the conclusion that the accident in question resulting into death of Ram Parvati etc vs Vinay etc) 10 Swarth took place due to the rash and negligent driving of vehicle bearing no. DL-8CL-5351 by the respondent No.1. Hence, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUE No. 2: 17. This claim petition is in respect of death of Ram Swarth. In this claim petition petitioner Urmila, when appeared in the witness box as PW1 has testified that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. Ex P2 is the copy of FIR. It is, therefore, crystal clear that immediately after the accident deceased Ramswarth died at the spot due to injuries suffered in the accident. She proved post mortem report Ex P3 of deceased Ramswarth. After going through the entire evidence on the file it is clear that deceased Ramswath died due to the injuries suffered in the accident. 18In the claim petition, it has been submitted that the deceased was earning Rs. 11,000- per month as he was doing labour work . In order to prove the income of deceased the petitioner has not placed on record any document regarding income of deceased. During cross- examination she deposed that she has not brought any document pertaining to income of deceased. The petitioners have not placed on record any document to prove the income of deceased. In the absence of which it cannot be said that deceased was earning Rs.11,000/- per Parvati etc vs Vinay etc) 11 month. In the post mortem report Ex P3, age of deceased is mentioned as 42 years. Medical evidence cannot be discarded. Therefore, for the purpose of assessing compensation, it would be proper to consider the age of the deceased as 42 years at the time of his death, and disclosed by the petitioners in the evidence as well as in the petition. 19 Now, coming to the dependency. Petitioner no.1 is mother of deceased and petitioners no.2 is wife and petitioner no.3 is son of deceased Ramswarth. It has been stated by PW1 that after the death of her husband they have no other source of income. The evidence adduced by the petitioner has gone unrebutted on this point. Petitioner no.1 being mother, petitioner no..2 being wife and petitioner no. 3 being son/legal heirs of deceased are entitled to get compensation for the death of the deceased in the ill-fated accident. Therefore total family members dependent on the income of deceased are three. 20.The petitioners have not placed on record any document to support the allegations that deceased used to earn Rs.11,000/- per month. In other words he was doing labour work and could have earned sufficient monthly income to maintain his family consisting him i.e. his wife, mother and children. Therefore, the income of the deceased was certainly more than a male casual labourer. Accordingly, for the purpose of assessing the compensation, the income of deceased is assessed at Rs.8,000/- per month. In view of authority titled as Munna Parvati etc vs Vinay etc) 12 Lal Jain vs Vipin Kumar Sharma 2015(6) SCC 347 and Shri Ram General Insurance Company Limited vs Karnail Kaur and others 2015-4, PLR 324, the deceased being of 43 years of age at the time of his death, 30% income earned by him is to be added as prospects of future income and considering the age of deceased as 43 years the total income of the deceased after adding 30% of the income comes to Rs.10,400/- per month i.e. 1,24,800/- per year. It has also been laid down by the Apex Court in Smt. Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transportation Corporation and another 2009 (3) PLR 22, where the deceased was married, the deduction towards personal and living expenses of the deceased should be one third where the number of dependant family members is 2 to 3, one fourth where the number of the dependant family members is 4 to 6 and one fifth where the number of dependant family members exceeds six. Therefore, after deducting one third of the income of the deceased as her personal expenses, contribution towards his family comes to Rs. 83200/-per year. As per law laid down in Smt. Sarla Verma and others’ case 2009-3, PLR 22 the multiplier to be applied is of 14. So, the compensation after applying multiplier of 14 comes to 83200x14=11,64800/- 21.The petitioners might have suffered some expenses on the last rites of the deceased besides suffering loss of estate. As per law laid down in Rajesh and others vs Rajbir Singh and others 2013 Parvati etc vs Vinay etc) 13 (3) RCR (Civil) 170(SC), petitioner's wife is awarded an amount of Rs.1,00,000/- towards loss of consortium. The petitioners are further allowed Rs.25,000/- towards funeral expenses and Rs 1,00,000/- are granted for love and affection to the children of the deceased. Thus, the total amount payable to the petitioners comes to Rs. 13,89,800/- . Issue no.2 is decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUE No.3 22. To substantiate this issue, no evidence was led by respondent No.3 insurance company to prove that offending vehicle was being driven by respondent No.1 in contravention of the terms and conditions of insurance policy. Copy of driving licence Ex.R-6 was produced, from which, it stands proved on record that Ex.R-6 was issued by Licencing Authority, and is valid for driving the motorcycle, motorcyle, LMV etc and as such the said driving licence Ex.R6 is meant for driving vehicle. Accordingly, this issue is decided against respondent No.3. Further a perusal of Ex R4 insurance policy reveals that the vehicle in question was insured with the respondent no.3. In the written statement respondent no.3 has not taken the plea that the vehicle bearing registration no. DL-8CL-5351 was not insured with respondent no.3 at the time of accident. RELIEF: 23In view of the findings of this Tribunal returned on the issues under adjudication, present petition succeeds and same is accepted with costs and claimants are held entitled to compensation of Parvati etc vs Vinay etc) 14 Rs. 13,89,800/- .

Petitioners are also entitled to interest on the compensation amount at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till its actual realization. together with proportionate interest accrued thereon. It is made clear that out of total amount Rs 13,89,800/- Rs 2 lacs be given to petitioner no.1 being old aged mother of deceased. Petitioners no.2 and 3 are entitled to get remaining Rs 11,89,800/- in equal shares. 24.

DL-8CL-5351 by the respondent No.1. Hence, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUE No. 2: 17. This claim petition is in respect of death of Ram Swarth. In this claim petition petitioner Urmila, when appeared in the witness box as PW1 has testified that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. Ex P2 is the copy of FIR. It is, therefore, crystal clear that immediately after the accident deceased Ramswarth died at the spot due to injuries suffered in the accident. She proved post mortem report Ex P3 of deceased Ramswarth. After going through the entire evidence on the file it is clear that deceased Ramswath died due to the injuries suffered in the accident. 18In the claim petition, it has been submitted that the deceased was earning Rs. 11,000- per month as he was doing labour work . In order to prove the income of deceased the petitioner has not placed on record any document regarding income of deceased. During cross- examination she deposed that she has not brought any document pertaining to income of deceased. The petitioners have not placed on record any document to prove the income of deceased. In the absence of which it cannot be said that deceased was earning Rs.11,000/- per Parvati etc vs Vinay etc) 11 month. In the post mortem report Ex P3, age of deceased is mentioned as 42 years. Medical evidence cannot be discarded. Therefore, for the purpose of assessing compensation, it would be proper to consider the age of the deceased as 42 years at the time of his death, and disclosed by the petitioners in the evidence as well as in the petition. 19 Now, coming to the dependency. Petitioner no.1 is mother of deceased and petitioners no.2 is wife and petitioner no.3 is son of deceased Ramswarth. It has been stated by PW1 that after the death of her husband they have no other source of income. The evidence adduced by the petitioner has gone unrebutted on this point. Petitioner no.1 being mother, petitioner no..2 being wife and petitioner no. 3 being son/legal heirs of deceased are entitled to get compensation for the death of the deceased in the ill-fated accident. Therefore total family members dependent on the income of deceased are three. 20.The petitioners have not placed on record any document to support the allegations that deceased used to earn Rs.11,000/- per month. In other words he was doing labour work and could have earned sufficient monthly income to maintain his family consisting him i.e. his wife, mother and children. Therefore, the income of the deceased was certainly more than a male casual labourer. Accordingly, for the purpose of assessing the compensation, the income of deceased is assessed at Rs.8,000/- per month. In view of authority titled as Munna Parvati etc vs Vinay etc) 12 Lal Jain vs Vipin Kumar Sharma 2015(6) SCC 347 and Shri Ram General Insurance Company Limited vs Karnail Kaur and others 2015-4, PLR 324, the deceased being of 43 years of age at the time of his death, 30% income earned by him is to be added as prospects of future income and considering the age of deceased as 43 years the total income of the deceased after adding 30% of the income comes to Rs.10,400/- per month i.e. 1,24,800/- per year. It has also been laid down by the Apex Court in Smt. Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transportation Corporation and another 2009 (3) PLR 22, where the deceased was married, the deduction towards personal and living expenses of the deceased should be one third where the number of dependant family members is 2 to 3, one fourth where the number of the dependant family members is 4 to 6 and one fifth where the number of dependant family members exceeds six. Therefore, after deducting one third of the income of the deceased as her personal expenses, contribution towards his family comes to Rs. 83200/-per year. As per law laid down in Smt. Sarla Verma and others’ case 2009-3, PLR 22 the multiplier to be applied is of 14. So, the compensation after applying multiplier of 14 comes to 83200x14=11,64800/- 21.The petitioners might have suffered some expenses on the last rites of the deceased besides suffering loss of estate. As per law laid down in Rajesh and others vs Rajbir Singh and others 2013 Parvati etc vs Vinay etc) 13 (3) RCR (Civil) 170(SC), petitioner's wife is awarded an amount of Rs.1,00,000/- towards loss of consortium. The petitioners are further allowed Rs.25,000/- towards funeral expenses and Rs 1,00,000/- are granted for love and affection to the children of the deceased. Thus, the total amount payable to the petitioners comes to Rs. 13,89,800/- . Issue no.2 is decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUE No.3 22. To substantiate this issue, no evidence was led by respondent No.3 insurance company to prove that offending vehicle was being driven by respondent No.1 in contravention of the terms and conditions of insurance policy. Copy of driving licence Ex.R-6 was produced, from which, it stands proved on record that Ex.R-6 was issued by Licencing Authority, and is valid for driving the motorcycle, motorcyle, LMV etc and as such the said driving licence Ex.R6 is meant for driving vehicle.

Joshi Ahlawat counsel for the petitioners Shri Narender Khatri counsel for respondent no.1 and 2 Shri Vijay Kumar, counsel for respondent no. 3 UID No. HR0128 Manju and others Vs. Shakil Khan and others UID No. HR0128 AWARD This claim petition has been filed under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, seeking compensation on account of death of Virender Mohan in motor vehicular accident which occurred on 22.10.2015 at about 07.00 p.m. due to rash and negligent driving of the vehicle truck bearing registration no. HR-67-B-5635 (hereinafter referred to as the offending vehicle) by respondent No.1, which was owned by respondent No.2 and insured with respondent no. 3. 2.Brief facts of the case are that on 22.10.2015, deceased Virender Mohan along with his brother Surender Mohan and nephew Shubham was coming from Gohana to their village on their motor-cycles and when they reached near Gohana Kharkhoda Road at about 07.30 p.m. the offending vehicle bearing registration no. HR-67-B-5635, driven by respondent no. 1 in rash and negligent manner came from back side and struck against the motorcycle No. HR11F-9631 of Virender Mohan from behind, due to which, the deceased fell down on the road and sustained grievous injuries on his person. Deceased was shifted to PGI Khanpur where he succumbed to his injuries. The matter was reported to police vide First Information Report No. 361 dated 23.10.2015 for the offence under Sections 279, 304-A of Indian Penal Code at police station Sadar Gohana against respondent No.1. The accident was caused only due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 1. UID No. HR01282 Manju and others Vs. Shakil Khan and others UID No. HR0128 It is alleged that the deceased was a teacher in Baba Chhotu Nath Sr. Sec. School, Gohana Road, Sisana and he was getting salary of Rs. 10,000/- per month. He was the only bread earner of his family and the petitioners were dependent upon his earnings. Petitioners have claimed the amount of Rs. 50 lacs as compensation. 3.On notice respondents appeared through their respective counsels and resisted the claim petition by filing separate written statements. 4.Respondent no. 1 and 2 in their written statement denied the accident in totality and pleaded that no such accident took place with the offending vehicle and respondent no. 1 has been falsely involved in the above accident by the police and a false case has been registered against respondent no. 1. It is denied that the petitioners are entitled to compensation, however in alternative it is pleaded that if, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the accident took place with the offending vehicle, which was duly insured with respondent No. 3, it will be for the said respondent to pay the compensation and a prayer for dismissal of the petition is made. 5.Respondent no. 3 – SBI General Insurance Company Limited in its written statement took preliminary objections on the grounds that the vehicle, which was being driven in violation of the Motor Vehicles Act and against the terms and conditions of the Insurance policy and that UID No. HR01283 Manju and others Vs. Shakil Khan and others UID No. HR0128 respondent no.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence to drive the alleged vehicle at the time of alleged accident. On merits also respondent no.3 denied the case of petitioners and pleaded that respondent no. 3 is not liable to indemnify the award as the deceased and the driver of the offending vehicle were negligent and pleading further that the claim is exorbitant and imaginary, the dismissal of the petition has been prayed for. 6.From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed on 21.12.2016 - 1.Whether the accident took place on 22.10.2015 at about 07.30 p.m. within the jurisdiction of Police Station Sadar Gohana, due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle bearing registration no. HR-67B-5635 by its driver respondent no. 1, resulting into death of Virender Mohan, as alleged ? OPP 2.Whether the petitioners are entitled to get the compensation? If so to what amount and from whom? OPP 3.Whether the respondent no.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence on the date and time of alleged accident? If so to what effect? OPR 4.Relief. 7.In evidence, petitioners examined petitioner Surender Mohan as PW1, Manju as PW2 and Jagjeet Singh as PW3. Thereafter, learned counsel for petitioners closed the evidence after tendering documents. UID No. HR01284 Manju and others Vs. Shakil Khan and others UID No. HR0128 8.Learned counsel for respondent no. 1 and 2 tendered documents Ex. R1 to Ex. R7 in evidence and thereafter closed evidence on behalf of respondent no.1 and 2. 9. Learned counsel for respondent no. 3 tendered documents Ex. R8 to Ex. R12 in evidence and thereafter, closed evidence on behalf of learned counsel for respondent no. 3. 10.I have appraised the evidence on record, material circumstances of the case and the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the parties at length. My findings on the aforesaid issues along with the reasons thereof are as under - ISSUE No.1 11.Petitioner Manju as PW2 filed her affidavit Ex.PW2/A wherein she deposed that her husband Virender Mohan died in the motor vehicle accident that took place on 22.10.2015. 12.PW1 Surender Mohan, the eye witness has corroborated the statement of PW2 and he has completely deposed on the lines of the petition. 13.From the testimony of the witnesses and the documents, learned counsel for petitioners prayed for deciding this issue in favour of petitioners. It is argued that respondent no.1 has not even dared to appear in the witness box to substantiate his written statement on oath before the court. It is pointed out that since the testimony of witnesses and the claim UID No. HR01285 Manju and others Vs. Shakil Khan and others UID No. HR0128 remained unrebutted, this issue is liable to be decided in favour of petitioners. 14.The FIR Ex.P1 mentions all the particulars necessary to identify the offending vehicle and for proving the cause of accident. The number of the offending vehicle is clearly mentioned in the first information report. Even otherwise, respondent no. 1 has not stepped into witness box to state his case on oath and to offer himself for cross examination. On this account, an adverse inference has to be drawn against respondent no.1. There is also no evidence on the file that respondent no. 1 ever filed any protest petition before the higher authorities against his false implication or against false involvement of the vehicle and his silence for such a long period also goes against him. The only irresistible conclusion that can be drawn is that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent no.1 while driving the offending vehicle. In holding so, the reliance is placed upon 2008(2) RCR (Civil) 72 Sudama Devi Vs. Kewal Ram. 15.The copy of report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex. P4 is also available on record, which shows that respondent no. 1 is facing trial for causing the said accident. It has been held in 1993(2) PLR 109 Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Sham and others that where the driver of the offending vehicle is facing trial for causing injuries to the petitioner by way UID No. HR01286 Manju and others Vs. Shakil Khan and others UID No. HR0128 of rash and negligent driving, it is safe to hold that accident took place due to this rash and negligent driving. 16. The post mortem report of the deceased and death certificate are also proved as Ex.P2 and Ex. P3 respectively and the contents of post mortem report have also remained unrebutted as no evidence to prove to the contrary has been led by the respondents. From the post mortem report, it is established that the deceased died as a result of injuries suffered by him in the accident. 17.In view of the evidence led by the petitioners on the file and the fact that the first information report has been registered against respondent no.1 for causing death of Virender Mohan by his rash and negligent driving, it is conclusively proved that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUE No.2 18.The stand of petitioners and as stated by PW2 Manju, the widow of deceased is that the deceased was working as teacher in Baba Chhotu Nath Sr. Sec. School and he was getting salary of Rs. 10,000/- per month. Petitioners have also examined PW3 Jagjeet Singh as PW3 who deposed that deceased Virender Mohan was working as Clerk in their school from 01.01.2015 to 21.10.2015 and he used to draw Rs. 10,000/- per month as salary and he has proved the salary certificate as Ex. UID No. HR01287 Manju and others Vs. Shakil Khan and others UID No. HR0128 PW3/A. Petitioners have also proved appointment letter as Ex. PW3/B. However, in the appointment letter issued on 23.12.2014, the salary of deceased is mentioned as Rs. 6000/- per month and PW3 has also admitted this fact in his cross-examination. Petitioners have not placed on record any salary slip issued by the school to show that the deceased was being paid the salary as recorded in salary certificate Ex PW3/A. Thus, the evidence of petitioners does not establish that the deceased was earning the income as alleged and the evidence of petitioners cannot be relied upon to assess such income of deceased Virender Mohan as pleaded by petitioners. However, the accident took place on 21.10.2015 and during those days even labourers used to earn Rs. 6,000/- per month as minimum wages and thus income of deceased is assessed as Rs.6,000/- per month. In the post mortem report, the age of deceased is recorded as 38 years. Any proof to the contrary has not been produced. Hence the age of deceased is taken as 38 years. In view of law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Rajesh and others versus Rajbir Singh and others, 2013(3) R C R (SC) 170 , 50% of income is to be added as future prospects. Therefore, after adding the same, the monthly income of deceased comes to Rs. 9,000/- and his annual income comes to Rs. 1,08,000/-. Petitioners are the widow, minor children and mother of deceased and the deceased has left behind only these four dependents. 1/4th of income has to be deducted towards personal expenses of deceased in view of law laid down in 2009 ACJ 1298 Smt. Sarla UID No. HR01288 Manju and others Vs. Shakil Khan and others UID No. HR0128 Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another and the annual loss of dependency comes to Rs. 81,000/-. 19.The deceased was aged about 38 years and multiplier of 15 has to be applied in view of law laid down in Smt. Sarla Verma’s case (supra). 20.Therefore total loss of dependency would be Rs. 81,000/- x 15 which comes to Rs. 12,15,000/-. No amount of compensation can fill the vacuum in the life of petitioners due to sudden death of Virender Mohan but the amount of compensation will help them to sustain their life. In addition to this petitioners are also entitled to a sum of Rs.25,000/- on account of funeral expenses and Rs.5,000/- towards loss of estate which takes the compensation to Rs. 12,45,000/-. Petitioner Manju being widow of deceased is also held entitled to a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- towards consortium. The total compensation comes to Rs. 13,45,000/-(Thirteen Lakhs Forty Five Thousand only) . 21.The point now arises as to who is liable to pay the compensation. Learned counsel for respondent no. 3 has argued that respondent no. 1 was not having a valid and effective driving licence. He also argued that the driving licence Ex. R1 of respondent no. 1 has been issued from Nagaland and as per information received under RTI, the driving licence issued to respondent no. 1 should be treated as cancelled w.e.f December, 2014 and thus, the driving licence of respondent no. 1 UID No. HR01289 Manju and others Vs. Shakil Khan and others UID No. HR0128 was not a genuine document and therefore, there is no liability of respondent no. 3 to pay the compensation. 22.The driving licence of respondent is proved as Ex. R1 and as per information Ex. R12, the driving licences other than in the Smart Card Format be treated as cancelled w.e.f. December, 2014. This information issued by the Transport Officer, Nagaland however, as per this information given, the driving licence no. 22671/TSG/PROF/2010 was issued in the name of respondent no. 1 on 02.11.2010 and valid upto 14.12.2016, whereas the accident took place on 22.10.2015. There is no evidence that the driving licence Ex. R1 was found as false or fabricated. Even if, the driving licence of respondent no. 1 was not found in Smart Card Format, the same does not establish that respondent no. 1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence. Therefore, with the evidence, it is established that respondent no. 1 was holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident. 23.The vehicle is registered in the name of respondent no.2 and the registration certificate is proved as Ex.R4. The vehicle was insured with respondent no. 3 and the insurance policy is proved as Ex.R8. Hence, insurer i.e. respondent no. 3 – SBI General Insurance Company Limited also cannot escape from its liability. Consequently, all the respondent no. 1 to 3 are held liable jointly and severally to pay the compensation to the petitioners. Accordingly, this issue stands decided in favour of petitioners and against respondents. UID No. HR012810 Manju and others Vs. Shakil Khan and others UID No. HR0128 ISSUE NO.3 24.The onus to prove this issue was upon the respondents. In view of findings on the preceding issues and the evidence on record, it is established that respondent no.1 was holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident. Hence, this issue has become redundant. ISSUE No.4 (Relief) 25. In view of findings on the preceding issues, the petition stands partly allowed with costs. Petitioners are awarded a sum of Rs. 13,45,000/-(Thirteen Lakhs Forty Five Thousand only) as compensation along with interest @ 7 per cent per annum from the date of filing of the petition till realization payable by respondents no. 1 to 3. Out of the compensation amount, Rs.6,00,000/- shall go to petitioner no.1 Manju, the widow of deceased, Rs. 4,00,000/- shall go to petitioner no. 2 and 3 in equal share, who are the minor children of the deceased and the remaining amount Rs. 3,45,000/- shall go to petitioner no. 4, who is the mother of the deceased. On realization of the amount, fifty per cent amount of the share of petitioner no. 1 and 4 shall be paid in cash and remaining fifty percent amount of their share shall be deposited in the FDRs to be opened in their name in some nationalized bank for a period of two years fetching maximum rate of interest. A note be given to the effect that the FDRs shall be released on the expiry of period of two years without any formal order of this Tribunal. The share of minor petitioner No.2 and 3 shall be deposited in some beneficial scheme of fixed deposit in a nationalized UID No. HR012811 Manju and others Vs. Shakil Khan and others UID No. HR0128 bank through his mother i.e., petitioner no.1 being natural guardian but will be paid to them only on their attaining the age of majority with a note that no loan shall be advanced against the fixed deposits.

Krishan & others 6 D.O.D. 26.02.2016 10.The petitioner tendered the documents Ex.P 107 to Ex.P131 in his additional evidence. The respondents did not produce any evidence in rebuttal to the additional evidence of petitioner. 11.I have heard learned counsels appearing on behalf of both sides and perused the record carefully. My issue-wise findings along with reasons are as under:- ISSUE NO. 1: 12.Petitioner Suresh has stated on oath that the accident in question was caused by respondent No. 1 by driving the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. PW2 Shankar has also corroborated his statement. Both of them have further stated that they sustained injuries in the accident in question. The petitioners have also placed on record the copy of FIR Ex.P1 which shows that the case regarding the accident in question was registered against the respondent No. 1 for causing the accident in question by driving offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. Although the respondent No. 1 has stated in his statement as RW1 that the accident took placed due to negligence of claimant, but he has admitted in his cross-examination that FIR was IN MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT, PRESIDED OVER BY SUSHIL KUMAR, ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, SONEPAT. Claim Petition No. 630 of 2015 Suresh Vs . Krishan & others 7 D.O.D. 26.02.2016 registered against him and case was also pending in the court. Therefore, it may be assumed that after investigation of the case, the police filed challan against respondent No. 1 for causing the accident in question. It has been held by the Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in case of Gurdeep Kaur Vs. Tarsem Singh 2008(2) RCR © 774 and Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Shyam 1993 (2) PLR 109 that if driver is being tried on account of rash and negligent driving, it is prima-facie safe to presume that accident occurred on account of rash and negligent driving of the driver. Since the respondent No. 1 has admitted that the case against him was pending in the court, it may be presumed that he was being tried for causing the accident in question by driving the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. Therefore, it is concluded that the accident in question took place due to negligence of respondent No. 1 and the petitioner sustained injuries in the accident. Hence, issue No. 1 is proved in favour of petitioner. 13.The petitioner has claimed compensation of 7,00,000/- ₹ from the respondents alleging that the respondent No. 1 being driver, respondent No. 2 being owner and respondent No. 3 being insurer of the IN MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT, PRESIDED OVER BY SUSHIL KUMAR, ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, SONEPAT.

The petitioner has deposed in his statement as PW1 that he spent more than ₹ 1,00,000/- on his treatment and he also suffered loss of income because he could not work during the period of treatment. He has further stated that his marriage was solemnized about 8/9 months before the accident and his marriage life was affected badly because of this accident.

Thereafter, respondents closed their evidence vide separate statement. 17.No evidence in rebuttal evidence was led by the petitioners. 18.I have gone through the case file very carefully and minutely and heard the arguments put-forth by both the sides. My issue-wise findings are as under - ISSUE No. 1 : 19. Onus to prove this issue was upon the petitioners. Initiating arguments, learned counsel for the claimants/petitioners vehemently IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 21 contended that petitioners Anita, Rakhi, Mother of petitioner Kajal namely Tarawati, mother of petitioner Deepak namely Sapna, petitioner Pooja and petitioner Prem who appeared as PW1 to PW6 respectively categorically deposed that on 23.02.2015 when deceased Vijaypal, Vimlesh and Asha and injured Prem, Kajal, Deepak and Pooja were traveling in van bearing registration No. DL-5CK-4669 and had reached near Murthal over-bridge in the area of Police Station, Murthal, Sonepat, respondent No. 1 who was driving the offending vehicle i.e. Gas Tanker bearing registration No. HR- 38E-6594 in a rash and negligent manner applied sudden breaks as a result of which Maruti Van dashed into the tanker. He further urged that statements of afore-mentioned witnesses are supported by FIR Ex. P17, police report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex. P18, PMR reports Ex. P1, Ex. P2 and Ex. P16, discharge cards Ex. P3, Ex. P6, Ex. P9 and Ex. P15 and medical bills Ex. P4, Ex. P5, Ex. P7, Ex. P8, Ex. P10 to Ex. P14. Thus, he submitted that it is well established that the accident in question was caused due to rash and negligent driving of Tanker bearing registration No. HR- 38E-6594 by respondent No. 1 and while passengers in the Maruti Van namely Vijaypal, Vimlesh, Asha died due to the injuries suffered by them in the accident, other passengers namely Prem, Kajal, Deepak and Pooja suffered multiple injuries. IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 22 20.On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents No.1 & 2 vehemently argued that no accident took place with Tanker bearing registration No. HR-38E-6594 and respondent No. 1 was falsely implicated in the criminal case bearing FIR No. 84 dated 24.02.2015, under Sections 279, 337, 38, 304A IPC, P.S. Murthal. Hence, prayed that all the claim petitions are liable to be dismissed. 21.I have given thoughtful consideration to the arguments put forth by both sides. It is pertinent to note that PW2 Rakhi and PW5 Pooja who had sustained injuries in the accident in question and PW6 Prem who is eye- witness to the accident being passenger in the accidental van specifically deposed that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of Tanker bearing registration No. HR-38E-6594 by respondent No.1 because he applied sudden breaks as a result of which the Maruti Van which was behind the tanker dashed against the tanker. It is also noteworthy that the FIR Ex. P17 regarding the accident was registered on the basis of statement of one eye-witness Amit on the same day and it is recorded in the FIR that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of the above-said tanker. It is further significant to note that during investigation the police found the version of the FIR as correct and filed final report against respondent No. 1 which is Ex. P18. It is also worthwhile to note that IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 23 respondent No.1 did not step into the witness box to rebut the version of the claimants/ petitioners. At this juncture, I may also observe that it is well settled law that proceedings before the MACT are of summary nature and standard of proof in such proceedings is neither preponderance of probabilities as required in a civil case nor proof beyond reasonable doubt as required in criminal trial and for such proceedings the documents prepared by the police may be taken on their face value. For this purpose, reference with advantage is made to law laid down by our Hon'ble Division Bench in “Paramjit Kaur and others versus Nahar Singh and Others” FAO 8848 of 2014 (O&M) and “United India Insurance Company Ltd. Versus Nahar Singh and Others FAO No. 9115 of 2014 (O&M). In given scenario, I am of the considered opinion that it is well proved for the purpose of instant proceedings that the accident in question was caused by respondent No. 1 while driving tanker bearing registration No. HR-38E- 6594 in a rash and negligent manner. 22.It is further important to note that PW2 Rakhi and PW5 Pooja who have sustained injuries in the accident in question and PW6 Prem who is eye-witness categorically testified that Vijaypal, Vimlesh and Asha died due to injuries suffered in the accident while Pooja, Rakhi, Kajal and Deepak suffered injuries. It is also important to note that their depositions IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 24 are corroborated from post-mortem reports Ex. P1, Ex. P2 and Ex. P16 and discharge card with medical bills of injured Rakhi Ex. P3 to Ex. P5, discharge card read with medical bills of Kajal Ex. P6 to Ex. P8, discharge card read with medical bills of Deepak Ex. P9 to Ex.P11 and medical bills and discharge card of Pooja Ex. P12 to Ex. P15. Consequently, it is cogently established that while Vijaypal, Vimlesh and Asha died due to the injuries suffered in the accident, minor Kajal, Rakhi, Pooja and Deepak suffered injuries in the accident. 23.In view of the above discussion, this issue is decided in favour of the claimants/ petitioners and against the respondents. I SSUE No. 2(in all claim petitions) - 24.The onus to prove this issue was upon the claimants/ petitioners. In his arguments learned counsel for the claimants/ petitioners submitted that in view of the statements of Anita, Rakhi, Mother of injured Kajal namely Tarawati, mother of petitioner Deepak namely Sapna, petitioner Pooja and petitioner Prem who appeared as PW1 to PW6 respectively regarding the income and age of the deceased namely Vijaypal, Vimlesh and Asha and injureds Rakhi, Kajal, Pooja and Deepak, the compensation prayed for by the claimants/ petitioners are just and reasonable and may kindly be granted. IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 25 25.On the contrary, learned counsel for the respondents stated that the compensation demanded by the claimants/ petitioners is highly excessive and exorbitant. Furthermore, learned counsel for the respondent No. 3 urged that respondent No. 1 who was driver of the offending tanker bearing registration No. HR-38E-6594 is having two driving licence i.e. one issued by Licencing Authority, RTA, Palwal Ex. RW1/A & D, which was initially valid upto 06.01.2014 and subsequently, renewed from 01.07.2016 till 30.06.2019 while the other driving licence Ex. R1/1 was issued by Regional Transport Officer, Kohima, Nagaland and was valid from 17.11.2014 to 16.11.2017. According to him, the driving licence of respondent No. 1 Ex. R1 is fake and has been procured and produced with mala-fide intention to transfer the liability to pay compensation upon the Insurance Company. He referred to law laid down by our own Hon'ble High Court in Oriental Insurance Com. Ltd. Vs. Nahar Singh and Others FAO NO. 9115 of 2014 (O& M) D.O.D. 21.02.2017. Therefore, he contended that in the circumstances, respondent No. 3 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimants/ petitioners. 26. I have given thoughtful consideration to the submissions made by both sides. As regards the amount of compensation payable in claim petition No. 356 of 2017 titled as ' Anita etc. versus Sant Lal & Others', it IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 26 is pertinent to note that claimants have claimed a compensation of 50 Lacs ₹ on account of death of Vijay Pal in the accident in question. It is further imperative to note that even though, claimant Anita has stated in her affidavit Ex. PW1/A that deceased Vijay Pal was mason by profession and was earning 20,000/- per month but neither any independent witness in ₹ support of such statement has been examined nor any documentary proof to substantiate the said claim has been produced. Accordingly, the income of deceased Vijaypal at the time of his death i.e. on 24.02.2015 can be reasonably inferred at the rate equivalent to minimum wages prevalent at that time i.e. 6,000/- per month. It is also noteworthy that as per the ₹ claimants/petitioners, deceased Vijaypal has left behind a wife, three minor children, father and mother. It is further relevant to mention that father is a second class heir. Moreover, he is supposed to have his own income and there is nothing on file except the bald statement of PW1 Anita that father of deceased Vijaypal was dependent upon him. It is also important to note that in Sarla Verma & Others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & others, 2009 (3) RCR (Civil) 77 , the Hon'ble apex Court ruled that “ Further, subject to evidence to the contrary, the father is likely to have his own income and will not be considered as a dependent and the mother alone will be considered as a dependent” . Thus, the father of deceased Vijaypal IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 27 cannot be considered as dependent on the deceased. Accordingly, there were five dependents on deceased Vijaypal. Hence, 1/4th income of the deceased is liable to be deducted towards personal expenses as per decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Smt. Sarla Verma's case (Supra) . Therefore, the loss of income comes to 54,000/- per annum. At this juncture, I may also observe ₹ that as per post-mortem report , the age of deceased Vijaypal was about 40 years. Therefore, the multiplier of 15 would be applicable. Resultantly, the loss of dependency comes to 54,000/- x 15 = 8,10,000/- (Rupees Eight ₹ Lacs and Ten Thousand Only). 27.Another important aspect of the matter is that since deceased Vijaypal was self employed an addition of 40% of the income is permissible under the Head “Future Prospects” , which comes to 3,24,000/-. ₹ 28.In addition to the above said- amount, the claimants/ petitioners are further entitled to a mount of 15,000/- each ₹ towards loss of estate and funeral expenses of deceased. Moreover, claimants are also entitled to additional amount of 40,000/- under the head of ₹ loss of consortium . Therefore, the total amount of compensation thus comes to 12,04,000/- ₹ out of which claimant No. 1 will be entitled to 40% of the total amount of compensation being widow of deceased Vijaypal while other claimants No. 2 to 4 being sons and daughters of the deceased and claimant No. 6 being IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 28 mother of the deceased are entitled to 15% each of the total amount of compensation. 29.In claim petition No. 357, titled as “Prem & Others Versus Sant Lal & Others” the claimants/ petitioners have claimed a compensation of 50 Lacs on account of death of Vimlesh in the accident in question. In₹ this regard, it is imperative to note that even though, claimant Prem has stated in his affidavit Ex. PW6/A that deceased Vimlesh was labourer by profession and was earning 15,000/- per month but neither any ₹ independent witness in support of such statement has been examined nor any documentary proof to substantiate the said claim has been produced. Accordingly, the income of deceased Vimlesh at the time of her death i.e. on 24.02.2015 can be reasonably inferred at the rate equivalent to minimum wages prevalent at that time i.e. 6,000/- per month. It is also noteworthy ₹ that as per the claimants/petitioners, deceased Vimlesh has left behind her husband and four children. Accordingly, there were five dependents on deceased Vimlesh. Hence, 1/4th income of the deceased is liable to be deducted towards personal expenses as per decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Smt. Sarla Verm's case (Supra) . Therefore, the loss of income comes to 54,000/- per annum. At this juncture, I may also observe that as ₹ per post-mortem report , the age of deceased Vimlesh was about 40 years. IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 29 Therefore, the multiplier of '15' would be applicable. Resultantly, the loss of dependency comes to 54,000/- x 15 = 8,10,000/- (Rupees Eight Lacs and ₹ Ten Thousand Only). 30.Another important aspect of the matter is that since deceased Vimlesh was self employed an addition of 40% of the income is permissible under the Head “ Future Prospects” which comes to 3,24,000/-. ₹ 31.In addition to the above said- amount, the claimants/ petitioners are further entitled to a mount of 15,000/- each towards ₹ loss of estate and funeral expenses of the deceased. Moreover, claimants are also entitled to additional amount of 40,000/- under the head of ₹ loss of consortium . Therefore, the total amount of compensation comes to 12,04,000/- out of ₹ which claimant No. 1 will be entitled to 40% of the total amount of compensation being husband of deceased Vimlesh while other claimants being sons and daughter of the deceased are entitled to 15% each of the total amount of compensation. 32.In claim petition No. 358, titled as “Anita Versus Sant Lal & Others” it is important to note that as per the case set-up by the claimant/ petitioner, deceased Asha was a student of 5th standard at the time of her death. Thus, her notional income can be taken as 30,000/- per annum and ₹ multiplier of “'15” would be applicable. In this regard, reliance is placed IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs.

Sant Lal & others. 30 upon the law laid down by our own Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Krishan Gopal and others Versus Lala and others 2013 (4) RCR (Civil) 276. Resultantly, the loss of income comes to 30,000/- x 15 = 4,50,000/- ₹ (Rupees Four Lacs and Fifty Thousand Only). 33. In addition to the above said amount, the claimant/ petitioner is further entitled to amount of 15,000/- towards ₹ loss of estate and funeral expenses of the deceased. Thus, total compensation comes to 4, ₹ 80,000/-. 34. In claim petition No. 359, titled as “Deepak Versus Sant Lal & Others” it is worthwhile to note that injured Deepak has claimed a compensation of Five Lacs on account of injuries suffered by him in the ₹ accident in question. It is further significant to note that the discharge card of injured Deepak is Ex. P9 wherein it is recorded that he remained admitted in PGIMS, Rohtak from 24.02.2015 to 26.02.2015. It is also relevant to note that the medical bills of the injured in the sum of 14,614/- and 6709/- ₹ ₹ respectively have been proved as Ex. P10 and Ex. P11. Therefore, I am of the considered view that claimant Deepak is entitled to 21,323/- under the ₹ Head “Medical Expenses” . 35.Furthermore, since the accident in question occurred on National Highway within the jurisdiction of District Sonepat and the IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT.

Moreover, as discussed above the injured remained admitted in PGIMS, Rohtak for two days. Accordingly, he must have spent some amount on special diet. Therefore, I am of the considered view that in the absence of any proof of the amount actually spent by the claimant on special diet and transportation, the sum can be reasonably assessed in view of nature of injuries suffered by the claimant as 3,000/-. ₹ 36. It is also important to mention that in view of nature of injuries suffered by him as mentioned in the discharge card Ex. P9, the claimant is also entitled to a reasonable amount under the Head “Pain and Sufferings” which in my opinion comes to 8,000/-. Thus, the total amount of ₹ compensation comes to 32, 323/-. ₹ 37. In claim petition No. 360 titled as “Rakhi Versus Sant Lal & Others” it is worthwhile to note that injured Rakhi has claimed a compensation of Ten Lacs on account of injuries suffered by her in the ₹ accident in question. It is also important to note that the discharge card of injured Rakhi is Ex. P3 wherein it is recorded that she remained admitted in PGIMS, Rohtak from 24.02.2015 to 26.02.2015.

Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 32 respectively have been proved as Ex. P4 and Ex. P5. Therefore, I am of the considered view that claimant Rakhi is entitled to 36,855/- under the Head ₹ “Medical Expenses”. 38.It is also pertinent to note that since the accident in question occurred on National Highway within the jurisdiction of District Sonepat and the claimant was treated in PGIMS, Rohtak, it can be safely assumed that the claimant would have incurred expenses on transportation. Moreover, as already discussed above the claimant remained admitted in PGIMS, Rohtak for two days. Accordingly, she must have spent some amount on special diet. Therefore, I am of the considered view that in the absence of any proof of the amount actually spent by the claimant on special diet and transportation, the sum can be reasonably assessed in view of nature of injuries of the claimant as 8,000/-. ₹ 39. It is also important to mention that as per discharge card Ex. P3, the injured suffered three multiple fractures. Consequently, in view of nature of injuries suffered by her, the claimant is also entitled to a reasonable amount under the Head “Pain and Sufferings” which in my opinion comes to 25,000/-. ₹ 40.At this juncture, I may also observe that claimant Rakhi when appeared into witness-box as PW2 has stated that at the time of accident, she IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT.

However, neither any independent witness has been examined nor any documentary evidence has been led in order to substantiate the said claim. So, no amount is granted to claimant Rakhi on account of loss of earnings. Hence, the total amount of compensation comes to 69,855/-.₹ 41. In claim petition No. 361 titled as “Kajal Versus Sant Lal & Others” it is worthwhile to note that injured Kajal has claimed a compensation of Five Lacs on account of injuries suffered by her in the ₹ accident in question. It is further noteworthy to note that the discharge card of injured Kajal is Ex. P6 wherein it is recorded that she remained admitted in PGIMS, Rohtak from 24.02.2015 to 26.02.2015. It is also relevant to note that the medical bills of the injured in the sum of 20,820/- and 151/- ₹ ₹ respectively have been proved as Ex. P7 and Ex. P8. Therefore, I am of the considered view that claimant Kajal is entitled to 20,971/- under the Head ₹ “Medical Expenses”. 42.It is further imperative to note that since the accident in question occurred on National Highway within the jurisdiction of District Sonepat and the claimant was treated in PGIMS, Rohtak, it can be safely assumed that the claimant would have incurred expenses on transportation.

Thus, the total amount of compensation comes to 87,093/-.₹ ₹ 47.Now, the question is regarding who is liable to pay compensation. In this regard, it is imperative to note that respondent No.1, who was driver of the offending vehicle at the time of accident is having two IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 36 driving licences i.e. driving licence Ex. RW1/B & D which was initially valid from 07.12.2005 to 06.01.2014 for transport vehicles and which has been subsequently renewed for the period 01.07.2016 to 30.06.2019 as per deposition of RW2 Rajender Singh, Transport Inspector, RTA, Palwal and driving licence Ex. R1/1 which is issued by Regional Transport Officer, Kohima, Nagaland which was valid from 17.11.2014 to 16.11.2017. It is further significant to mention that keeping in view the fact that respondent No. 1 has two licences, this Tribunal summoned the file of criminal case regarding FIR No. 85 of 2015, under Sections 279, 337, 338, 304A, IPC, Police Station, Murthal so as to ascertain which driving licence was handed over to the police during investigation of that case and a perusal of the file of the criminal case revealed that during the investigation, a copy of driving licence Ex. RW1/B & D was handed over to the police as the original of the same was already placed on the file of case bearing FIR No. 218 dated 01.08.2013, under sections 279 and 304 A IPC, P.S. Kharkhoda. Hence, it is crystal clear that respondent No. 1 relied upon driving licence issued by Licencing Authority, Palwal in the criminal case registered against him regarding the accident in question. However, during instant proceedings, he alongwith owner of the offending vehicle have relied upon driving licence Ex. R1/1 which is issued by the Regional Transport Officer, Kohima, IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 37 Nagland. As already discussed above, the driving licence Ex. RW1/B & D was not valid on the day of accident. At this juncture, I may also observe that the possibility of obtaining a driving licence by respondent No. 1 from the State of Nagaland after expiry of his driving licence Ex. RW1/B & D for future purposes is ruled out from the fact that he got his licence Ex. RW1/B & D renewed from 01.07.2016 to 30.06.2019 because if respondent No. 1 had taken licence Ex. R1/1 from the State of Nagaland in view of the fact that his earlier driving licence Ex. RW1/B & D had expired, he would not have got his said licence renewed during the validity of licence Ex. R1/1. It is further important to note that respondent No. 1 is local resident of Palwal. Thus, there was no reason for him to apply and get his driving licence from the State of Nagaland. In similar circumstances, our own Hon'ble High Court in case titled as Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. Versus Nahar Singh and Other's case (Supra) while taking note of Section 6 (I) of the M.V. Act 1998, which prohibits any person from holding more than one driving licence held “that the licence produced by the driver subsequently had been issued from Nagaland, which is not the ordinary place of residence of the driver, therefore, the Court can take notice of this fact that the licence has been managed from a different area with a view to overcome the liability in such cases. The driver could not hold two licences and the IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs.

Therefore, the insurance company could not have been made liable.” 48.In these facts and circumstances of the case, it can be safely concluded that the insurance company-respondent No. 3 is not liable to indemnify the insured. Consequently, the respondent No.1, who was driver of the offending vehicle and respondent No. 2 who is the owner of the offending vehicle are held jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation to the claimants/ petitioners. However, respondent No. 3 i.e. insurance company shall be liable to pay the compensation to the claimants/ petitioners with liberty to recover the same from respondents No. 1 & 2 as per decision of Hon'ble apex Court in National Insurance Company Ltd. Versus Swaran Singh and others I (2004) CLT 1. 49. Both these issues stand disposed of in view of above observations accordingly. ISSUES No. 3 & 4 (in all petitions) - 50.In view of discussion above, it is held that insurance company shall deposit the amount of compensation in the first instance and shall remain at liberty to recover the said amount from the insured, either in the execution filed by the claimant himself/ herself or by moving separate IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT.

My findings on the aforesaid issues are as under: ISSUE No.1: 9.Legal heirs of deceased Kanwarpal filed the present petition under section 166 of the MV Act on the ground that due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle bearing registratio n no. HR 42D-0194 by its driver, the accident took place and wheel of the offending vehicle ran over the leg of injured Naresh and his leg was amputated and he become 100% disabled. In order to get compensation under section 166 of MV Act, petitioner is required to prove the fact that respondent no.1 was driving the offending vehicle bearing registration no. HR42D- 0194 in a rash and negligent manner. The main question is whether the offending vehicle was involved in the accident. The present case was registered on the statement of PW1 petitioner Naresh, who is also eye witness of the alleged accident. He deposed that on that day he was going to Haridwar with Kanwar Pal on motorcycle. Due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle no. HR 42D-0194 by respondent no.1, accident took place in which Kanwarpal lost his life and he sustained injuries being pillion rider on motorcycle being driven by Kanwar Pal. There is no ground to disbelieve the evidence of petitioner Naresh on oath, who is injured/ eye-witness of the accident. No evidence in rebuttal has been led by the respondents. It has not been disputed that case Kashmiri etc vs Mahender etc bearing MACP No. 213 of 2015 arising out of the same accident has been decided against respondents on 31.7.2017 holding that respondent no.1 was driving the vehicle in question at the time of accident in a rash and negligent manner. It is accordingly held in this case also. (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Naresh vs Mahinder Singh MACP No.191 of 2015 -5- Petitioner has sustained injuries and has proved disability certificate Ex PX also. 10 Had the accident not taken place due to the rash and negligent driving of the vehicle in question by the respondent no.1, then as a man of ordinary prudence, he might have approached the higher police authorities for cancellation of the case, but neither there are pleadings nor any evidence on record to show that any step was taken by him in this direction. This conduct on the part of the respondent no.1 of remaining silent goes against him. Even Respondent no.1 did not dare to appear in the witness-box to prove that the accident in question had not taken place due to his rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Under such circumstances, it would be prima-facie safe and prudent to conclude that the accident in question took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by the respondent no.1. 11.In view of the fore-going discussion, I am of the view that the accident in question resulting into injuries to petitioner took place due to the rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle No. HR 42D-10194 by the respondent no.1. Hence, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUE No. 2: 12 PW1 further testified that after the accident he was shifted to GH Sonepat from where he was referred to PGIMS Rohtak, where his right was amputated due to accident. Due to accident he became disabled and unable to do any work. He spent huge amount on his treatment medicines, special diet transportation etc. He produced on record Follow Up Medical record/bills , but the same are not exhibited. He has suffered physical as well mental agony besides suffering financial loss. Disability certificate is Ex (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Naresh vs Mahinder Singh MACP No.191 of 2015 -6- PX, according to which he became 70% disabled. 13. From the afore-discussed evidence, it stands proved that petitioner suffered injuries in the accident. It is in his statement on oath that the petitioner was got operated for the injuries suffered due to accident. His right leg was amputated. There is no rebuttal evidence of respondents. Therefore, there is no gainsaying that the petitioner is entitled to get compensation for the injuries sustained by him in the accident in question. 14. It is settled law that the Motor Vehicles Act is a welfare legislation. It has been promulgated to give relief to the injured of road side accidents. The petitioner must have undergone the agony of physical as well as mental pain and sufferings on account of the injuries received in the accident. No hard and fast rule can perhaps be laid down for assessing the compensation for the pain and sufferings undergone by an injured. However, the nature of the injuries, parts of the body involved, the period of hospitalization, the period required for recovery from the injuries and age and socio-economic conditions of the injured can be the guiding factors. 15 The disability of the petitioner has been proved on record by Ex PX disability certificate, as per which petitioner Naresh was having 70% permanent disability as permanent in nature on account of amputation of the right from knee joint. 16. The petitioner has not produced any documentary evidence in order to prove that he was earning Rs. 10,000/- per month. However, keeping in view the age of the petitioner, his income is assessed as Rs. 8000/- (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Naresh vs Mahinder Singh MACP No.191 of 2015 -7- per month. In the original disability certificate Ex.PX, age of the petitioner has been mentioned as 27 years. No evidence in rebuttal has been led by the respondents. However, keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case and considering the fact that the petitioner was 27 years old at the time of accident and that he was working as a labour, which is not possible as there is no chance to improve the disability , multiplier of 17 would be applicable as per the directive of the Honble Supreme given in Smt. Sarla Verma and others vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another 2009(3) RCR(Civil) 77. Considering 70% disability in the accident, the compensation amount comes as under:- 1. Compensation on account of : Rs. 11,42,400/- permanent partial disablement (8000 x 12 x17 x 70) to the extent of 70%. 100 2. Pain and Suffering : Rs. 25,000/- 4. Special Diet/Attendant : Rs. 25,000/- Charges/Hospitalization 5. Transportation Charge : Rs. 20,000/- -------------------------------- Total : Rs. 12,12,400 /- -------------------------------- Accordingly, the petitioner is held entitled to get a sum of Rs. 12,12,400/- as compensation along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum to be calculated thereon from the date of the filing of the petition till realization. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioner. ISSUE NO. 3 : 17. The respondent no.3 has raised the plea that the respondent no. 1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Naresh vs Mahinder Singh MACP No.191 of 2015 -8- accident. Perusal of copy of driving licence Ex R5 of respondent no.1 reveals that it was valid up 3.11.2015 for driving the vehicle MC, LMV , HMV and HTV only on the date of the accident i.e 9.2.2015. Therefore, it is clear that respondent no.1 was having valid driving license Ex R5 at the time of accident. 18.Now, question of liability of respondents to pay compensation. In the written statement respondent no.3 has not claimed that the vehicle in quesiton was not insured. Ex R2 is registration certificate of offending vehicle and Ex.R1 is insurance policy and Ex R3 is fitness certificae and it is clear that vehicle in question was insured with respondent no.3 on the date of accident . The respondent nos. 1 to 3 are held liable to pay the amount of compensation jointly as well as severally. As the vehicle was insured with respondent no.3 Insurance Company, respondent no.3 would be liable to make the payment of amount of compensation. RELIEF: 19 In view of my findings on the aforesaid issues, the claim petition is allowed in part with costs and a compensation of Rs.12,12,400 /- is awarded to the petitioner alongwith interest at the rate of 7.5% per cent per annum to be calculated thereon from the date of the petition till realization, if the amount is deposited within two months of passing the award, failing which respondents shall be liable to to pay interest at the rate of 9% p.a on the amount of compensation till payment. The respondents are directed to deposit the amount of compensation by way of cheque or bank draft in the name of petitioners in the bank account if copy of passbook is supplied by (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Naresh vs Mahinder Singh MACP No.191 of 2015 -9- the petitioners to the counsel for respondent no.3. If account number is not supplied by petitioners then the compensation would be deposited in this Tribunal by way of cheque or bank draft in the name of the petitioners. 20 On realization of compensation amount along with interest, 50% of the amount alongwith interest accrued thereupon be paid to petitioner in cash and remaining 50% be deposited in the shape of FDRs in his name in any nationalized bank, fetching maximum interest for a period of three years.

Shri Amit Khatri, Advocate for the respondents No.1and 2. Shri Vijay Rajpoot Adv,for the respondent no. 3. AWARD - Claiming an amount of Rs.25.00 lacs as compensation for the death of Kanwar Pal, caused in a motor vehicular accident, this claim petition has been filed by the claimants under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act. 2. The case of the petitioner, in brief, is that on 9.2.2015 deceased Kanwar Pal was going from village Chuchakwas to Haridwar on a motorcycle on which Naresh was pillion rider. At about 1.30.P.M the offending truck bearing registration no. HR42D-0194, being driven by its driver/ respondent no.1 in a rash and negligent manner, without blowing horn came from behind and hit his motorcycle, due to which Kanwar Pal and Naresh sustained multiple injuries and they were taken to Govt. Hospital. Kanwar Pal succumbed to the injuries on the way to Govt Hospital Sonepat. Naresh was referred to PGIMS Rohtak, after giving first aid. Injuries sustained by him resulted to permanent disability to Naresh. FIR No.64 dated 10.2.2015 under section 279,337 and 304 A of the Indian Penal Code was registered at police station Sonepat with regard to the accident. It has been pleaded that deceased was about 35 years of age and was earning Rs. 15,000/- per month, as he was working as meson. The claimants claim Rs.25.00 lac as compensation on account of death of Kanwarpal in a Motor Vehicle Act. 3.Notice of the claim petition was given to the respondents and the (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Kashmiri Devi etc vs Mahinder Singh MACP No.213 of 2015 -3- respondents no. 1 and 2 filed their joint written statement alleging that vehicle no. HR42D-0194 has been falsely implicated in this case. The accident was not caused due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. He has been falsely implicated. The amount shown to have been incurred on medical treatment is on higher side. Respondent no.3 is insurer of the vehicle. Ownership of vehicle of respondent no.2 has been admitted The vehicle was insured with respondent no.3 having valid policy. Other allegations are denied 4.Respondent no.3 filed a separate written statement denying the accident in question with truck bearing registration no. HR 43A-0194 and false implication of respondents no. 1 and 2. It has been alleged that the present claim petition has been filed in connivance with respondents no.1 and 2 to grab the compensation. It has been pleaded in additional pleas that respondent no.1 was not having valid and effective driving license at the time of accident. The insured of the truck in question has violated the terms and conditions of the policy on 9.2.2015 by plying the vehicle for non insurance purposes. The accident if proved took place due to sole negligence of the deceased. The amount claimed by the petitioners is excessive and exorbitant and has no relevancy to the alleged loss. Rest of the contentions were denied and prayer for dismissal of the petition has been made. 5. On the pleadings of the parties following issues were framed : 1.Whether the death of Kanwarpal son of Inder Pal was caused on account of motor vehicular accident dated 9.2.2015 at about 1.30.P.M near village Garhi, Mirakpur, near Petrol pump on Meerut Road by respondent no.1 on account of his rash and negligent driving while driving offending vehicle bearing registration no.

OPR 5.Whether the insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation?OPR 6. Relief. 6.To prove the case petitioner Kashmiri herself appeared as PW1 and produced PW2 Naresh eye witness, besides producing the documents Ex P1 to P13 7. On the other hand, respondents have not examined any witness. However Documents Ex R1 to Ex R5 have been tendered by the respondents in evidence. 8. I have heard the ld counsel for the parties and gone through the case file. My findings on the aforesaid issues are as under: ISSUE No.1: 9.Legal heirs of deceased Kanwarpal filed the present petition under section 166 of the MV Act on the ground that due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle bearing registratio n no. HR 42D-0194 by its driver, the accident took place in which Kanwarpal lost his life. In order to get compensation under section 166 of MV Act, petitioners are required to prove the fact that respondent no.1 was driving the offending vehicle bearing registration no. HR42D- 0194 in a rash and negligent manner. The main (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Kashmiri Devi etc vs Mahinder Singh MACP No.213 of 2015 -5- question is whether the offending vehicle was involved in the accident. The present case was registered on the statement of PW2 Naresh, who is eye witness of the alleged accident He deposed that on that day he was going to Haridwar with Kanwar Pal on motorcycle. Due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle no. HR 42D-0194 by respondent no.1, accident took place in which Kanwarpal lost his life and he sustained injuries being pillion rider on motorcycle being driven by Kanwar Pal. There is no ground to disbelieve the evidence of PW2 Naresh, who is injured/ eye-witness of the accident. He also proved the FIR Ex P1, which was recorded on his statement. In view of the evidence PW2 Naresh, who is eye witness of the accident, it is clear that respondent no.1 was driving the vehicle no. HR 42D- 0194 in a rash and negligent manner. 10 It is not disputed that in the present case FIR was got registered by PW2 Naresh, who had seen the accident and was present at the time of accident. As such it is clear that respondent no.1 was driving the offending vehicle at the time of accident. Respondent no.1 has not dared to appear in the witness box to deny his involvement in the accident in question. There is no ground to disbelieve the evidence of PW2. From the evidence, it is crystal clear that respondent no.1 was driving the vehicle in question at the time of accident in a rash and negligent manner and deceased Kanwarpal lost his life in the accident. 11 The oral as well as documentary evidence of the petitioners has gone completely un-rebutted . Registration number of the offending vehicle, involved in the accident has been mentioned in the FIR. The version put (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Kashmiri Devi etc vs Mahinder Singh MACP No.213 of 2015 -6- forth in the first information report regarding the factum and manner of the accident is entirely in consonance with the statement of eye witness PW2 Naresh. 12. Had the accident not taken place due to the rash and negligent driving of the vehicle in question by the respondent no.1, then as a man of ordinary prudence, he might have approached the higher police authorities for cancellation of the case, but neither there are pleadings nor any evidence on record to show that any step was taken by him in this direction. This conduct on the part of the respondent no.1 of remaining silent goes against him. Even Respondent no.1 did not dare to appear in the witness-box to prove that the accident in question had not taken place due to his rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Under such circumstances, it would be prima-facie safe and prudent to conclude that the accident in question took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by the respondent no.1. 13.In view of the fore-going discussion, I am of the view that the accident in question resulting into death of deceased Kanwarpal took place due to the rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle No. HR 42D- 10194 by the respondent no.1. Hence, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUE No. 2: 14This claim petition is in respect of death of Kanwarpal. In this claim petition, petitioner no.1 Kashmiri when appeared in the witness box as PW1 has testified that the dependants of Kanwarpal, who died due to the accident have filed this petition. In the petition petitioner alleged that deceased used to earn Rs 15,000/- per month as he was mason. She (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Kashmiri Devi etc vs Mahinder Singh MACP No.213 of 2015 -7- deposed that deceased was aged about 30 years. In the petition age of the deceased is mentioned as 35 years. In the PMR of deceased Kanwar Pal the age of deceased is mentioned as 35 years. There is no other proof of age of the deceased. Medical evidence cannot be discarded. Therefore, for the purpose of assessing compensation, it would be proper to consider the age of the deceased as 35 years at the time of his death as mentioned in the post mortem report Ex P5. 15. Now, coming to the dependency, Petitioner no.1 is wife of deceased and petitioners no.2 to 5 are minor children and petitioner no.6 is father of deceased. As per PW1 Kashmiri the petitioners were dependents on the income of deceased. The evidence adduced by the petitioners has gone unrebutted on this point. Petitioner no.1 being wife and petitioners no.2 to 5 being minor children of deceased and petitioner no.6 being father of deceased are entitled to get compensation for the death of the deceased in the ill-fated accident. 16. Hon'ble Supreme court in case of R.D.Hattangadi Vs Pest Control (India) Pvt.Ltd.1995 ACJ 366(SC) has observed that broadly speaking while fixing an amount of compensation payable to a victim of an accident, the damages have to be assessed separately as pecuniary damages and special damages. Pecuniary damages are those which the victim has actually incurred and which are capable of being calculated by arithmetic calculation. In order to appreciate two concepts, pecuniary damages may include expenses incurred by the claimant(i) medical attendance(ii) loss of earning of profit upto date of trial and (iii) other material loss. So far as non pecuniary damages are concerned, they may be suffered in future(ii) damages (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Kashmiri Devi etc vs Mahinder Singh MACP No.213 of 2015 -8- to compensate for the loss of amenities of life which may include a variety of matters i.e on account of injury the cliamant may not be able to walk, run or sit(iii) damages for the loss of expectation of life i.e. on account of injury the normal longevity of the person concerned is shortened and (iv) inconvenience, hardship, discomfort, disappointment, frustration and mental stress in life. 17. The petitioners have claimed that deceased used to earn Rs.15,000/- per month. But the petitioners have not placed on record any document to prove the income of deceased. As per evidence of PW1 Kashmiri the deceased was mason. As such income of deceased was more than a casual labour and he must be earning from his business, more than a casual labours. Now, a days income of a casual labour is not less than Rs 8,000/- Kanwarpal was only 35 years old and could have earned sufficient monthly income to maintain his family. In view of the law laid down by the Hon'bel Supreme Court in case Rajesh and others vs Rajbir Singh and others 20139 SCC 54 50% income is to be added as future prospectus. The deceased being of 35 years of age at the time of his death, 50% income earned by him is to be added as prospects of future income. C onsidering the age of deceased and the total income of the deceased after adding 50% of the income comes to Rs. 12000/- per month ( 8000+4000 per month) i.e. 1,44,000/- per year. It has also been laid down by the Apex Court in Smt. Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transportation Corporation and another 2009 (3) PLR 22, where the deceased was married, the deduction towards personal and living expenses of the deceased should be one third where the number of dependant family members is 2 to 3, one fourth where the number (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Kashmiri Devi etc vs Mahinder Singh MACP No.213 of 2015 -9- of the dependant family members is 4 to 6 and one fifth where the number of dependant family members exceeds six. In this case dependents are six. Therefore, after deducting one fourth of the income of the deceased as her personal expenses, contribution towards his family comes to Rs.1,08000/-per year. As per law laid down in Smt. Sarla Verma and others’ case 2009-3, PLR 22 the multiplier to be applied is of 16. So, the compensation after applying multiplier of 16 comes to 108000x 16= Rs.17,28,000/- 18The petitioners must have spent some expenses on the last rites of the deceased besides suffering loss of estate. As per law laid down in Rajesh and others vs Rajbir Singh and others 2013 (3) RCR (Civil) 170 (SC), petitioner's wife is awarded an amount of Rs.1,00,000/- towards loss of consortium. T he petitioners are further allowed Rs.25,000/- towards funeral expenses. Thus, the total amount payable to the petitioners comes to Rs.18,53000/-. The petitioners no. 1 to 6 being dependents on the income of the deceased are entitled to get compensation for the death of the deceased in the ill-fated accident. Issue no.2 is decided in favour of the petitioners. I SSUES NO.3 to 5 : 19. The respondent no.3 has raised the plea that the respondent no. 1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the accident. Perusal of copy of driving licence Ex R5 of respondent no.1 reveals that it was valid up 3.11.2015 for driving the vehicle MC, LMV , HMV and HTV only on the date of the accident i.e 9.2.2015. Therefore, it is clear that respondent no.1 was having valid driving license Ex R5 at the time of accident. 20.Now, question of liability of respondents to pay compensation. (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Kashmiri Devi etc vs Mahinder Singh MACP No.213 of 2015 -10- In the written statement respondent no.3 has not claimed that the vehicle in quesiton was not insured. Ex R2 is registration certificate of offending vehicle and Ex.R1 is insurance policy and Ex R4 is fitness certificae and it is clear that vehicle in question was insured with respondent no.3 on the date of accident . The respondent nos. 1 to 3 are held liable to pay the amount of compensation jointly as well as severally. As the vehicle was insured with respondent no.3 Insurance Company, respondent no.3 would be liable to make the payment of amount of compensation. RELIEF: 21 In view of my findings on the aforesaid issues, the claim petition is allowed in part with costs and a compensation of Rs. Rs.18,53,000/- is awarded to the petitioners alongwith interest at the rate of 7.5% per cent per annum to be calculated thereon from the date of the petition till realization, if the amount is deposited within two months of passing the award, failing which respondents shall be liable to to pay interest at the rate of 9% pa on the amount of compensation till payment. The respondents are directed to deposit the amount of compensation by way of cheque or bank draft in the name of petitioners in the bank account if copy of passbook is supplied by the petitioners to the counsel for respondent no.3. If account number is not supplied by petitioners then the compensation would be deposited in this Tribunal by way of cheque or bank draft in the name of the petitioners. 22 Out of total amount of Rs 18,53,000/- Rs 7,53,000/- is awarded to petitioner no.1 being widow of deceased Kanwar Pal and Rs 2,50,000/- each are granted to minor children of deceased i.e petitoenrs no. 2 (Dr.D.N.Bhardwaj) MACT,Sonipat HR0100 Kashmiri Devi etc vs Mahinder Singh MACP No.213 of 2015 -11- to 5 in the facts and circumstances, petitioner no.6 isd also entitled to Rs and Rs 1,00,000/- out of total amount of compensation. 23On realization of compensation amount along with interest, 50% of the amount alongwith interest accrued thereupon be paid to petitioner no.1 in cash and remaining 50% be deposited in the shape of FDRs in her name in any nationalized bank, fetching maximum interest for a period of three years. Share of amount of minor petitioners (no. 2 to 5) be deposited in their names in the shape of FDRs in any nationalized bank, fetching maximum interest till they attained majority. Payment of petitoner no.6 father of the deceased be made in cash. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly and file be consigned to record-room.

The claim petition titled as Pawan Vs.

While providing the particulars as required under the Motor Vehicles Act and the Rules framed thereunder, claimants Amarjeet, Anmol and Pawan inter alia alleged that on 8.5.2015, petitioners had gone to village Mohana from Gohana for supply of cold drinks on Maximo Mohindra No.HR-69B/0747 and after supply of cold drinks, they were going to Gohana. At about 4.30 PM when they reached at crossing of Lath-Jauli chowk, then all of a sudden, a Cruiser Jeep bearing registration No.HR- (Rajesh Sharma) MACT, Sonepat.20.7.2017. Amarjeet-Anmol-Pawan Vs. Jaideep & others. 4 61B/8018 driven by respondent No.1 came in a rash and negligent manner and hit Maxima Mohindra driven by claimant Pawan. In this accident, all three claimants suffered grievous injuries and fractures. A passerby called an ambulance and they were shifted to PGIMS, Khanpur Kalan for treatment. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of Cruiser Jeep bearing registration No.HR-61B/8018 driven by respondent No.1. On the statement of claimant Amarjeet, FIR No.154 dated 8.5.2015 was lodged by the police. Claimant Amarjeet suffered multiple simple and grievous injuries on his person and spent an amount of Rs.60,000/- on his treatment and medicines. He was helper on Maximo Mohndra No.HR-69B/0747 and was earning Rs.5000/- per month. Claimant Anmol suffered multiple simple and grievous injuries on his person and spent an amount of Rs.60,000/- on his treatment and medicines. He was also helper on Maximo Mohindra No.HR-69B/0747 and was earning Rs.5000/- per month. Claimant Pawan suffered grievous injuries and fractures on his person and spent an amount of Rs.4 lacs on his treatment, operation and medicines. He was driver on Maximo Mohindra No.HR-69B/0747 and was earning Rs.7000/- per month. 4.The respondent No.1 being driver-cum-owner of offending vehicle, and respondent No.2 being insurer of offending vehicle are jointly and severally liable to make payment of compensation. 5.Despite service of notice, none appeared on behalf of respondent No.1 and hence, respondent No.1 was proceeded against exparte vide order (Rajesh Sharma) MACT, Sonepat.20.7.2017. Amarjeet-Anmol-Pawan Vs. Jaideep & others. 5 dated 21.1.2016. 6.On notice, respondent No.2 filed written statement and took preliminary objections regarding petition being bad for mis-joinder and non- joinder of necessary parties, cause of action and maintainability. It is stated that no such alleged accident ever took place and alleged offending vehicle has been falsely implicated in the present case by the claimants in collusion with respondents No. 1 in order to grab the compensation from answering respondent. On merits, again the factum of accident has been denied and it is averred that no such accident took place with alleged offending vehicle due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. FIR No.154 dated 8.5.2015 is a procured document. The claimants are not entitled to claim any compensation. The amount of compensation claimed is excessive and exorbitant and petitions are liable to be dismissed. Respondent No.2 also took additional pleas that respondent No.1 was not having a valid and effective driving licence at the relevant time and was driving the vehicle in violation of terms and conditions of insurance policy. It is stated that alleged accident took place due to sole negligence of driver of Maximo Mahindra. 7.On the basis of pleadings of parties, the following issues were settled for adjudication on 12.08.2016 in claim petition titled as Sunil Vs. Vinod & others :- 1.Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of Cruiser Jeep bearing No.HR-61B/8018 by its driver- (Rajesh Sharma) MACT, Sonepat.20.7.2017.

OPP. 2.If issue No.1 is proved in the affirmative, to what amount of compensation, the petitioners are entitled to and from whom? OPP 3.Whether the claim petition is not maintainable and petitioners have no cause of action and locus standi to file the present claim petition?OPR. 4.Whether respondent No.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident? If so, its effect. 5.Whether respondent No.1 was driving the vehicle bearing Regn. No.HR-61B-8018 In violation of terms and conditions of insurance policy?OPR. 6.Relief. 8.In order to prove their case, claimant Pawan examined himself as PW1, claimant Anmol examined himself as PW2 and claimant Amarjeet @ Chhotu examined himself as PW3. Claimants further examined Ankit Jangra as PW3 and Satish as PW4. Claimants have relied upon the following documents in evidence :- Ex.P1 copy of final report, Ex.P2 copy of charge-sheet, Ex.P3 copy of superdari order, Ex.P4 application for release of vehicle No.HR- 61B/8018, Ex.P5 mechanical report, Ex.P6 copy of site plan, Ex.P7 memo of personal search of respondent No.1, Ex.P8 memo of arrest, Ex.P9 copy of (Rajesh Sharma) MACT, Sonepat.20.7.2017. Amarjeet-Anmol-Pawan Vs. Jaideep & others. 7 registration certificate of vehicle No.HR-61B/8018, Ex.P10 copy of insurance policy, Ex.P8(again) copy of FIR, Ex.P11 copy of driving licence of claimant Pawan, Ex.P12 cash memo of claimant Pawan, Ex.P13 copy of invoice of claimant Pawan, Ex.P14 salary certificate of claimant Pawan, Ex.P15 and Ex.P16 cash memos of claimant Pawan, Ex.P17 statement of claimant Pawan, Ex.P18 MLR of claimant Pawan, Ex.PA MLR of claimant Amarjeet and Ex.PB MLR of claimant Anmol. 9. In rebuttal evidence, claimants tendered Ex.P19 disability certificate of claimant Pawan. 10.On the other hand, to rebut the evidence of petitioners, no evidence either oral or documentary has been adduced by respondent No.2. 11.I have heard the arguments on behalf of both sides and have gone through the files. My issue-wise findings with reasons are as under - ISSUE No.1 (in all three petitions) 12. Onus to prove this issue was upon the petitioners. Under this issue, petitioners were required to prove that on 8.5.2015 at about 4.30 P.M., an accident took place due to negligence of respondent No.1 i.e. driver of offending vehicle bearing Registration No.HR-61B/8018, due to which, they (Amarjeet, Anmol and Pawan) sustained injuries. 13.In order to prove this issue, petitioners Pawan, Anmol and Amarjeet in all three petitions have examined themselves as PW1, PW2 and PW3 respectively who tendered their duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW1/A, Ex.PW2/A and Ex.PW3/A respectively in their evidence and reiterated the averments of petitions. They deposed that on 8.5.2015, petitioners had gone (Rajesh Sharma) MACT, Sonepat.20.7.2017. Amarjeet-Anmol-Pawan Vs. Jaideep & others. 8 to village Mohana from Gohana for supply of cold drinks in Maximo Mohindra No.HR-69B/0747 and after supply of cold drinks, they were going to Gohana. At about 4.30 PM when they reached at crossing of Lath-Jauli chowk, then all of a sudden, a Cruiser Jeep bearing registration No.HR- 61B/8018 driven by respondent No.1 in a rash and negligent manner and hit Maxima Mohndra driven by claimant Pawan. In this accident, all three claimants suffered grievous injuries and fractures. A passerby called an ambulance and they were shifted to PGIMS, Khanpur Kalan for treatment. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of Cruiser Jeep bearing registration No.HR-61B/8018 driven by respondent No.1. On the statement of claimant Amarjeet, FIR No.154 dated 8.5.2015 was lodged by the police. 14.Further, it is apparent from Ex.P1 Final report and FIR Ex.P8 under Sections 279/337/338 IPC that prosecution of respondent No.1 Jaideep was going on and vide charge-sheet Ex.P2, charge has been framed against him. These facts are themselves sufficient corroboration to testimony of witnesses examined by petitioners. 15.As against this cogent oral as well as documentary evidence regarding the manner of accident, no evidence whatsoever has been produced by the respondents. Even the respondent no.1 has not contested the claim petitions by appearing before the Tribunal and he was proceeded against exparte. It is settled law that where driver of offending vehicle does not come forward to deny his negligence, there is a presumption that the claim of the claimant is correct. In this regard, reliance may be placed upon the law laid (Rajesh Sharma) MACT, Sonepat.20.7.2017. Amarjeet-Anmol-Pawan Vs. Jaideep & others. 9 down in Raju & others Vs. Sukhvinder Singh and others, 2006(4) RCR(Civil) page 82 . In view of my above discussions and reasonings and in the light of law discussed above, this Tribunal reaches at the conclusion that accident in question took place due to negligent driving of vehicle No.HR-61B/8018 by respondent No.1 being its driver, due to which, claimants Amarjeet, Anmol and Pawan sustained injuries. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners and against the respondents. I SSUE No.2 (in all claim petitions) - 16.In claim petition titled as Amarjeet Vs. Jaideep and others, claimant has claimed a compensation of Rs.10 lacs on account of injuries caused by him in the accident in question. It is the case of claimant Amarjeet that after the accident, a passerby called an ambulance and shifted them to PGIMS, Khanpur Kalan for treatment. Claimant Amarjeet has tendered his MLR Ex.PA in evidence in which two injuries have been shown. However, claimant Amarjeet did not tender any medical bill which shows that he spent no amount on medicines etc., because, PGIMS, Khanpur Kalan is government hospital and treatment in all government hospitals is given free of costs. Thus, no amount is given to claimant Amarjeet on account of medicines etc. Since claimant Amarjeet sustained two injuries, he must have suffered some pain and sufferings, so, claimant Amarjeet is granted Rs.10,000/- on account of pain and suffering caused to him in this accident. 17. In claim petition titled as Anmol Vs. Jaideep and others, claimant has claimed a compensation of Rs.10 lacs on account of injuries (Rajesh Sharma) MACT, Sonepat.20.7.2017. Amarjeet-Anmol-Pawan Vs. Jaideep & others. 10 caused to him in the accident in question. It is the case of claimant Anmol that after the accident, a passerby called an ambulance and shifted them to PGIMS, Khanpur Kalan for treatment. Claimant Anmol has tendered his MLR Ex.PB in evidence in which two injuries have been shown. However, claimant Anmol did not tender any medical bill which shows that he spent no amount on medicines etc., because, PGIMS, Khanpur Kalan is government hospital and treatment in all government hospitals is given free of costs. Thus, no amount is given to claimant Anmol on account of medicines etc. Since claimant Anmol sustained two injuries, he must have suffered some pain and sufferings, so, claimant Anmol is granted Rs.10,000/- on account of pain and suffering caused by him in this accident. 18. In claim petition titled as Pawan Vs. Jaideep and others, claimant has claimed a compensation of Rs.20 lacs on account of injuries caused to him in the accident in question. It is the case of claimant Pawan that after the accident, a passerby called an ambulance and shifted them to PGIMS, Khanpur Kalan for treatment. Claimant Pawan has tendered his MLR Ex.P18 in evidence. He was suffering from post fracture right femur and BB leg with ORIF and fracture left patella. He tendered Ex.P12, Ex.P13, Ex.P15 and Ex.P16 which are amounting to Rs.15,698/-, so, the amount of Rs.15,698/- is granted to claimant Pawan being amount spent on treatment and medicines. Claimant Pawan has also tendered disability certificate Ex.P19 which shows that he has become 43% temporary disabled. Claimant has not examined the concerned doctor who could have explained better regarding the (Rajesh Sharma) MACT, Sonepat.20.7.2017. Amarjeet-Anmol-Pawan Vs. Jaideep & others. 11 injuries of claimant. It may be mentioned that due to fracture of right femur and fracture of left patella, the claimant will have difficulty in walking/climbing stairs and will be unable to walk fast or run. Hence, the claimant will suffer loss of enjoyment of life and loss of amenities. Thus, in view of 43% disability, an amount of Rs.43,000/- is granted to claimant Pawan on account of temporary disability and Rs.20,000/- on account of loss of enjoyment of life and loss of amenities. Claimant Pawan was suffering from fractures, so, he must have suffered pain and sufferings and hence, claimant Pawan is granted Rs.20,000/- on account of pain and suffering caused to him in this accident. During the treatment, claimant visited the hospital and spent on transportation. Thus, claimant is granted Rs.10,000/- on account of transportation. Claimant is also granted Rs.5000/- on account of special diet. Thus, a total compensation of Rs.1,13,698/- (Rs.one lac thirteen thousand six hundred nintyeight only) is granted to claimant Pawan. 19.The next question to be determined is as to who is liable to pay the compensation? Claimants have tendered in evidence certified copy of driving licence of respondent No.1 which was issued on 15.4.2014 and is valid upto 14.4.2034 and said driving licence is for driving of M.C. with gear, LMV-NT-Car, LMV Tractor only. Respondent No.2 has not produced any evidence to show that said driving licence is not a valid and effective driving licence. Claimants have also tendered Ex.P10 insurance police which shows that it is valid from 15.1.2015 till 14.1.2016 midnight. Date of accident is 8.5.2015. Thus, the liability to make the payment shall be joint and several of both the respondents, but, ultimately liability of payment lies with respondent (Rajesh Sharma) MACT, Sonepat.20.7.2017. Amarjeet-Anmol-Pawan Vs. Jaideep & others. 12 No.2 as offending vehicle was insured with it and respondent No.2 is bound to indemnify respondent No.1, the registered owner of offending vehicle. Accordingly, issues No.2 is decided in favour of petitioners. ISSUE NO.3:- 20.Onus to prove this issue was upon the respondents. Respondents have not produced evidence to prove this issue.

Further submitted that during the said period right leg of claimant-injured Deepak was operated and iron rod was inserted and still outdoor patient of then said hospital. Further claimant-injured Deepak asserted that due to the accident, he could not attend his college as he has became disable and also not able to perform his daily work as well as his studies. Further asserted that claimant has spent an amount of Rs.2,00,000/- on his treatment, transportation, special diet and attendant etc. That claimant-injured Deepak was earning Rs.10,000/- per month by doing part time photography at the time of accident and has suffered huge mental and financial loss due to the injuries suffered in the accident. C laimant-injured Deepak has claimed compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- from the respondents. 6. It is further the case of petitioners that at the time of accident, respondent No.1 was driving the offending vehicle, respondent No. 2 was owner and the offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.3, hence, all the respondents are liable to make payment of compensation amount to the petitioners jointly and severally. 7. Having received notices, respondents No.1 and 2 filed their joint written-statement, thereby pleaded that no such accident was ever been took place and a false FIR has been lodged against the respondent No.1. That the vehicle of the respondent No.2 has been falsely involved in the claim petitions in collusion of the police and the amount claimed by the petitioners has been highly excessive and without any basis. While 6 denying the remaining averments, dismissal of petitions with costs has been prayed for. 8. Respondent No.3-insurance company has filed separate written statement thereby pleaded that no such alleged accident took place with the offending vehicle and a false story has been concocted regarding the alleged accident and the FIR has been falsely lodged by complainant after seven days of the alleged accident. Further pleaded that there was no rash and negligent driving on the part of the driver of the offending vehicle rather the alleged accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of complainant Deepak himself who was driving the motorcycle rashly & negligently and in a zig zag manner without caring for the vehicles coming from the opposite side. That no intimation regarding the alleged accident was given to the insurance company by the respondents No.1 and 2. Further submitted that the respondent No.1 was not having any valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident. On merits, it has been averred that a false FIR has been lodged by complainant Deepak after a delay of seven days regarding the alleged accident with malafide intention to grab false compensation from the answering respondent with a view to save his own skin. That the amount of compensation as claimed by the petitioners is highly exaggerated and without any basis. Rest of the assertions are denied and prayed for dismissing all the claim petitions with costs. 9. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed on 29.04.2016 :- 7 1.Whether injuries to claimant Manoj son of Krishan and Deepak son of Rohtash are the result of accident which took place on 24.02.2015 due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle i.e. Bus bearing No.HR-69A-6580 by respondent No.1? OPP. 2.If issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation, the claimants / petitioners are entitled to and from whom?OPP. 3.Whether respondent No.1 was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident and the offending vehicle had violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect? OPR- 3. 4.Relief. 10. In order to prove their case, injured Deepak and injured Manoj themselves appeared into the witness box as PW-5 & PW-6 and examined Dr.S.P. Sharma, SMO as PW-1, Harvinder Singh, Record Keeper as PW-2, Deepak, Record Keeper as PW-3, Anant Dhiman as PW-4. 11. On the other hand, respondents have not led any oral evidence but relied upon some documentary evidence. 12.I have appraised the evidence on record, the material circumstances of the case and the arguments addressed by learned counsel for the parties. My findings on the aforesaid issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1 13. The burden to prove this issue was upon the petitioners and in order to discharge onus on their part, petitioner Deepak examined himself as PW-5, who is also injured in the accident in question as well as eye witness to the accident. PW-5 tendered into evidence his 8 duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW-5/A, thereby deposing about the manner of accident. Further petitioner Manoj examined himself as PW-6 who is also injured & eye witnesses to the accident in question. He also tendered into evidence his duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW-6/A thereby deposing about the manner of accident and also corroborated assertion of PW-5 as well as the facts mentioned in the claim petitions. Further petitioners have placed on record copy of FIR/Ex.PW-5/B and copy of report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex.P-46. From the perusal of the FIR/Ex.PW-5/B as well as report under Section 173 Cr.P.C./Ex.P-46 clearly shows that a case was registered against the offending vehicle on the statement of PW-5 and registration number of the offending vehicle has been specifically mentioned in the FIR as well as report under section 173 Cr.P.C. Further perusal of the follow up and discharge card/Ex.P-11 of injured-claimant Deepak issued by BPS Government Medical College for Women, Khanpur Kalan, Sonipat, copy of MLR of injured-claimant Manoj/Ex.P- 38 prepared at G.H. Sonipat, follow up and discharge card/Ex.P-39 of injured-claimant Manoj issued by BPS Government Medical College for Women, Khanpur Kalan, Sonipat and copy of MLR of injured-claimant Deepak/Ex.P-45 prepared at G.H. Sonipat shows that petitioners Manoj and Deepak were got admitted in the said hospitals on the fateful day of accident. It is further alleged that the accident in question has been caused due to rash and negligent driving of its driver. Though respondent No.1 has taken specific plea in the reply that no accident took place due to his negligence, however he has failed to fortify his assertion and failed to rebut the evidence of the claimants. Had the accident not taken place as 9 alleged by the petitioners, respondent No.1 would certainly have made complaints to the higher authorities regarding false implication of the offending vehicle with regard to the accident, but no such event happened. Therefore, the evidence coming on record proves rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 in causing the accident in question. This Tribunal does not see any reason to disbelieve the evidence produced by the petitioners. In such circumstances, it is held that petitioners have proved that the accident in question had been caused due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No.1, on the touch stone of preponderance of probabilities. This issue is accordingly decided in favour of petitioner and against the respondents. ISSUES NO.2: Case No.MACP/517/2015 titled as “ Manoj Versus Bablu Shah and Others” 14. Petitioner Manoj has stated that Rs.2,00,000/- has been incurred upon his treatment, transportation, special diet and attendant etc. and he is still outdoor patient. Further petitioner while appeared into the witness box as PW-6 has deposed that after the accident he remained admitted in PGIMS, Khanpur w.e.f. 24.02.2015 to 09.03.2015 and operated on his right leg and iron rod was inserted in his right leg. Further PW-6 deposed that he also remained OPD with Dhiman Nursing Home, Village Atta, District Panipat from 01.05.2015 to 31.05.2015 and 01.06.2015 to 15.07.2015 and is still outdoor patient. Injured-claimant Manoj has placed on record disability certificate Ex.P-1, invoice slips Ex.P-7 and Ex.P-8, bills Ex.P-40, Ex.P-43 and Ex.P-44. Further the 10 invoice slips Ex.P-7 and Ex.P-8 have been duly proved by PW-3/Deepak, Record Keeper, Narwal Medicos and Surgical, Rohtak who deposed that the invoice slips/medical bills Ex.P-7 and Ex.P-8 issued to Manoj by their medical store and identified the signatures of Rajesh Proprietor. Further injured-claimant Manoj asserted that he also remained admitted in Dhiman Nursing Home, VPO Atta, District Panipat and in this injured-claimant Manoj has placed on record documents Ex.P- 9 and Ex.P-10 and these documents have been duly proved by PW- 4/Anant Dhiman, Dhiman Nursing Home, VPO Atta, District Panipat. However, from the perusal of documents Ex.P-9 and Ex.P-10 shows that these documents are merely prescription slips and said documents were not duly proved by injured-claimant Manoj in accordance with law. Further PW-4 in his cross-examination admitted that he had issued prescription slips to Manoj Kumar and no separate bill or receipt was issued by him to Manoj Kumar. Further PW-4 also admitted that he did not maintain any bill book or receipt book. No other bill regarding expenses on treatment has been placed on record. 15. Referring to the testimony of the witnesses above, learned counsel for the claimant has prayed for compensating the petitioner fairly. 16. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents have prayed for only assessing just compensation to the petitioner. It is pointed out that most of the bills are exaggerated and procured one and no reliance should be placed upon them. It is prayed that the documents should be properly scrutinized and then taken into consideration. 11 17. After having heard both the sides and perusing the record carefully, it may be observed that proceedings before Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal are summary in nature and strict provisions of Indian Evidence Act are not applicable to it and the probative value of the documents may not be suspected without any reasonable cause. 18. From the perusal of bills placed on record by injured- claimant Manoj shows that he has incurred the total amount of Rs.34,535/- upon his treatment. Keeping in view the nature of injuries and period of treatment, an amount of Rs.34,535/- is allowed to injured- claimant Manoj for treatment expenses. 19.Petitioner has also pleaded that he has suffered disability on account of injuries in accident dated 24.02.2015. To prove the disability injured-claimant Manoj had examined Dr.S.P. Sharma, SMO, Government Hospital, Sonipat as PW-1. Dr. S.P. Sharma had asserted to have examined Manoj Kumar (claimant) along with Dr.Sita Ram and Dr.C.P. Arora. Disability certificate Ex. P-1 certifying 40% temporary disability on account of post fracture right hip, femur and both bones leg with his stiffness of right hip, knee and ankle. Learned Counsel for respondents has argued that since petitioner has failed to show any loss of earning capacity therefore he is not entitled to any compensation on account of disability which is temporary in nature. Petitioner, therefore, has failed to show loss of earning capacity or loss of opportunity due to injuries suffered by him. Further there is no documentary proof regarding his income has been placed on record. In these circumstances no loss of 12 earning has been suffered by petitioner. Since the disability is temporary in nature, therefore, injured-petitioner is entitled to compensation of Rs.40,000/- at the rate of Rs.1000/- x 40% temporary disability. 20. As per the evidence led by claimant, injured-claimant Manoj remained admitted in PGIMS, Khanpur w.e.f. 24.02.2015 to 09.03.2015. Further except the above said period of admission and discharge as well as bills, there is no evidence on record to prove that injured-claimant Manoj was advised any bed rest thereafter, which might have restrained him from doing any kind of work. In this way, the claimant is held to be away from doing his work for 14 days and, thus, loss of income suffered by the claimant comes to Rs.5,180/- (Rs.370 x 14 days). Thus, the claimant is held liable to be compensated this amount on account of loss of income. 21. Furthermore, injured-claimant Manoj is also entitled to be compensated for the pain and agony suffered by him at the time of accident. As such, Rs.20,000/- will adequately compensate him for the pain and agony. 22. Besides this, the claimant had certainly taken special diet for early recovery during his treatment and as such, he is held entitled for compensation to the tune of Rs.5,000/- under the head of better diet. 23. Besides this, on account of transportation, the claimant will be compensated to the tune of Rs.1600/- as he has placed on record receipt / Ex.P-41 regarding transportation. 13 24. No documentary proof is available on the file showing the further treatment of the claimant. Thus, the claimant cannot be held liable under the head of future treatment. 25. In view of above, injured-claimant Manoj is held entitled to following compensation:- 1.Medical expenses Rs.34,535/- 2. Disability Rs.40,000/- 3.Better diet Rs. 5,000/- 4.Pain & Suffering Rs.20,000/- 5.Transportation charges Rs. 1,600/- 6.Loss of Income Rs. 5,180/- TOTAL: Rs.1,06,315/- As such, injured-claimant Manoj is held entitled to a total compensation of Rs.1,06,315/- . Case No.MACP/527/2015 titled as “Deepak Versus Bablu Shah and Others” 26. In support of his claim, injured-claimant Deepak himself appeared into the witness box as PW-5 and has tendered duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW-5/A deposing therein that he had sustained serious, multiple and grievous injuries on the right leg and iron rod was inserted in his right leg. After the accident, he was shifted to G.H. Sonipat where he was medico-legally examined and MLR was prepared and from where he was referred to PGIMS, Khanpur where he remained admitted from 24.02.2015 to 09.03.2015. Further asserted that he also get OPD from Handa Hospital, Sonipat on various dates and after that he remained admitted in Virk Hospital, Karnal where he remained admitted w.e.f. 14 08.07.2015 to 09.07.2015 and operated upon his right leg. Injured- claimant Deepak further asserted that he is still under treatment. He further deposed that prior to the accident he used to earn Rs.10,000/- per month by doing job of part time photographer. Further asserted that he has also suffered huge mental and financial loss due to the said accident. 27.Further in support of his claim, injured-claimant Deepak examined Harvinder Singh, Record Keeper as PW-2. This witness deposed that he has brought the admission file and discharge summary and hospital bill pertaining to patient Deepak who admitted in their hospital on 08.07.2016 and discharged on 09.07.2016. This witness also proved the original discharge summary and hospital bill dated 09.07.2016 as Ex.P-3 and Ex.P-4. PW-2 also proved the bill Ex.P-5 regarding anesthesia dated 08.07.2016 issued by Dr.Vinod Sharma. Further petitioner Deepak has placed on record his disability certificate Ex.P-2, medical bills Ex.P-6, Ex.P-12, Ex.P-17 to Ex.P-36. However, from the perusal of the bills Ex.P-4, Ex.P-17 to Ex.P-22 reveals that these bills have not been proved in accordance with law. 28. From the perusal of bills placed on record by injured-claimant Deepak shows that he has incurred the total amount of Rs.55,573/- upon his treatment. Keeping in view the nature of injuries and period of treatment, an amount of Rs.55,575/- (rounded off) is allowed to injured- claimant Deepak for treatment expenses. 29.Petitioner has also pleaded that he has suffered disability on account of injuries in accident dated 24.02.2015. To prove the disability injured-claimant Deepak had examined Dr.S.P. Sharma, SMO, 15 Government Hospital, Sonipat as PW-1. Dr. S.P. Sharma had asserted to have examined Deepak (claimant) along with Dr.Sita Ram and Dr.C.P. Arora. Disability certificate Ex.P-2 certifying 50% temporary disability on account of post fracture S/C femur with plating and fracture both bones right leg with nailing with stiffness and pain of right knee and ankle with delayed union. Learned Counsel for respondents has argued that since petitioner has failed to show any loss of earning capacity therefore he is not entitled to any compensation on account of disability which is temporary in nature. Petitioner, therefore, has failed to show loss of earning capacity or loss of opportunity due to injuries suffered by him. Further there is no documentary proof regarding his income has been placed on record. In these circumstances no loss of earning has been suffered by petitioner. Since the disability is temporary in nature, therefore, injured-petitioner is entitled to compensation of Rs.50,000/- at the rate of Rs.1000/- x 50% being temporary disability. 30. As per the evidence led by claimant, injured-claimant Deepak remained admitted in PGIMS, Khanpur w.e.f. 24.02.2015 to 09.03.2015. Further except the above said period of admission and discharge as well as bills, there is no evidence on record to prove that injured-claimant Deepak was advised any bed rest thereafter, which might have restrained him from doing any kind of work. In this way, the claimant is held to be away from doing his work for 14 days and, thus, loss of income suffered by the claimant comes to Rs.5,180/- (Rs.370 x 14 days). Thus, the claimant is held liable to be compensated this amount on account of loss of income. 16 31. Furthermore, injured-claimant Deepak is also entitled to be compensated for the pain and agony suffered by him at the time of accident. As such, Rs.20,000/- will adequately compensate him for the pain and agony. 32. Besides this, the claimant had certainly taken special diet for early recovery during his treatment and as such, he is held entitled for compensation to the tune of Rs.5,000/- under the head of better diet. 33. Besides this, on account of transportation, the claimant will be compensated to the tune of Rs.1600/- as he has placed on record receipt / Ex.P-13 regarding transportation. 34. No documentary proof is available on the file showing the further treatment of the claimant. Thus, the claimant cannot be held liable under the head of future treatment. 35. In view of above, injured-claimant Manoj is held entitled to following compensation:- 1.Medical expenses Rs.55,575/- 2. Disability Rs.50,000/- 3.Better diet Rs. 5,000/- 4.Pain & Suffering Rs.20,000/- 5.Transportation charges Rs.1,600/- 6.Loss of Income Rs.5,180/- TOTAL: Rs.1,37,355/- As such, injured-claimant Manoj is held entitled to a total compensation of Rs.1,37,355/- . ISSUES NO.3: 17 36.In this issue, it is to be seen as to who is responsible for compensating the claimants. 37. It is argued on behalf of the respondent no.3 insurance company that as per verification report respondent No.1 was not having any valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident. It is, therefore, argued that since there is infringement in the terms of the policy as the offending vehicle was being driven by an unlicensed driver, therefore, insurance company cannot be burdened with indemnifying the owner of the offending vehicle. Reliance in this regard has been placed upon Sardari and others Vs. Sushil Kumar and others, 2008 (3) PLR 427, United India Insurance Company Limited Vs. Lajwanti Kaur and others, 2014 (2) PLR 836 and Munshi Ram and another Vs. Balkar Singh and others, 2016 (2) PLR 527. 38.On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents No.1 and 2 have placed on record copy of registration certificate Ex.R-1, copy of insurance policy Ex.R-2, copy of driving licence Ex.R-3 valid till (NT) 18.01.2031 and valid till (T) 17.01.2017, copy of fitness certificate Ex.R- 4, copy of public carriage permit Ex.R-5 and argued that the driving licence/Ex.R-3 of the respondent No.1 was valid and effective for driving the offending vehicle at the time of accident. 39. After having heard learned counsel for the respondent no.3 and perusing the record, learned counsel for the respondent No.3 has failed to examine any witness from the Licensing Authority, Salt Lake, Calcutta who proved that the driving licence placed on record by the respondent No.1 is fake. Even RW-1 Sandeep Kapoor, Senior Executive 18 examined by the respondent No.3-insurance Company, who in his cross- examination has admitted that as per Ex.R-3, driving licence of respondent No.1 has been shown effective for transport vehicle from 16.11.2004 up to 17.01.2017. Thus, it is proved that the driving licence of respondent no.1 was genuine. 40. Since insurance company has failed to discharge any such onus, therefore, it is proved that the driver was holding a valid driving licence and there is no infringement of the terms of policy. Therefore, there remains no amount of ambiguity that the respondents No.1 to 3 shall remain jointly and severally liable to compensate the claimants for the amount of compensation assessed above. However, insurance company- respondent No.3 shall make full payment of the award amount of compensation to the claimants, being insurer of the offending vehicle bearing registration No. HR-69A-6580. It is ordered accordingly. Both these issues are accordingly decided in favour of claimants and against respondents. (RELIEF) 41. Consequent upon my findings on aforesaid issues, both the claim petitions are accepted partly with costs. 42. Claimant/petitioner Manoj in c ase bearing No.MACP/517/2015 titled as “Manoj Versus Bablu Shah and others” is held entitled for compensation amount in the sum of Rs.1,06,315/- only. 19 43. Claimant-petitioner Deepak in case bearing No.MACP/527/2015 titled as “Deepak Versus Bablu Shah and others” is held entitled for compensation amount in the sum of Rs.1,37,355/- only. 44. In view of the observations made by the Hon’ble Apex Court in ‘New India Assurance Company Limited Versus Charlie and another, 2005(2) The Punjab Law Reporter, 611 ’, the claimants are also allowed interest on the amount of compensation so awarded at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till the date of payment, if the amount is deposited within two months of passing of the award, failing which respondents No.1 to 3 shall be liable to pay interest @ 9% per annum on the amount of compensation till payment. Copy of this judgment be also placed on connected claim petition bearing No.MACP/517/2015 titled as “Deepak Vs. Bablu Shah and others” . 45. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.1,100/-. Memos of costs be prepared and all the files be consigned to the record room. Announced in open court. (Dr. Sushil Kumar Garg) Dated : 03.07.2017. Motor Accidents Claim Tribunal Sonipat.

From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed:- 1.Whether the accident in question, resulting into the death of Manjeet son of Ram Mehar, had occurred on account of motor vehicular accident on 10.09.2015 at about 5.00 a.m. in the area Sector-7, Sonepat under P.S. Sadar, Sonepat by respondent no.1 on account of his rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle i.e. Yellow Bus bearing registration no. HR-69-A-2001? OPP. 2.If issue No. 1 is decided in favour of the claimants, whether the claimants are entitled to claim amount as claimed in the claim petition and from whom ? OPP. 3.Whether the claim petition is not maintainable in the present form ? OPR. 4.Whether the Insurance Company is not liable to pay any compensation ? OPR. 5.Relief. 8.In order to prove their case, petitioners have examined PW1 Smt. Sarita (petitioner no.1), who has narrated the facts of the claim petition IN MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT, PRESIDED OVER BY SUSHIL KUMAR, ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, SONEPAT. UID No. HR-0077 MACP/CIS No. 567 of 22.11.2015 Smt. Sarita etc. vs. Santlal etc. D.O.D. 01.08.2017 6 in her affidavit Ex.PW1/A. She has also placed on record a copy of ration card Ex.P1, copy of voter identity card Ex.P2 and copy of Aadhar Card Ex.P3. Petitioners have also examined PW2 Ram Mehar, father of deceased- Manjeet, who has proved copy of F.I.R. as Ex.P4 and postmortem report Ex.P5. 9.Petitioners have also examined PW3 Hitender Dahiya, Manager, Raj Filling Station, Bahalgarh. He has deposed that deceased- Manjeet son of Ram Mehar was employed at Raj Filling Station as a supervisor and his salary was Rs.11,500/- per month. He has proved the salary certificate Ex.P6. 10.On the other hand respondent nos. 1 and 2 have examined RW1 Ashish Arya, President, Little Angle, Sr. Secondary School, Sonepat. 11.Respondent no.3 has examined RW2 Anal Bihar Sahai, Record Clerk, ARTO Office, Mathura, U.P., and RW3 Nilesh Bairwa, Sr. Executive, Legal, Bajaj Alianz General Insurance Co. Ltd. 12.I have heard learned counsels appearing on behalf of both sides and perused the record carefully. My issue-wise findings along with reasons are as under:- ISSUE NO. 1:- 13. PW2 Ram Mehar, father of deceased Manjeet, has deposed that he witnessed the accident in question and this accident was caused by respondent no.1 by driving the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent IN MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT, PRESIDED OVER BY SUSHIL KUMAR, ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, SONEPAT. UID No. HR-0077 MACP/CIS No. 567 of 22.11.2015 Smt. Sarita etc. vs. Santlal etc. D.O.D. 01.08.2017 7 manner. He has also proved copy of F.I.R. Ex.P4 which shows that the police registered the case against the driver of the offending vehicle for causing the accident in question by driving the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. The petitioners have also placed on record copy of postmortem report Ex.P5 which shows that deceased Manjeet son of Ram Mehar died due to injuries sustained in the accident. Since respondent no.1 has not appeared in the witness box, this Tribunal has no reason to disbelieve the evidence of the petitioners. Therefore, issue No. 1 is decided in favour of petitioners. ISSUE NO. 2:- 14.The petitioners have claimed that deceased Manjeet was serving at Raj Filling Station and was getting salary of Rs.11,500/- per month. The petitioners have examined PW3 Hitender Dahiya, Manager, Raj Filling Station, Sonepat, who has proved the salary certificate Ex.P6. He has stated on oath that deceased Manjeet son of Ram Mehar was employed as a supervisor and was getting Rs.11,500/- per month. However, he did not produce any appointment letter, attendance register, ledger book or account statement of Raj Filling Station. He also failed to produce any receipt of salary paid to the deceased- Manjeet. Therefore, his oral statement is not sufficient to prove that the deceased- Manjeet was earning Rs.11,500/- per month. However, it may be presumed that the deceased- Manjeet must have been earning minimum wages, which were about Rs.6000/- per month IN MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT, PRESIDED OVER BY SUSHIL KUMAR, ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, SONEPAT. UID No. HR-0077 MACP/CIS No. 567 of 22.11.2015 Smt. Sarita etc. vs. Santlal etc. D.O.D. 01.08.2017 8 at the time of accident. Therefore, income of the deceased- Manjeet is presumed to be Rs.6000/- per month, which comes to Rs.72,000/- per annum. As per the postmortem report Ex.P5, the age of the deceased- Manjeet was 27-28 years. In view of the law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Rajesh vs. Rajbir 2013, ACJ, 1403 , 50% of the income is to be added for future prospects. Therefore, annual income of the deceased Manjeet is presumed to be Rs.1,08,000/- per annum. After deducting 1/3rd income of the deceased towards his personal expenses, annual loss of income comes Rs.72,000/- only. Since the age of deceased- Manjeet was 27-28 years, the multiplier of 17 is applicable. By applying the multiplier of 17, total loss of income comes to Rs. 12,24,000/- (Rs. Twelve Lacs Twenty Four Thousands only). 15.Besides, a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- for loss of consortium, a sum of Rs.1,00,000/- for loss of love and affection and a sum of Rs. 25,000/- for funeral expenses also allowed to the petitioners. 16.In view of my above discussion, it is concluded that petitioners are entitled to compensation of Rs.14,49,000/- only (Rs. Fourteen Lacs & Forty Nine Thousands only). 17.Now the question for determination is whether the insurance company is liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. Ld. counsel for respondent no. 3 has argued that RW2 Anal Bihari Sahai, record Clerk, ARTO Office, Mathura, U.P., has proved that driving license of respondent IN MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT, PRESIDED OVER BY SUSHIL KUMAR, ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, SONEPAT. UID No. HR-0077 MACP/CIS No. 567 of 22.11.2015 Smt. Sarita etc. vs. Santlal etc. D.O.D. 01.08.2017 9 no.1was fake. He has contended that since the driving license of respondent no.1 was fake, therefore, insurance company is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. 18.On the other hand, Ld. counsel for respondent nos.1 and 2 has argued that the respondent no.2 has deposed in his statement as RW1 that he had seen the driving license of respondent no.1 and had also taken interview of the respondent no. 1, at the time of giving employment to him and test was also conducted for assessing his ability to drive heavy motor vehicle. He has argued that the offending vehicle was insured with respondent no.3 and therefore, respondent no.3 is liable to pay the compensation to the petitioners. 19.It has been held that Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana in case of Mewa Singh vs. Baljinder Singh, 2016 (5), R.C.R. Civil, 1005 , that mere fact that the driving license was found fake is no ground to absolve of insurance company from liability to pay the compensation, if the owner of offending vehicle took the driving test of driver while employing him and also saw his driving license. Similar law has been laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Pepsu Road Transport Corporation vs. National Insurance Company 2013 (4) RCR, Civil, 273 . Therefore, it is concluded that all the respondents are liable to pay the amount of compensation to the petitioners jointly and severally. Hence, this issue is partly decided in favour of the petitioners. IN MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT, PRESIDED OVER BY SUSHIL KUMAR, ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, SONEPAT. UID No. HR-0077 MACP/CIS No. 567 of 22.11.2015 Smt. Sarita etc. vs. Santlal etc. D.O.D. 01.08.2017 10 ISSUE NO. 3:- 20. The onus to prove this issue is on the respondents, but this issue was not pressed by the Ld. Counsel for the respondents during course of arguments. Hence, this issue is decided against the respondents being not pressed. ISSUE NO. 4 :- 21.In view of my findings on issue no.2, it has been held that the insurance company is liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. Therefore, this issue is decided against the respondent no.3. RELIEF:- 22.In view of my above discussion on the aforesaid issues, claim petition is partly allowed with costs in favour of the petitioners and against the respondents. The respondents are directed to pay compensation of Rs.14,49,000/- only (Rs. Fourteen Lacs & Forty Nine Thousands only) to the petitioners along with interest @ 7% p.a. from the date of the institution of the petition till realisation. Out of the amount of compensation, the petitioner no.1, being widow of the deceased, will be entitled to 40% share. The petitioner no. 2, being minor son of the deceased, will be entitled to 30% share. The petitioner no.3, being father of the deceased, will be entitled to 10% share. The petitioner no.4, being mother of the deceased, will be entitled to 20 share. The respondents are directed to deposit the amount of compensation in the bank accounts of the petitioners if the bank account IN MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT, PRESIDED OVER BY SUSHIL KUMAR, ADDITIONAL DISTRICT JUDGE, SONEPAT.

Thereafter, respondents closed their evidence vide separate statement. 17.No evidence in rebuttal evidence was led by the petitioners. 18.I have gone through the case file very carefully and minutely and heard the arguments put-forth by both the sides. My issue-wise findings are as under - ISSUE No. 1 : 19. Onus to prove this issue was upon the petitioners. Initiating arguments, learned counsel for the claimants/petitioners vehemently IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 21 contended that petitioners Anita, Rakhi, Mother of petitioner Kajal namely Tarawati, mother of petitioner Deepak namely Sapna, petitioner Pooja and petitioner Prem who appeared as PW1 to PW6 respectively categorically deposed that on 23.02.2015 when deceased Vijaypal, Vimlesh and Asha and injured Prem, Kajal, Deepak and Pooja were traveling in van bearing registration No. DL-5CK-4669 and had reached near Murthal over-bridge in the area of Police Station, Murthal, Sonepat, respondent No. 1 who was driving the offending vehicle i.e. Gas Tanker bearing registration No. HR- 38E-6594 in a rash and negligent manner applied sudden breaks as a result of which Maruti Van dashed into the tanker. He further urged that statements of afore-mentioned witnesses are supported by FIR Ex. P17, police report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex. P18, PMR reports Ex. P1, Ex. P2 and Ex. P16, discharge cards Ex. P3, Ex. P6, Ex. P9 and Ex. P15 and medical bills Ex. P4, Ex. P5, Ex. P7, Ex. P8, Ex. P10 to Ex. P14. Thus, he submitted that it is well established that the accident in question was caused due to rash and negligent driving of Tanker bearing registration No. HR- 38E-6594 by respondent No. 1 and while passengers in the Maruti Van namely Vijaypal, Vimlesh, Asha died due to the injuries suffered by them in the accident, other passengers namely Prem, Kajal, Deepak and Pooja suffered multiple injuries. IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 22 20.On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents No.1 & 2 vehemently argued that no accident took place with Tanker bearing registration No. HR-38E-6594 and respondent No. 1 was falsely implicated in the criminal case bearing FIR No. 84 dated 24.02.2015, under Sections 279, 337, 38, 304A IPC, P.S. Murthal. Hence, prayed that all the claim petitions are liable to be dismissed. 21.I have given thoughtful consideration to the arguments put forth by both sides. It is pertinent to note that PW2 Rakhi and PW5 Pooja who had sustained injuries in the accident in question and PW6 Prem who is eye- witness to the accident being passenger in the accidental van specifically deposed that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of Tanker bearing registration No. HR-38E-6594 by respondent No.1 because he applied sudden breaks as a result of which the Maruti Van which was behind the tanker dashed against the tanker. It is also noteworthy that the FIR Ex. P17 regarding the accident was registered on the basis of statement of one eye-witness Amit on the same day and it is recorded in the FIR that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of the above-said tanker. It is further significant to note that during investigation the police found the version of the FIR as correct and filed final report against respondent No. 1 which is Ex. P18. It is also worthwhile to note that IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 23 respondent No.1 did not step into the witness box to rebut the version of the claimants/ petitioners. At this juncture, I may also observe that it is well settled law that proceedings before the MACT are of summary nature and standard of proof in such proceedings is neither preponderance of probabilities as required in a civil case nor proof beyond reasonable doubt as required in criminal trial and for such proceedings the documents prepared by the police may be taken on their face value. For this purpose, reference with advantage is made to law laid down by our Hon'ble Division Bench in “Paramjit Kaur and others versus Nahar Singh and Others” FAO 8848 of 2014 (O&M) and “United India Insurance Company Ltd. Versus Nahar Singh and Others FAO No. 9115 of 2014 (O&M). In given scenario, I am of the considered opinion that it is well proved for the purpose of instant proceedings that the accident in question was caused by respondent No. 1 while driving tanker bearing registration No. HR-38E- 6594 in a rash and negligent manner. 22.It is further important to note that PW2 Rakhi and PW5 Pooja who have sustained injuries in the accident in question and PW6 Prem who is eye-witness categorically testified that Vijaypal, Vimlesh and Asha died due to injuries suffered in the accident while Pooja, Rakhi, Kajal and Deepak suffered injuries. It is also important to note that their depositions IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 24 are corroborated from post-mortem reports Ex. P1, Ex. P2 and Ex. P16 and discharge card with medical bills of injured Rakhi Ex. P3 to Ex. P5, discharge card read with medical bills of Kajal Ex. P6 to Ex. P8, discharge card read with medical bills of Deepak Ex. P9 to Ex.P11 and medical bills and discharge card of Pooja Ex. P12 to Ex. P15. Consequently, it is cogently established that while Vijaypal, Vimlesh and Asha died due to the injuries suffered in the accident, minor Kajal, Rakhi, Pooja and Deepak suffered injuries in the accident. 23.In view of the above discussion, this issue is decided in favour of the claimants/ petitioners and against the respondents. I SSUE No. 2(in all claim petitions) - 24.The onus to prove this issue was upon the claimants/ petitioners. In his arguments learned counsel for the claimants/ petitioners submitted that in view of the statements of Anita, Rakhi, Mother of injured Kajal namely Tarawati, mother of petitioner Deepak namely Sapna, petitioner Pooja and petitioner Prem who appeared as PW1 to PW6 respectively regarding the income and age of the deceased namely Vijaypal, Vimlesh and Asha and injureds Rakhi, Kajal, Pooja and Deepak, the compensation prayed for by the claimants/ petitioners are just and reasonable and may kindly be granted. IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 25 25.On the contrary, learned counsel for the respondents stated that the compensation demanded by the claimants/ petitioners is highly excessive and exorbitant. Furthermore, learned counsel for the respondent No. 3 urged that respondent No. 1 who was driver of the offending tanker bearing registration No. HR-38E-6594 is having two driving licence i.e. one issued by Licencing Authority, RTA, Palwal Ex. RW1/A & D, which was initially valid upto 06.01.2014 and subsequently, renewed from 01.07.2016 till 30.06.2019 while the other driving licence Ex. R1/1 was issued by Regional Transport Officer, Kohima, Nagaland and was valid from 17.11.2014 to 16.11.2017. According to him, the driving licence of respondent No. 1 Ex. R1 is fake and has been procured and produced with mala-fide intention to transfer the liability to pay compensation upon the Insurance Company. He referred to law laid down by our own Hon'ble High Court in Oriental Insurance Com. Ltd. Vs. Nahar Singh and Others FAO NO. 9115 of 2014 (O& M) D.O.D. 21.02.2017. Therefore, he contended that in the circumstances, respondent No. 3 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimants/ petitioners. 26. I have given thoughtful consideration to the submissions made by both sides. As regards the amount of compensation payable in claim petition No. 356 of 2017 titled as ' Anita etc. versus Sant Lal & Others', it IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 26 is pertinent to note that claimants have claimed a compensation of 50 Lacs ₹ on account of death of Vijay Pal in the accident in question. It is further imperative to note that even though, claimant Anita has stated in her affidavit Ex. PW1/A that deceased Vijay Pal was mason by profession and was earning 20,000/- per month but neither any independent witness in ₹ support of such statement has been examined nor any documentary proof to substantiate the said claim has been produced. Accordingly, the income of deceased Vijaypal at the time of his death i.e. on 24.02.2015 can be reasonably inferred at the rate equivalent to minimum wages prevalent at that time i.e. 6,000/- per month. It is also noteworthy that as per the ₹ claimants/petitioners, deceased Vijaypal has left behind a wife, three minor children, father and mother. It is further relevant to mention that father is a second class heir. Moreover, he is supposed to have his own income and there is nothing on file except the bald statement of PW1 Anita that father of deceased Vijaypal was dependent upon him. It is also important to note that in Sarla Verma & Others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & others, 2009 (3) RCR (Civil) 77 , the Hon'ble apex Court ruled that “ Further, subject to evidence to the contrary, the father is likely to have his own income and will not be considered as a dependent and the mother alone will be considered as a dependent” . Thus, the father of deceased Vijaypal IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 27 cannot be considered as dependent on the deceased. Accordingly, there were five dependents on deceased Vijaypal. Hence, 1/4th income of the deceased is liable to be deducted towards personal expenses as per decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Smt. Sarla Verma's case (Supra) . Therefore, the loss of income comes to 54,000/- per annum. At this juncture, I may also observe ₹ that as per post-mortem report , the age of deceased Vijaypal was about 40 years. Therefore, the multiplier of 15 would be applicable. Resultantly, the loss of dependency comes to 54,000/- x 15 = 8,10,000/- (Rupees Eight ₹ Lacs and Ten Thousand Only). 27.Another important aspect of the matter is that since deceased Vijaypal was self employed an addition of 40% of the income is permissible under the Head “Future Prospects” , which comes to 3,24,000/-. ₹ 28.In addition to the above said- amount, the claimants/ petitioners are further entitled to a mount of 15,000/- each ₹ towards loss of estate and funeral expenses of deceased. Moreover, claimants are also entitled to additional amount of 40,000/- under the head of ₹ loss of consortium . Therefore, the total amount of compensation thus comes to 12,04,000/- ₹ out of which claimant No. 1 will be entitled to 40% of the total amount of compensation being widow of deceased Vijaypal while other claimants No. 2 to 4 being sons and daughters of the deceased and claimant No. 6 being IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT.

In₹ this regard, it is imperative to note that even though, claimant Prem has stated in his affidavit Ex. PW6/A that deceased Vimlesh was labourer by profession and was earning 15,000/- per month but neither any ₹ independent witness in support of such statement has been examined nor any documentary proof to substantiate the said claim has been produced. Accordingly, the income of deceased Vimlesh at the time of her death i.e. on 24.02.2015 can be reasonably inferred at the rate equivalent to minimum wages prevalent at that time i.e. 6,000/- per month. It is also noteworthy ₹ that as per the claimants/petitioners, deceased Vimlesh has left behind her husband and four children. Accordingly, there were five dependents on deceased Vimlesh. Hence, 1/4th income of the deceased is liable to be deducted towards personal expenses as per decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Smt. Sarla Verm's case (Supra) . Therefore, the loss of income comes to 54,000/- per annum. At this juncture, I may also observe that as ₹ per post-mortem report , the age of deceased Vimlesh was about 40 years. IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs.

Resultantly, the loss of dependency comes to 54,000/- x 15 = 8,10,000/- (Rupees Eight Lacs and ₹ Ten Thousand Only). 30.Another important aspect of the matter is that since deceased Vimlesh was self employed an addition of 40% of the income is permissible under the Head “ Future Prospects” which comes to 3,24,000/-. ₹ 31.In addition to the above said- amount, the claimants/ petitioners are further entitled to a mount of 15,000/- each towards ₹ loss of estate and funeral expenses of the deceased. Moreover, claimants are also entitled to additional amount of 40,000/- under the head of ₹ loss of consortium . Therefore, the total amount of compensation comes to 12,04,000/- out of ₹ which claimant No. 1 will be entitled to 40% of the total amount of compensation being husband of deceased Vimlesh while other claimants being sons and daughter of the deceased are entitled to 15% each of the total amount of compensation. 32.In claim petition No. 358, titled as “Anita Versus Sant Lal & Others” it is important to note that as per the case set-up by the claimant/ petitioner, deceased Asha was a student of 5th standard at the time of her death. Thus, her notional income can be taken as 30,000/- per annum and ₹ multiplier of “'15” would be applicable. In this regard, reliance is placed IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs.

Resultantly, the loss of income comes to 30,000/- x 15 = 4,50,000/- ₹ (Rupees Four Lacs and Fifty Thousand Only). 33. In addition to the above said amount, the claimant/ petitioner is further entitled to amount of 15,000/- towards ₹ loss of estate and funeral expenses of the deceased. Thus, total compensation comes to 4, ₹ 80,000/-. 34. In claim petition No. 359, titled as “Deepak Versus Sant Lal & Others” it is worthwhile to note that injured Deepak has claimed a compensation of Five Lacs on account of injuries suffered by him in the ₹ accident in question. It is further significant to note that the discharge card of injured Deepak is Ex. P9 wherein it is recorded that he remained admitted in PGIMS, Rohtak from 24.02.2015 to 26.02.2015. It is also relevant to note that the medical bills of the injured in the sum of 14,614/- and 6709/- ₹ ₹ respectively have been proved as Ex. P10 and Ex. P11. Therefore, I am of the considered view that claimant Deepak is entitled to 21,323/- under the ₹ Head “Medical Expenses” . 35.Furthermore, since the accident in question occurred on National Highway within the jurisdiction of District Sonepat and the IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT.

Moreover, as discussed above the injured remained admitted in PGIMS, Rohtak for two days. Accordingly, he must have spent some amount on special diet. Therefore, I am of the considered view that in the absence of any proof of the amount actually spent by the claimant on special diet and transportation, the sum can be reasonably assessed in view of nature of injuries suffered by the claimant as 3,000/-. ₹ 36. It is also important to mention that in view of nature of injuries suffered by him as mentioned in the discharge card Ex. P9, the claimant is also entitled to a reasonable amount under the Head “Pain and Sufferings” which in my opinion comes to 8,000/-. Thus, the total amount of ₹ compensation comes to 32, 323/-. ₹ 37. In claim petition No. 360 titled as “Rakhi Versus Sant Lal & Others” it is worthwhile to note that injured Rakhi has claimed a compensation of Ten Lacs on account of injuries suffered by her in the ₹ accident in question. It is also important to note that the discharge card of injured Rakhi is Ex. P3 wherein it is recorded that she remained admitted in PGIMS, Rohtak from 24.02.2015 to 26.02.2015.

Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 32 respectively have been proved as Ex. P4 and Ex. P5. Therefore, I am of the considered view that claimant Rakhi is entitled to 36,855/- under the Head ₹ “Medical Expenses”. 38.It is also pertinent to note that since the accident in question occurred on National Highway within the jurisdiction of District Sonepat and the claimant was treated in PGIMS, Rohtak, it can be safely assumed that the claimant would have incurred expenses on transportation. Moreover, as already discussed above the claimant remained admitted in PGIMS, Rohtak for two days. Accordingly, she must have spent some amount on special diet. Therefore, I am of the considered view that in the absence of any proof of the amount actually spent by the claimant on special diet and transportation, the sum can be reasonably assessed in view of nature of injuries of the claimant as 8,000/-. ₹ 39. It is also important to mention that as per discharge card Ex. P3, the injured suffered three multiple fractures. Consequently, in view of nature of injuries suffered by her, the claimant is also entitled to a reasonable amount under the Head “Pain and Sufferings” which in my opinion comes to 25,000/-. ₹ 40.At this juncture, I may also observe that claimant Rakhi when appeared into witness-box as PW2 has stated that at the time of accident, she IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT.

However, neither any independent witness has been examined nor any documentary evidence has been led in order to substantiate the said claim. So, no amount is granted to claimant Rakhi on account of loss of earnings. Hence, the total amount of compensation comes to 69,855/-.₹ 41. In claim petition No. 361 titled as “Kajal Versus Sant Lal & Others” it is worthwhile to note that injured Kajal has claimed a compensation of Five Lacs on account of injuries suffered by her in the ₹ accident in question.

Thus, the total amount of compensation comes to 87,093/-.₹ ₹ 47.Now, the question is regarding who is liable to pay compensation. In this regard, it is imperative to note that respondent No.1, who was driver of the offending vehicle at the time of accident is having two IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 36 driving licences i.e. driving licence Ex. RW1/B & D which was initially valid from 07.12.2005 to 06.01.2014 for transport vehicles and which has been subsequently renewed for the period 01.07.2016 to 30.06.2019 as per deposition of RW2 Rajender Singh, Transport Inspector, RTA, Palwal and driving licence Ex. R1/1 which is issued by Regional Transport Officer, Kohima, Nagaland which was valid from 17.11.2014 to 16.11.2017. It is further significant to mention that keeping in view the fact that respondent No. 1 has two licences, this Tribunal summoned the file of criminal case regarding FIR No. 85 of 2015, under Sections 279, 337, 338, 304A, IPC, Police Station, Murthal so as to ascertain which driving licence was handed over to the police during investigation of that case and a perusal of the file of the criminal case revealed that during the investigation, a copy of driving licence Ex. RW1/B & D was handed over to the police as the original of the same was already placed on the file of case bearing FIR No. 218 dated 01.08.2013, under sections 279 and 304 A IPC, P.S. Kharkhoda. Hence, it is crystal clear that respondent No. 1 relied upon driving licence issued by Licencing Authority, Palwal in the criminal case registered against him regarding the accident in question. However, during instant proceedings, he alongwith owner of the offending vehicle have relied upon driving licence Ex. R1/1 which is issued by the Regional Transport Officer, Kohima, IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 37 Nagland. As already discussed above, the driving licence Ex. RW1/B & D was not valid on the day of accident. At this juncture, I may also observe that the possibility of obtaining a driving licence by respondent No. 1 from the State of Nagaland after expiry of his driving licence Ex. RW1/B & D for future purposes is ruled out from the fact that he got his licence Ex. RW1/B & D renewed from 01.07.2016 to 30.06.2019 because if respondent No. 1 had taken licence Ex. R1/1 from the State of Nagaland in view of the fact that his earlier driving licence Ex. RW1/B & D had expired, he would not have got his said licence renewed during the validity of licence Ex. R1/1. It is further important to note that respondent No. 1 is local resident of Palwal. Thus, there was no reason for him to apply and get his driving licence from the State of Nagaland. In similar circumstances, our own Hon'ble High Court in case titled as Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. Versus Nahar Singh and Other's case (Supra) while taking note of Section 6 (I) of the M.V. Act 1998, which prohibits any person from holding more than one driving licence held “that the licence produced by the driver subsequently had been issued from Nagaland, which is not the ordinary place of residence of the driver, therefore, the Court can take notice of this fact that the licence has been managed from a different area with a view to overcome the liability in such cases. The driver could not hold two licences and the IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs.

Sant Lal & others. 38 first licence did not authorize him to drive the vehicle. Therefore, the insurance company could not have been made liable.” 48.In these facts and circumstances of the case, it can be safely concluded that the insurance company-respondent No. 3 is not liable to indemnify the insured. Consequently, the respondent No.1, who was driver of the offending vehicle and respondent No. 2 who is the owner of the offending vehicle are held jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation to the claimants/ petitioners. However, respondent No. 3 i.e. insurance company shall be liable to pay the compensation to the claimants/ petitioners with liberty to recover the same from respondents No. 1 & 2 as per decision of Hon'ble apex Court in National Insurance Company Ltd. Versus Swaran Singh and others I (2004) CLT 1. 49. Both these issues stand disposed of in view of above observations accordingly. ISSUES No. 3 & 4 (in all petitions) - 50.In view of discussion above, it is held that insurance company shall deposit the amount of compensation in the first instance and shall remain at liberty to recover the said amount from the insured, either in the execution filed by the claimant himself/ herself or by moving separate IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT.

ISSUE NO. 5 (RELIEF) 51.Keeping in view of my findings on aforesaid issues, all the above-titled claim petitions succeeds and is allowed with costs. Respondent No. 3 is directed to deposite the amount of compensation in the bank accounts of major claimants on submission of particulars of their bank accounts alongwith their pass-books within 15 days failing which the amount shall be deposited by way of demand draft/cheque in the name of claimants within three months.

Thereafter, respondents closed their evidence vide separate statement. 17.No evidence in rebuttal evidence was led by the petitioners. 18.I have gone through the case file very carefully and minutely and heard the arguments put-forth by both the sides. My issue-wise findings are as under - ISSUE No. 1 : 19. Onus to prove this issue was upon the petitioners. Initiating arguments, learned counsel for the claimants/petitioners vehemently IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 21 contended that petitioners Anita, Rakhi, Mother of petitioner Kajal namely Tarawati, mother of petitioner Deepak namely Sapna, petitioner Pooja and petitioner Prem who appeared as PW1 to PW6 respectively categorically deposed that on 23.02.2015 when deceased Vijaypal, Vimlesh and Asha and injured Prem, Kajal, Deepak and Pooja were traveling in van bearing registration No. DL-5CK-4669 and had reached near Murthal over-bridge in the area of Police Station, Murthal, Sonepat, respondent No. 1 who was driving the offending vehicle i.e. Gas Tanker bearing registration No. HR- 38E-6594 in a rash and negligent manner applied sudden breaks as a result of which Maruti Van dashed into the tanker. He further urged that statements of afore-mentioned witnesses are supported by FIR Ex. P17, police report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex. P18, PMR reports Ex. P1, Ex. P2 and Ex. P16, discharge cards Ex. P3, Ex. P6, Ex. P9 and Ex. P15 and medical bills Ex. P4, Ex. P5, Ex. P7, Ex. P8, Ex. P10 to Ex. P14. Thus, he submitted that it is well established that the accident in question was caused due to rash and negligent driving of Tanker bearing registration No. HR- 38E-6594 by respondent No. 1 and while passengers in the Maruti Van namely Vijaypal, Vimlesh, Asha died due to the injuries suffered by them in the accident, other passengers namely Prem, Kajal, Deepak and Pooja suffered multiple injuries. IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 22 20.On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondents No.1 & 2 vehemently argued that no accident took place with Tanker bearing registration No. HR-38E-6594 and respondent No. 1 was falsely implicated in the criminal case bearing FIR No. 84 dated 24.02.2015, under Sections 279, 337, 38, 304A IPC, P.S. Murthal. Hence, prayed that all the claim petitions are liable to be dismissed. 21.I have given thoughtful consideration to the arguments put forth by both sides. It is pertinent to note that PW2 Rakhi and PW5 Pooja who had sustained injuries in the accident in question and PW6 Prem who is eye- witness to the accident being passenger in the accidental van specifically deposed that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of Tanker bearing registration No. HR-38E-6594 by respondent No.1 because he applied sudden breaks as a result of which the Maruti Van which was behind the tanker dashed against the tanker. It is also noteworthy that the FIR Ex. P17 regarding the accident was registered on the basis of statement of one eye-witness Amit on the same day and it is recorded in the FIR that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of the above-said tanker. It is further significant to note that during investigation the police found the version of the FIR as correct and filed final report against respondent No. 1 which is Ex. P18. It is also worthwhile to note that IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 23 respondent No.1 did not step into the witness box to rebut the version of the claimants/ petitioners. At this juncture, I may also observe that it is well settled law that proceedings before the MACT are of summary nature and standard of proof in such proceedings is neither preponderance of probabilities as required in a civil case nor proof beyond reasonable doubt as required in criminal trial and for such proceedings the documents prepared by the police may be taken on their face value. For this purpose, reference with advantage is made to law laid down by our Hon'ble Division Bench in “Paramjit Kaur and others versus Nahar Singh and Others” FAO 8848 of 2014 (O&M) and “United India Insurance Company Ltd. Versus Nahar Singh and Others FAO No. 9115 of 2014 (O&M). In given scenario, I am of the considered opinion that it is well proved for the purpose of instant proceedings that the accident in question was caused by respondent No. 1 while driving tanker bearing registration No. HR-38E- 6594 in a rash and negligent manner. 22.It is further important to note that PW2 Rakhi and PW5 Pooja who have sustained injuries in the accident in question and PW6 Prem who is eye-witness categorically testified that Vijaypal, Vimlesh and Asha died due to injuries suffered in the accident while Pooja, Rakhi, Kajal and Deepak suffered injuries. It is also important to note that their depositions IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 24 are corroborated from post-mortem reports Ex. P1, Ex. P2 and Ex. P16 and discharge card with medical bills of injured Rakhi Ex. P3 to Ex. P5, discharge card read with medical bills of Kajal Ex. P6 to Ex. P8, discharge card read with medical bills of Deepak Ex. P9 to Ex.P11 and medical bills and discharge card of Pooja Ex. P12 to Ex. P15. Consequently, it is cogently established that while Vijaypal, Vimlesh and Asha died due to the injuries suffered in the accident, minor Kajal, Rakhi, Pooja and Deepak suffered injuries in the accident. 23.In view of the above discussion, this issue is decided in favour of the claimants/ petitioners and against the respondents. I SSUE No. 2(in all claim petitions) - 24.The onus to prove this issue was upon the claimants/ petitioners. In his arguments learned counsel for the claimants/ petitioners submitted that in view of the statements of Anita, Rakhi, Mother of injured Kajal namely Tarawati, mother of petitioner Deepak namely Sapna, petitioner Pooja and petitioner Prem who appeared as PW1 to PW6 respectively regarding the income and age of the deceased namely Vijaypal, Vimlesh and Asha and injureds Rakhi, Kajal, Pooja and Deepak, the compensation prayed for by the claimants/ petitioners are just and reasonable and may kindly be granted. IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 25 25.On the contrary, learned counsel for the respondents stated that the compensation demanded by the claimants/ petitioners is highly excessive and exorbitant. Furthermore, learned counsel for the respondent No. 3 urged that respondent No. 1 who was driver of the offending tanker bearing registration No. HR-38E-6594 is having two driving licence i.e. one issued by Licencing Authority, RTA, Palwal Ex. RW1/A & D, which was initially valid upto 06.01.2014 and subsequently, renewed from 01.07.2016 till 30.06.2019 while the other driving licence Ex. R1/1 was issued by Regional Transport Officer, Kohima, Nagaland and was valid from 17.11.2014 to 16.11.2017. According to him, the driving licence of respondent No. 1 Ex. R1 is fake and has been procured and produced with mala-fide intention to transfer the liability to pay compensation upon the Insurance Company. He referred to law laid down by our own Hon'ble High Court in Oriental Insurance Com. Ltd. Vs. Nahar Singh and Others FAO NO. 9115 of 2014 (O& M) D.O.D. 21.02.2017. Therefore, he contended that in the circumstances, respondent No. 3 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimants/ petitioners. 26. I have given thoughtful consideration to the submissions made by both sides. As regards the amount of compensation payable in claim petition No. 356 of 2017 titled as ' Anita etc. versus Sant Lal & Others', it IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 26 is pertinent to note that claimants have claimed a compensation of 50 Lacs ₹ on account of death of Vijay Pal in the accident in question. It is further imperative to note that even though, claimant Anita has stated in her affidavit Ex. PW1/A that deceased Vijay Pal was mason by profession and was earning 20,000/- per month but neither any independent witness in ₹ support of such statement has been examined nor any documentary proof to substantiate the said claim has been produced. Accordingly, the income of deceased Vijaypal at the time of his death i.e. on 24.02.2015 can be reasonably inferred at the rate equivalent to minimum wages prevalent at that time i.e. 6,000/- per month. It is also noteworthy that as per the ₹ claimants/petitioners, deceased Vijaypal has left behind a wife, three minor children, father and mother. It is further relevant to mention that father is a second class heir. Moreover, he is supposed to have his own income and there is nothing on file except the bald statement of PW1 Anita that father of deceased Vijaypal was dependent upon him. It is also important to note that in Sarla Verma & Others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & others, 2009 (3) RCR (Civil) 77 , the Hon'ble apex Court ruled that “ Further, subject to evidence to the contrary, the father is likely to have his own income and will not be considered as a dependent and the mother alone will be considered as a dependent” . Thus, the father of deceased Vijaypal IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 27 cannot be considered as dependent on the deceased. Accordingly, there were five dependents on deceased Vijaypal. Hence, 1/4th income of the deceased is liable to be deducted towards personal expenses as per decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Smt. Sarla Verma's case (Supra) . Therefore, the loss of income comes to 54,000/- per annum. At this juncture, I may also observe ₹ that as per post-mortem report , the age of deceased Vijaypal was about 40 years. Therefore, the multiplier of 15 would be applicable. Resultantly, the loss of dependency comes to 54,000/- x 15 = 8,10,000/- (Rupees Eight ₹ Lacs and Ten Thousand Only). 27.Another important aspect of the matter is that since deceased Vijaypal was self employed an addition of 40% of the income is permissible under the Head “Future Prospects” , which comes to 3,24,000/-. ₹ 28.In addition to the above said- amount, the claimants/ petitioners are further entitled to a mount of 15,000/- each ₹ towards loss of estate and funeral expenses of deceased. Moreover, claimants are also entitled to additional amount of 40,000/- under the head of ₹ loss of consortium . Therefore, the total amount of compensation thus comes to 12,04,000/- ₹ out of which claimant No. 1 will be entitled to 40% of the total amount of compensation being widow of deceased Vijaypal while other claimants No. 2 to 4 being sons and daughters of the deceased and claimant No. 6 being IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 28 mother of the deceased are entitled to 15% each of the total amount of compensation. 29.In claim petition No. 357, titled as “Prem & Others Versus Sant Lal & Others” the claimants/ petitioners have claimed a compensation of 50 Lacs on account of death of Vimlesh in the accident in question. In₹ this regard, it is imperative to note that even though, claimant Prem has stated in his affidavit Ex. PW6/A that deceased Vimlesh was labourer by profession and was earning 15,000/- per month but neither any ₹ independent witness in support of such statement has been examined nor any documentary proof to substantiate the said claim has been produced. Accordingly, the income of deceased Vimlesh at the time of her death i.e. on 24.02.2015 can be reasonably inferred at the rate equivalent to minimum wages prevalent at that time i.e. 6,000/- per month. It is also noteworthy ₹ that as per the claimants/petitioners, deceased Vimlesh has left behind her husband and four children. Accordingly, there were five dependents on deceased Vimlesh. Hence, 1/4th income of the deceased is liable to be deducted towards personal expenses as per decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Smt. Sarla Verm's case (Supra) . Therefore, the loss of income comes to 54,000/- per annum. At this juncture, I may also observe that as ₹ per post-mortem report , the age of deceased Vimlesh was about 40 years. IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 29 Therefore, the multiplier of '15' would be applicable. Resultantly, the loss of dependency comes to 54,000/- x 15 = 8,10,000/- (Rupees Eight Lacs and ₹ Ten Thousand Only). 30.Another important aspect of the matter is that since deceased Vimlesh was self employed an addition of 40% of the income is permissible under the Head “ Future Prospects” which comes to 3,24,000/-. ₹ 31.In addition to the above said- amount, the claimants/ petitioners are further entitled to a mount of 15,000/- each towards ₹ loss of estate and funeral expenses of the deceased. Moreover, claimants are also entitled to additional amount of 40,000/- under the head of ₹ loss of consortium . Therefore, the total amount of compensation comes to 12,04,000/- out of ₹ which claimant No. 1 will be entitled to 40% of the total amount of compensation being husband of deceased Vimlesh while other claimants being sons and daughter of the deceased are entitled to 15% each of the total amount of compensation. 32.In claim petition No. 358, titled as “Anita Versus Sant Lal & Others” it is important to note that as per the case set-up by the claimant/ petitioner, deceased Asha was a student of 5th standard at the time of her death. Thus, her notional income can be taken as 30,000/- per annum and ₹ multiplier of “'15” would be applicable. In this regard, reliance is placed IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 30 upon the law laid down by our own Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Krishan Gopal and others Versus Lala and others 2013 (4) RCR (Civil) 276. Resultantly, the loss of income comes to 30,000/- x 15 = 4,50,000/- ₹ (Rupees Four Lacs and Fifty Thousand Only). 33. In addition to the above said amount, the claimant/ petitioner is further entitled to amount of 15,000/- towards ₹ loss of estate and funeral expenses of the deceased. Thus, total compensation comes to 4, ₹ 80,000/-. 34. In claim petition No. 359, titled as “Deepak Versus Sant Lal & Others” it is worthwhile to note that injured Deepak has claimed a compensation of Five Lacs on account of injuries suffered by him in the ₹ accident in question. It is further significant to note that the discharge card of injured Deepak is Ex. P9 wherein it is recorded that he remained admitted in PGIMS, Rohtak from 24.02.2015 to 26.02.2015. It is also relevant to note that the medical bills of the injured in the sum of 14,614/- and 6709/- ₹ ₹ respectively have been proved as Ex. P10 and Ex. P11. Therefore, I am of the considered view that claimant Deepak is entitled to 21,323/- under the ₹ Head “Medical Expenses” . 35.Furthermore, since the accident in question occurred on National Highway within the jurisdiction of District Sonepat and the IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 31 claimant was treated in PGIMS, Rohtak, it can be safely assumed that the claimant would have incurred expenses on transportation. Moreover, as discussed above the injured remained admitted in PGIMS, Rohtak for two days. Accordingly, he must have spent some amount on special diet. Therefore, I am of the considered view that in the absence of any proof of the amount actually spent by the claimant on special diet and transportation, the sum can be reasonably assessed in view of nature of injuries suffered by the claimant as 3,000/-. ₹ 36. It is also important to mention that in view of nature of injuries suffered by him as mentioned in the discharge card Ex. P9, the claimant is also entitled to a reasonable amount under the Head “Pain and Sufferings” which in my opinion comes to 8,000/-. Thus, the total amount of ₹ compensation comes to 32, 323/-. ₹ 37. In claim petition No. 360 titled as “Rakhi Versus Sant Lal & Others” it is worthwhile to note that injured Rakhi has claimed a compensation of Ten Lacs on account of injuries suffered by her in the ₹ accident in question. It is also important to note that the discharge card of injured Rakhi is Ex. P3 wherein it is recorded that she remained admitted in PGIMS, Rohtak from 24.02.2015 to 26.02.2015. It is further relevant to note that the medical bills of the injured in the sum of 21,730/- and 15,125/- ₹ ₹ IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 32 respectively have been proved as Ex. P4 and Ex. P5. Therefore, I am of the considered view that claimant Rakhi is entitled to 36,855/- under the Head ₹ “Medical Expenses”. 38.It is also pertinent to note that since the accident in question occurred on National Highway within the jurisdiction of District Sonepat and the claimant was treated in PGIMS, Rohtak, it can be safely assumed that the claimant would have incurred expenses on transportation. Moreover, as already discussed above the claimant remained admitted in PGIMS, Rohtak for two days. Accordingly, she must have spent some amount on special diet. Therefore, I am of the considered view that in the absence of any proof of the amount actually spent by the claimant on special diet and transportation, the sum can be reasonably assessed in view of nature of injuries of the claimant as 8,000/-. ₹ 39. It is also important to mention that as per discharge card Ex. P3, the injured suffered three multiple fractures. Consequently, in view of nature of injuries suffered by her, the claimant is also entitled to a reasonable amount under the Head “Pain and Sufferings” which in my opinion comes to 25,000/-. ₹ 40.At this juncture, I may also observe that claimant Rakhi when appeared into witness-box as PW2 has stated that at the time of accident, she IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT.

However, neither any independent witness has been examined nor any documentary evidence has been led in order to substantiate the said claim. So, no amount is granted to claimant Rakhi on account of loss of earnings. Hence, the total amount of compensation comes to 69,855/-.₹ 41. In claim petition No. 361 titled as “Kajal Versus Sant Lal & Others” it is worthwhile to note that injured Kajal has claimed a compensation of Five Lacs on account of injuries suffered by her in the ₹ accident in question. It is further noteworthy to note that the discharge card of injured Kajal is Ex. P6 wherein it is recorded that she remained admitted in PGIMS, Rohtak from 24.02.2015 to 26.02.2015. It is also relevant to note that the medical bills of the injured in the sum of 20,820/- and 151/- ₹ ₹ respectively have been proved as Ex. P7 and Ex. P8. Therefore, I am of the considered view that claimant Kajal is entitled to 20,971/- under the Head ₹ “Medical Expenses”. 42.It is further imperative to note that since the accident in question occurred on National Highway within the jurisdiction of District Sonepat and the claimant was treated in PGIMS, Rohtak, it can be safely assumed that the claimant would have incurred expenses on transportation.

Therefore, I am of the considered view that in the absence of any proof of the amount actually spent by the claimant on special diet and transportation, the sum can be reasonably assessed in view of nature of injuries of the claimant as 5,000/-. ₹ 43.It is also important to mention that as per discharge card Ex. P6, the injured suffered one fracture. Consequently, in view of nature of injuries suffered by her, the claimant is also entitled to a reasonable amount under the Head “Pain and Sufferings” which in my opinion comes to 10,000/-. ₹ Thus, the total amount of compensation comes to 35,971/-. ₹ 44. In claim petition No. 362 titled as “Pooja Versus Sant Lal & Others” it is worthwhile to note that injured Pooja has claimed a compensation of Five Lacs on account of injuries suffered by her in the ₹ accident in question. It is also significant to note that the discharge card of injured Pooja is Ex. P15 wherein it is recorded that she remained admitted in PGIMS, Rohtak from 24.02.2015 to 26.02.2015. It is further relevant to note that the medical bills of the injured in the sum of 23,097/-, 30,464/- and ₹ ₹ 532/- respectively have been proved as Ex. P12, Ex. P13 and Ex. P14.₹ IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs.

Moreover, as already discussed above, she remained admitted in PGIMS, Rohtak for two days. Accordingly, she must spent some amount on special diet. Therefore, I am of the considered view that in the absence of any proof of the amount actually spent by the claimant on special diet and transportation, the sum can be reasonably assessed in view of nature of injuries suffered by her as 8,000/-. ₹ 46.It is also important to mention that as per discharge card Ex.

Consequently, in view of nature of injuries suffered by her, the claimant is also entitled to a reasonable amount under the Head “Pain and Sufferings” which in my opinion comes to 25,000/-. Thus, the total amount of compensation comes to 87,093/-.₹ ₹ 47.Now, the question is regarding who is liable to pay compensation. In this regard, it is imperative to note that respondent No.1, who was driver of the offending vehicle at the time of accident is having two IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 36 driving licences i.e. driving licence Ex. RW1/B & D which was initially valid from 07.12.2005 to 06.01.2014 for transport vehicles and which has been subsequently renewed for the period 01.07.2016 to 30.06.2019 as per deposition of RW2 Rajender Singh, Transport Inspector, RTA, Palwal and driving licence Ex. R1/1 which is issued by Regional Transport Officer, Kohima, Nagaland which was valid from 17.11.2014 to 16.11.2017. It is further significant to mention that keeping in view the fact that respondent No. 1 has two licences, this Tribunal summoned the file of criminal case regarding FIR No. 85 of 2015, under Sections 279, 337, 338, 304A, IPC, Police Station, Murthal so as to ascertain which driving licence was handed over to the police during investigation of that case and a perusal of the file of the criminal case revealed that during the investigation, a copy of driving licence Ex. RW1/B & D was handed over to the police as the original of the same was already placed on the file of case bearing FIR No. 218 dated 01.08.2013, under sections 279 and 304 A IPC, P.S. Kharkhoda. Hence, it is crystal clear that respondent No. 1 relied upon driving licence issued by Licencing Authority, Palwal in the criminal case registered against him regarding the accident in question. However, during instant proceedings, he alongwith owner of the offending vehicle have relied upon driving licence Ex. R1/1 which is issued by the Regional Transport Officer, Kohima, IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. (1+6=7) Prem etc. Vs. Sant Lal & others. Anita Vs. Sant Lal & others. Deepak Vs. Sant Lal & others. Rakhi Vs. Sant Lal & others. Kajal Vs. Sant Lal & others. Pooja Vs. Sant Lal & others. 37 Nagland. As already discussed above, the driving licence Ex. RW1/B & D was not valid on the day of accident. At this juncture, I may also observe that the possibility of obtaining a driving licence by respondent No. 1 from the State of Nagaland after expiry of his driving licence Ex. RW1/B & D for future purposes is ruled out from the fact that he got his licence Ex. RW1/B & D renewed from 01.07.2016 to 30.06.2019 because if respondent No. 1 had taken licence Ex. R1/1 from the State of Nagaland in view of the fact that his earlier driving licence Ex. RW1/B & D had expired, he would not have got his said licence renewed during the validity of licence Ex. R1/1. It is further important to note that respondent No. 1 is local resident of Palwal. Thus, there was no reason for him to apply and get his driving licence from the State of Nagaland. In similar circumstances, our own Hon'ble High Court in case titled as Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. Versus Nahar Singh and Other's case (Supra) while taking note of Section 6 (I) of the M.V. Act 1998, which prohibits any person from holding more than one driving licence held “that the licence produced by the driver subsequently had been issued from Nagaland, which is not the ordinary place of residence of the driver, therefore, the Court can take notice of this fact that the licence has been managed from a different area with a view to overcome the liability in such cases. The driver could not hold two licences and the IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 356, 357, 358, 359, 360, 361 & 362 of 28.10.2017 Anita etc. Vs.

Therefore, the insurance company could not have been made liable.” 48.In these facts and circumstances of the case, it can be safely concluded that the insurance company-respondent No. 3 is not liable to indemnify the insured. Consequently, the respondent No.1, who was driver of the offending vehicle and respondent No. 2 who is the owner of the offending vehicle are held jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation to the claimants/ petitioners. However, respondent No. 3 i.e. insurance company shall be liable to pay the compensation to the claimants/ petitioners with liberty to recover the same from respondents No. 1 & 2 as per decision of Hon'ble apex Court in National Insurance Company Ltd. Versus Swaran Singh and others I (2004) CLT 1. 49. Both these issues stand disposed of in view of above observations accordingly. ISSUES No. 3 & 4 (in all petitions) - 50.In view of discussion above, it is held that insurance company shall deposit the amount of compensation in the first instance and shall remain at liberty to recover the said amount from the insured, either in the execution filed by the claimant himself/ herself or by moving separate IN THE COURT OF RAJESH GUPTA, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT.

Respondents No. 1 & 2 already ex parte. Shri Ajay Sehrawat, Advocate for respondent No.3. AWARD : Present claim petition has been filed by the petitioner on account of the injuries suffered by him in a Motor Vehicular Accident which took 2 MACT Case No.418 of 2015. Ramesh Versus Bhupender & ors. place on 02.12.2014 at about 11.50 p.m. near Radhey – Radhey Dhaba in front of Petrol Pump on National High Way due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle bearing registration No.RJ-26-GA-0720 (hereinafter be referred to as an offending vehicle) by the respondent No.1. 2.It is the case of claimant that on 02.12.2014 the claimant was going to his village Busana from Gohana on his motor-cycle bearing registration No.HR-11-F-3102 and when he reached near Radhey- Radhey Dhaba in front of Petrol Pump on National way No.709, a truck being driven at a high speed and in rash and negligent manner came from opposite side and directly struck against the injured. As a result of which, the accident took place. The injured fell down and sustained injuries. The truck was got stopped and the injured noticed the registration number of the truck as RJ-26-GA- 0720. It was pleaded that after the accident, the driver of the truck fled away from the spot after leaving the truck at the spot. The petition got his statement recorded to the police and on the basis of his statement FIR No.389 under Sections 279 & 337 IPC in Police Station Sadar, Gohana, was registered on 03.12.2014 against respondent No.1. It was pleaded that the respondent No.1 is facing criminal trial for causing the accident. The accident in question was the result of sole negligent driving on the part of respondent No.1. It was pleaded that firstly, the petitioner was got admitted in BPS Government Medical College for Women, Khanpur Kalan, and thereafter he was referred to PGIMS, Rohtak, where he remained admitted till 19.12.2014 and operated for fracture. It was pleaded that on account of fracture, the petitioner had 3 MACT Case No.418 of 2015. Ramesh Versus Bhupender & ors. sustained permanent disability. During the treatment a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- was spent on medicines, transportation and attendant etc. It was pleaded that the petitioner was working as Munim in a firm under the name and style of M/s Ram Kishan Ram Niwas in New Grain Market, Gohana and was getting Rs.20,000/- per month but after the accident, the petitioner is unable to work. It was pleaded that after the accident the petitioner had suffered pain and suffering besides loss of earnings. Therefore, the petitioner on account of injuries sustained in accident, has claimed compensation to the tune of Rs.twenty lacs with interest @ 24% per annum from the date of filing of petition till its realization. 3.Upon notice, none appeared on behalf of respondents No. 1 & 2. Therefore, respondent No.1 was proceeded against ex parte on 10.03.2016, whereas, respondent No.2 was proceeded against ex parte on 21.04.2016. 4.Respondent No.3 – Insurance Company appeared and contested the petition by filing written statement, in which, preliminary objections that the petition is bad for non-joinder of necessary parties, petition is not maintainable, driver of the offending vehicle was not holding valid and effective driving licence on the date of the accident and that the petitioner has no cause of action to file the present petition, were taken. 5.On merits, it was pleaded that the income of the claimant has been shown on higher side. So far as FIR is concerned, the same is a matter of record. The respondent No.1 has been falsely implicated in this case as the accident was not caused due to the alleged rash and negligent driving of 4 MACT Case No.418 of 2015. Ramesh Versus Bhupender & ors. vehicle bearing registration No.RJ-26-GA-0720 by respondent No.1. Rather the claimant had suffered injuries himself due to fall from his motor-cycle bearing registration No.HR-11-F-3102, allegedly driven by him and that the claimant was under the influence of liquor at the time of accident. It was denied that an amount of Rs.1,50,000/- was incurred by the claimant on his treatment, transportation and medicines etc. The respondents No. 1 & 2 has not supplied any documents with respect to the accident or the accidental vehicle, viz. Insurance and particulars of DL etc. and thus, has breached the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. The amount of compensation as claimed is highly exaggerated, excessive and exorbitant and without any basis. In fact, no accident took place due to rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent No.1 while driving truck bearing registration No.RJ-26- GA-0720. The accident was caused due to sole rash and negligent driving of motor-cycle bearing registration No.HR-11-F-3102 by the claimant. Refuting the other averments of the petition, a prayer has been made to dismiss the present petition. 6.No rejoinder was filed by the claimant. From the pleadings of parties, the following issues were settled for adjudication on 11.08.2016 :- 1.Whether the accident in question is resulting into causing injuries to claimant – Ramesh on 02.12.2014 at about 11.50 p.m. near Radhe-Radhey Dhaba in front of Petrol Pump on National Highway on account of motor vehicular accident due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 while driving offending vehicle bearing registration No.RJ-26-GA-0720?OPP 2.If issue No.1 is proved, whether the claimant is entitled to the amount as claimed in claim petition and from whom?

Neelam as PW-2, Shamsher Sangwan as PW -3, Dr.Ravinder Panjeta as PW -4, Dr.Amit Dahiya as PW -5, petitioner himself appeared as PW -6 and thereafter, learned counsel for the petitioner has closed the evidence on behalf of the petitioner, vide his statement recorded separately. 8.The petitioner has also tendered into evidence documents, viz. copy of FIR as Ex.PW1/A, bills of vehicles in which, the injured was taken to the hospital are Ex.P-3 to Ex.P-11, disability certificate as Ex.PW5/A, copy of MLR as Ex.PW6/C, copy of medical record as Ex.PW6/D. 9.On the other hand, no evidence on behalf of the respondents was led and ultimately, the evidence of all the respondents was closed by the order of the Tribunal. 10.I have heard the arguments on behalf of both sides and have gone through the case file. My issue-wise findings are as under : - ISSUES No.1&2 11. Both the issues are inter-connected, so, the same are taken together. Onus to prove these issues was upon the petitioner and he was required to prove that on 02.12.2014, an accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle bearing registration No.RJ-26-GA- 0720 by its driver and caused injuries to the petitioner and whether claimant is 6 MACT Case No.418 of 2015. Ramesh Versus Bhupender & ors. entitled for compensation and from whom. 12.In order to discharge his onus, petitioner has examined HC Ishwar Singh as PW -1, who had brought the summoned record pertaining to FIR No.389 dated 03.12.2014, registered at Police Station Sadar, Gohana against respondent No.1 – Bhupender and proved the same as Ex.PW1/A. 13.The petitioner has also examined Smt. Neelam as PW – 2 and she had deposed in her affidavit as Ex.PW2/A that she is proprietor of M/s Ram Kishan Ram Niwas, shop No.165 situated in New Grain Market, Gohana, District Sonipat and petitioner – Ramesh was working as Munim for the last two years and he was getting Rs.20,000/- per month as salary. She further deposed that since the day of accident, he was not working at his shop. During cross-examination, she deposed that she did not know whether her firm is registered or not. She admitted that her husband is proprietor of M/s Ram Kishan Ram Niwas Shop. She further deposed that she did not know whether the salary was paid in cash or by way of cheque. She further shown her ignorance whether Ramesh was income tax payee or not. 14.PW -3 Shamsher Sangwan has also tendered into evidence his affidavit as Ex.PW3/A and deposed that he had taken Ramesh in PGIMS Rohtak for about 20 times in his vehicle and for every visit, he had taken Rs.3,000/- per visit. During cross-examination, he admitted that bills Ex.P-3 to Ex.P-11 are not registered bill, rather the same are receipts. 15.PW -4 Dr. Ravuinder Panjeta, Medical Officer, BPSGMC, Khanpur Kalan and he deposed about the injuries sustained by petitioner 7 MACT Case No.418 of 2015. Ramesh Versus Bhupender & ors. Ramesh. During cross-examination, he admitted that such accident can be caused by use of alcohol. He further deposed that at the time of examination of injured Ramesh, Alcohol smell was present. 16.PW -5 Dr.Amit Dahiya, Medical Officer, Civil Hospital, Sonipat deposed that on 06.12.2017 he alongwith Deputy CMO and PMO, Civil Hospital, Sonipat examined Ramesh and found that the patient was a post traumatic case with RTA and on X-ray examination, the implant DHS present at right hip and plating at distal femur with knee and ankle stiffness and concluded that patient is physically disabled and has 60% temporary physical disability, which is likely to be improved with treatment. This witness proved disability certificate as Ex.PW5/A. During cross-examination, this witness admitted that if the patient take treatment, there is possibility of improvement in the disability. 17.The petitioner – Ramesh himself appeared as PW -6 and he reiterated the stand as taken in the petition by way of tendering his affidavit as Ex.PW6/A. During cross-examination, he deposed that he is having driving licence but the same is missing. He had denied a suggestion that he had consumed alcohol at the time of accident. Volunterred that he had taken medicines for cough. He further deposed that he had taken treatment from Civil Hospital as well as from Government Hospital. He had not brought any proof regarding his income. 18.Photocopy of driving licence of respondent No.1 has been placed on record which is valid for driving transport vehicle from 23.07.2013 to 8 MACT Case No.418 of 2015. Ramesh Versus Bhupender & ors. 22.07.2016 and the offending vehicle bearing registration No.RJ-26-GA-0720 is insured with United India Insurance Company Ltd. From 10.03.2014 to 09.03.2015. 19.From the perusal of copy of FIR No.389 dated 03.12.2014 Ex.PW1/A, it is evident that the driver of truck bearing registration No.RJ- GA-0720, after causing the accident had fled away from the spot, while leaving the truck at the spot. PW -1 HC Ishwar Singh also deposed that FIR No.389 dated 03.12.2014 was registered in Police Station Sadar, Gohana against Bhupender Singh son of Laadu Lal Nayak. Further, it cannot be lost sight of that in the instant petition an enquiry of civil nature is being conducted and as per settled principles of law, for proving a fact in this enquiry, strict rules of the Evidence Act are not applicable. The inferences in the instant case have to be drawn by appreciating the evidence of the parties by applying the rule of preponderance of probabilities. 20.In the case of Harjit Singh and another Vs. Suresh Kumar and other, FAO No.1464 of 2006, decided on 18.12.2008 the Hon'ble High Court of Punjab & Haryana has observed that proceeding before the Tribunal being an enquiry of civil nature does not warrant any strict evidence, for proving a fact. As per Hon'ble High Court if a person has been challaned it is sufficient indicator of the involvement of his vehicle, in the accident. 21.The Hon'ble High Court in the case of Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Shyam and other 1993(2) PLR 109 has observed that if FIR is registered against the driver, it is, prima facie, safe to conclude that the accident had 9 MACT Case No.418 of 2015. Ramesh Versus Bhupender & ors. taken place due to rash and negligent driving of the vehicle by its driver. 22.In the instant case, respondents No.1 & 2 did not appear and opted not to contest the petition. Hence, they were proceeded against ex parte. 23.Therefore, taking into consideration, the above mentioned relevant law and the evidence adduced by the claimant, which is thoroughly consistent, I hold that in the instant petition, the claimant has been successful to prove that the accident in question had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by the respondent No.1. 24.Now let us see as to what amount of compensation, the claimant is entitled to and from whom. In this context, the learned counsel for the claimant has contended that the claimant was working as Munim with M/s Ram Kishan Ram Niwas New Grain Market, Gohana, Shop No.165 and was drawing salary of Rs.20,000/- per month. The claimant has also examined Smt.Neelam wife of Ram Niwas and she tendered into evidence her duly sworn affidavit as Ex.PW2/A and deposed that petitioner was working on their shop as Munim and they used to pay Rs.20,000/- per month to him. 25.In assessing the compensation payable the settled principles need to be borne in mind. A Victim who suffers a permanent or temporary disability occasioned by an accident is entitled to the award of compensation. The award of compensation must cover among others, the following aspects: (I).Pain, suffering and trauma resulting from the accident; (ii).Loss of income including future income; (iii).The inability of the victim to lead a normal life together with its 10 MACT Case No.418 of 2015. Ramesh Versus Bhupender & ors. amenities; (iv).Medical expenses including those that the victim may be required to undertake in future; and (v).loss of expectation of life. 26.The Hon’ble Apex Court in Jagdish Versus Mohan & ors. Civil Appeal No.2217 of 2018 decided on 6.03.2018 has held that while determining the quantum of compensation payable to the victims of accident, who are disabled either permanently or temporarily, if the victim of the accident suffers permanent disability, then efforts should always be made to award adequate compensation not only for the physical injury and treatment, but also for the loss of earning and his inability to lead a normal life and enjoy amenities, which he would have enjoyed but for the disability caused due to the accident. 27.The principle of determination of compensation in the case of permanent/partial disablement has been exhaustively dealt with after referring to the relevant case law on the subject in the case of Raj Kumar verus Ajay Kumar & Ors. 2011 (2) R.C.R. (Civil) 101 , in the following words: ""Assessment of future loss of earnings due to permanent disability” “Disability refers to any restriction or lack of ability to perform an activity in the manner considered normal for a human being. Permanent disability refers to the residuary incapacity or loss of use of some part of the body, found existing at the end of the period of treatment and recuperation, after achieving the 11 MACT Case No.418 of 2015. Ramesh Versus Bhupender & ors. maximum bodily improvement or recovery which is likely to remain for the remainder life of the injured. Temporary disability refers to the incapacity or loss of use of some part of the body on account of the injury, which will cease to exist at the end of the period of treatment and recuperation. Permanent disability can be either partial or total. Partial permanent disability refers to a person's inability to perform all the duties and bodily functions that he could perform before the accident, though he is able to perform some of them and is still able to engage in some gainful activity. Total permanent disability refers to a person's inability to perform any avocation or employment related activities as a result of the accident. The permanent disabilities that may arise from motor accident injuries, are of a much wider range when compared to the physical disabilities which are enumerated in the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 (""the Disabilities Act"", for short). But if any of the disabilities enumerated in Section 2(i) of the Disabilities Act are the result of injuries sustained in a motor accident, they can be permanent disabilities for the purpose of claiming compensation.” 28.The petitioner has examined Dr.Amit Dahiya as PW -5, who deposed that on 06.12.2017 he alongwith Deputy CMO and PMO, Civil Hospital, Sonipat had examined patient Ramesh and found that patient was a post traumatic case with RTA and on X-ray examination, the implant DHS present at right hip and plating at distal femur with knee and ankle stiffness and concluded that patient was physically disabled and has 60 % temporary physical disability, which is likely to be improved with treatment. Disability 12 MACT Case No.418 of 2015. Ramesh Versus Bhupender & ors. certificate Ex.PW5/A shows that petitioner was having history of treatment of post traumatic with DHS at right hip and plating and distal femur with knee and ankle stiffness. The petitioner was having 60% temporary disability qua particular limb and not qua whole body. 29.As discussed above, as stated by PW -2 Smt. Neelam, petitioner was working as Munim and was drawing salary of Rs.20,000/- per month. Petitioner while appearing as PW -6 deposed that he had to remain in the hospital from 03.12.2014 to 19.12.2014 for treatment and during this period operation was conducted in a private hospital and he had spent about Rs.1,50,000/- on his treatment etc. Thus, certainly the petitioner had to remain absent from his job as well for a considerable period. Further, on account of injuries sustained by the claimant in the accident, he had suffered pain and suffering as well, therefore, on this count also he is entitled to compensation. As per PW -3 – Shamsher, he had taken the petitioner about 20 times to PGIMS, Rohtak in his vehicle for OPD and for further treatment and he had charged Rs.3,000/- per visit. Thus, the petitioner had to incur something on transportation etc. Therefore, the claimant is also entitled to compensation under this head as well. Thus, in view of the principle laid down in Amric Singh Versus Chhote Lal & Anr. FAO No.4748 of 2004 decided on 27.3.2017 by our own Hon’ble High Court the compensation of claimant is calculated as under:- 1. Pain and sufferings Rs.50,000/- 2. Loss of amenities due to temporary disability to the Rs.1,20,000/- 13 MACT Case No.418 of 2015. Ramesh Versus Bhupender & ors. extent of 60% 3. The claimant had remained admitted in the hospital from 03.12.2014 to 19.12.2014 and during this period he has to engage any attendant and he must have taken special diet etc. and, thus, it is imperative to grant some money under this head also. Hence, this Tribunal is inclined to grant Rs.20,000/-under this head. Rs.20,000/- 4. Loss of income as the claimant remained admitted for for 16 days and in view of injuries sustained by him, he might have have been unable to do any work for some more time, therefore, this Tribunal is of the view that the claimant is entitled to Rs.20,000/- under this head. Rs.20,000/- 5. The claimant had taken treatment from PGIMS, Rohtak as well as from private hospital but no medical bill has been placed on record and as per petitioner, the bills have been lost. But despite that certainly, he has to incur some money on medicines etc. and for treatment had attended the hospital in some vehicle. Thus, he is entitled to the compensation for transportation as well as medicines.Rs.20,000/- Thus, total amounts comes Rs.2,30,000/- (Rs.two lacs and thirty thousands only) 30. The next question to be determined is as to by whom, the compensation is to be paid? As discussed above, from the perusal of photocopy of driving licence of respondent No.1, which has been placed on record, it is evident that the respondent No.1 was having valid and effective driving licence, which was valid from 23.07.2013 to 22.07.2016 and the offending vehicle bearing registration No.RJ-26-GA-0720 was insured with United India Insurance Company Ltd. from 10.03.2014 to 09.03.2015. 14 MACT Case No.418 of 2015. Ramesh Versus Bhupender & ors. However, it is worth mentioning here that neither the respondent No.1 - driver nor respondent No.2, owner of the offending vehicle, have appeared in the witness box and both the respondents were proceeded against ex parte. The respondents No. 1 & 2 have not produced the permit of the vehicle. Our own Hon’ble High Court in similar circumstances has held in case National insurance Company Ltd. Versus parveen Kumar & Anr. FAO No. 9028 of 2014 (O&M) decided on 27.02.2017 has held:- “An identical question was came up for hearing before the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of National Insurance Company Ltd. vs. Chella Bharathamma; 2004 (4) RCR (Civil) 399; in which it was observed that a person plying the offending vehicle without permit cannot be placed at a better pedestal vis-a-vis one who has a permit, but has violated any condition thereof and in such a situation insurer cannot be made liable for such vehicle. It was also categorically observed by Hon'ble Apex Court in this regard in para 8 of its judgment, which reads as follows: High Court was of the view that since there was no permit, the question of violation of any condition thereof does not arise. The view is clearly fallacious. A person without permit to ply a vehicle cannot be placed at a better pedestal vis-a-vis one who has a permit, but has violated any condition thereof. Plying of a vehicle without a permit is an infraction. Therefore, in terms of Section 149(2) defence is available to the insurer on that aspect. The acceptability of the stand is a matter of adjudication. The question of policy being operative had no relevance for the issue regarding liability of insurer. High Court was, therefore, not justified in holding the insurer liable”. 15 MACT Case No.418 of 2015. Ramesh Versus Bhupender & ors. 31.More so, respondent No.3 insurance company has also not led any evidence. Therefore, it is concluded that insurance company shall firstly pay the amount of compensation. However, respondent No.3- insurance company shall have the right to recover the same from respondents No. 1 & 2. Accordingly, both these issues are decided in favour of petitioner. I SSUE No.3 32.Onus to prove this issue was upon respondent No.3. As discussed above, respondents No. 1 & 2 did not appear to contest the petition and they were proceeded against ex parte. Where, insurance company- respondent No.3 did not lead any evidence. Hence, insurance company shall firstly make the payment of compensation amount. However, respondent No.3- insurance company shall have the right to recover the same from respondents No. 1 & 2, later on. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of respondent No.3. RELIEF :- 33.In view of the findings of this Tribunal returned on issues under adjudication, present claim petition succeeds and same is hereby partly accepted with costs. The petitioner is awarded a compensation to the tune of Rs.2,30,000/- (Rs.two lacs and thirty thousands only) with interest @ 7% per annum from the date of filing of petition till the date of realization. If amount is not paid within two months, then rate of interest will be 9% per annum. It is made clear that the amount of compensation shall be paid in cash in favour of claimant. 16 MACT Case No.418 of 2015. Ramesh Versus Bhupender & ors. 34.Counsels fee is assessed at Rs.2200/-. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly. The Insurance Company - respondent No.3 is directed to deposit the amount directly in the account of claimant. However, respondent No.3- insurance company shall have the right to recover the amount of compensation from respondents No. 1 & 2, later on. File be consigned to the records after due compliance.

Name of respondent No.3 deleted vide order dated 04.09.2015. 5 Smt. Shobha Versus Nitin Kumar & Ors. AWARD: Vide this single award of even date, I shall dispose of four claim petitions, titled above, as the same are arising out of the same accident and all the four claim petitions were consolidated vide order dated 04.09.2015 passed by Shri Sushil Kumar, learned MACT, Sonipat. The petition No.91 of 2015 titled as “Smt.Shobha Versus Nitin Kumar & ors” was treated as main case and further proceedings were ordered tobe recorded in that petition. 2.In brief, the facts of the main claim petition titled as “Smt.Shobha Versus Nitin Kumar & ors” are that the petitioner – Smt.Shobha has filed the claim petition seeking compensation Under Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act on account of injuries sustained by her in a Motor Vehicular accident, which took place on 25.09.2014 at about 6.00p.m. in the area of Police Station Ganaur, due to alleged rash and negligent driving of vehicle bearing registration No.DL-4CNE-1030 (hereinafter referred to as the offending vehicle) by respondent No.1 and the same was owned by respondent No. 2. 3.According to the petitioner - Smt. Shobha on 25.09.2014 Pawan Kumar son of Pyare lal was going to Panipat from Delhi and the claimant was travelling in Van bearing No.CL-9CB-6310 and when the claimant reached near Gannaur Flyover near Gupti Sagar Dham, a Toyota Innova bearing registration No.DL-4CNE-1030 being driven in rash and negligent manner, came from back side and hit the Van of the claimant, while overtaking, due to which Van struck into divider of the road and the claimant sustained grievous 6 Smt. Shobha Versus Nitin Kumar & Ors. injuries. It was pleaded that driver of the offending vehicle came to claimants and after taking advantage of gathering of the people at the spot, fled away from the spot alongwith his vehicle. Pawan Kumar noted down the registration number of the Innova to be as DL-4CNE-1030. The injured was shifted to Bhatia Hospital, Ganaur by Pawan. Statement of Pawan was recorded by the police, on the basis of which, FIR No.372 dated 29.09.2014 under Sections 279 & 337 IPC was registered at Police Station Ganaur against respondent No.1. It was pleaded that the accident in question took place due to sole rash and negligent driving of vehicle bearing registration No.DL- 4CNE-1030 on the part of respondent No.1. 4.It was pleaded that the injured – Shobha was shifted to AIIMS, Delhi and about Rs. One lac was spent on the treatment of the injured. It was pleaded that due to the injuries sustained in the accident, the claimant had to suffer pain, suffering and agony. She had to remain bad ridden as well. With these pleas, a prayer has been made to award compensation to the tune of Rs.six lacs with interest. 5.In claim petition titled as “Chandni Versus Nitin Kumar & ors.” it was pleaded that in the above mentioned accident claimant Chandni also sustained multiple injuries and about Rs.50,000/- was spent on her treatment, special diet etc. A prayer has been made to award Rs.three lacs with interest as compensation on account of injuries sustained by Smt.Chandni in the accident, which was occurred on 25.09.2014 on account of rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent No.1. 6.In claim petition titled as “Dolly Versus Nitin Kumar & ors.” it 7 Smt. Shobha Versus Nitin Kumar & Ors. was pleaded that claimant - Chandni had also sustained multiple injuries and about Rs.one lac was spent on her treatment, special diet etc. A prayer has been made to award Rs.five lacs with interest as compensation on account of injuries sustained by minor Dolly in the accident, which occurred on 25.09.2014 on account of rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent No.1. 7.Similarly, in claim petition titled as “Mantun Chaudhary Versus Nitin Kumar & ors.” it was pleaded that claimant Mantun Chaudhary had sustained multiple injuries in the accident, which took place on 25.09.2014 on account of rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent No.1, while driving vehicle bearing registration No.DL-4CNE-1030 and about Rs.one lac was spent on his treatment, special diet etc. The claimant Mantun Chaudhary was a rickshaw puller and was earning about Rs.12,000/- per month and on account of injuries sustained in the accident he has to remain bed ridden and suffered loss on account of his earnings etc. After the accident, the claimant Mantun Chaudhary is unable to pull the rickshaw. Therefore, it has been prayed that an award of Rs.ten lacs with interest may be passed. 8.Upon notice, respondent No. 1 appeared and filed written statement taking preliminary objections about maintainability, locus-standi and cause of action etc. On merits, it was pleaded that so far as FIR is concerned, the same is a matter of record but the respondent No.1 has been falsely implicated in the above noted FIR by the petitioner in collusion with local police as the accident had not taken place with the vehicle of answering respondent, 8 Smt. Shobha Versus Nitin Kumar & Ors. therefore, the vehicle of respondent No.1 is not the offending vehicle. It was pleaded that the amount claimed by the claimants, in their separate claim petitions, is on higher side and the same is without any basis. The answering respondent is not liable to pay the compensation amount. The claimants might be hit by some other vehicle who fled away form the spot. It was pleaded that just to grab the amount of compensation, the petitioners have got registered false FIR against respondent No.1. Refuting the other averments of the petitions, a prayer has been made to dismiss the claim petitions. 9.Respondent No.2 also contested the claim petition by way of filing separate written statement, in which, preliminary objections about maintainability, cause of action and locus-standi were taken. 10.On merits, it was pleaded that the FIR is a matter of record. The respondent No.2 has been falsely implicated in the case just to grab the compensation amount. The accident was not taken place on account of the vehicle of respondent No.2. The amount of compensation is on higher side, excessive and exorbitant and without any basis. The answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. The accident was not caused by the vehicle of respondent No.2 and false FIR has been got registered by the claimants just to grab the compensation. The entire story of accident has been concocted by the claimants. It was pleaded that there is no concern with respondent No.1 because respondent No.1 was not the driver in the month of September, 2014 on the vehicle bearing registration No.DL-4CNE-1030. Controverting the other averments of the petition a prayer has been made to dismiss the claim petitions. 9 Smt. Shobha Versus Nitin Kumar & Ors. 11.From the pleadings of the parties following issues were framed on 04.09.2015:- 1.Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle bearing registration No.DL-4CNE-1030 by its driver-respondent No.1 on 25.09.2014 within the jurisdiction of police station Ganaur causing injuries to injured Shobha, Mantun Chaudhary, Chandi and Dolly, as alleged?OPP 2.If issue No. 1 is proved in affirmative to what amount of compensation, the petitioners are entitled to and from whom?OPP 3.Whether the claim petitions are not maintainable and the petitioners have no cause of action and locus-standi to file the present claim petition?OPR 4.Whether respondent No.1 was not holding valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident if so its effect?

Copy of judgment dated 16.03.2015, vide which, respondent No.1 Nitin Kumar has confessed his guilt for the commission of offences punishable under Sections 279,337, & 338 of IPC as Ex.R-8 and order on the quantum of sentence, vide which, the respondent No.1 was sentenced to pay fine, as Ex.R-9. 14.I have heard the arguments on behalf of both sides and have gone through the file and evidence on record. My issue-wise findings with reasons are as under - Issues No.1 & 2: 15.Both these issues are inter-connected, hence, the same are taken up together for discussion. Onus to prove these issues was upon the petitioners. In order to prove these issues, claimant – Smt.Shobha herself appeared as PW-1 and re-iterated the stand as taken in the petition by way of tendering her duly sworn affidavit as Ex.RW-1. During cross-examination, she deposed that the offending vehicle hit on backside of their vehicle. She deposed that on her treatment, she had spent about Rs.1,50,000/- but she has no bill in this regard (underlining by me) 16.Petitioner – Mantun Chaudhary also reiterated the stand as taken 11 Smt. Shobha Versus Nitin Kumar & Ors. in the petition by way of tendering his affidavit as Ex.PW2/A. During cross- examination, he deposed that the offending vehicle hit on back side of their vehicle. He deposed that on his treatment, he had spent about Rs.30,000/- to Rs.40,000/- 17.PW-3 Mozammil Pheroz, Senior Resident, Department of Orthopedic CIO, Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi deposed that he had treated the patient Doly and tendered document Ex.PW3/A. During cross- examination, he deposed that he had not brought the original register. PW – 4 Alok Kumar Divedi, Assistant Medical Record Officer,medical Record Department, GRB Hospital, Dilsad Garden, Delhi deposed that patients Chandni, Doly, Mantu and Saroj @ Shobha came in emergency in their hospital and after treatment, they left the hospital on the same day. There is no OPD record available in their hospital . Dr.D.P.Bhatia, Bhatia Hospital, GT Road, Ganaur deposed that he has examined Smt.Sobha, Chandni, Dolly and Montu and given first aid to them and thereafter, the injured were referred to higher centre for follow up the treatment. He deposed that as per receipt No.4244 he had received a sum of Rs.5500/- for treatment of Dolly and Chandni and the MLC of the injured have been proved as Ex.P1 to Ex.P-4 (underlining by me). 18.On the other hand, respondent No.2- owner of the vehicle bearing registration No.DL-4CNE-1030 appeared as RW-1 and tendered into evidence his duly sworn affidavit as Ex.RW1/A. During cross-examination, he deposed that he is owner of the vehicle bearing registration No.DL-4CNE- 1030. He further admitted that respondent No.1 – Nitin had pleaded guilty in 12 Smt. Shobha Versus Nitin Kumar & Ors. the state case and he was sentenced in that criminal case. 19.Respondent No.1 Nitin Kumar himself appeared in the witness box as RW-2 and reiterated the facts as mentioned in the petition by way of tendering his duly sworn affidavit as Ex.PW-2/A. During cross-examination, he admitted that he had pleaded guilty before the Court of learned JMIC, Ganaur and he was sentenced to pay a fine of Rs.2000/- for the commission of the accident. 20.The learned counsel for the petitioners contended that on 25.09.2014 the claimants were travelling in a Van bearing registration No.DL- 0CB-6310 being driven by Pawan Kumar and when the claimants reached near Gupti Sagar Dham, a vehicle make Toyota Innova bearing registration No.DL-4CVE-1030 being driven in rash and negligent manner came and hit and overtake the Van due to which, Van Struck into the divider of the road and all the claimants sustained injuries. The learned counsel submitted that the claimants had taken treatment from the hospital at Ganaur as well as from Delhi and they had spent Lacs of rupees on their treatment. The learned counsel further argued that FIR No.372 dated 29.09.2014 under Sections 279 & 337 IPC was registered against respondent No.1 at Police Station Ganaur. The learned counsel further argued that respondent No.1 had confessed his guilt. Therefore, the claimants be awarded compensation as claimed by them. 21.On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent No.1 submitted that respondent No.1 was falsely involved in the accident and to get the compensation, the complainant has lodged false FIR just to get compensation. The learned counsel argued that the claim petition deserves 13 Smt. Shobha Versus Nitin Kumar & Ors. dismissal. 22.Learned counsel for respondent No. 2 – owner of the offending vehicle argued that though, the respondent No.1 has confessed his guilt but at the time of accident, he was not driver on the vehicle of respondent No.2. Therefore, the respondent No.2, being owner is not liable to pay compensation and if any compensation is awarded, then respondent No.1 is liable to pay the same. 23.After hearing the learned counsel for the parties and taking into account the documentary evidence, this Tribunal is of the view that all the four claim petitions, titled above, deserve to be partly allowed for the reasons mentioned hereinafter. If we take a look on the FIR No.372 dated 29.09.2014 registered under Sections 279 & 337 IPC at Police Station Ganaur, it transpires that the same was lodged by Pawan Kumar, who stated that on 25.09.2014 he was going from Delhi to Panipat in his relation while driving his Van bearing registration No.DL-9CB-6310. In the Van, his cousin – Mantu, his wife Shanti Devi, his girls Doli and Chandni were also travelling and when the Van reached near Gupti Sagar Dham, an Innova bearing registration No.DL-4CNE-1030 came being driven in rash and negligent manner and hit the Van. It was further stated in the FIR (Ex.P-20) that the accident took place due to sole rash and negligent driving of the driver of Innova vehicle. 24.The factum of taking cognizance by the police is very material and relevant factor for drawing a conclusion as to whether the onus to prove rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 has been discharged by the 14 Smt. Shobha Versus Nitin Kumar & Ors. claimants or not? In this context, this fact cannot be ignored that in the instant petition an enquiry of civil nature is being conducted and as per settled principles of law, for proving a fact in this enquiry, strict rules of the Evidence Act are not applicable. The inferences in the instant case have to be drawn by appreciating the evidence of the parties by applying the rule of preponderance of probabilities. The FIR has been registered on 25.09.2014 against respondent No.1 for the commission of offences punishable under Sections 279 & 337 IPC. Report under Sections 173 Cr.P.C. was submitted in the Court and charges against respondent No.1 framed on 16.03.2015 (Ex.R-6) for the commission of offences punishable under Sections 279,337 & 338 IPC, to which, the accused pleaded guilty. His confessional statement in this regard (Ex.R-5) was also recorded. Thereafter, considering the confessional statement made by the respondent No.1- Nitin Kumar, he was sentenced to pay fine for the commission of offences punishable under Sections 279,337 & 338 IPC and the fine was accordingly paid respondent No.1. 25.I also place my reliance upon the case of Harjit Singh and another Vs. Suresh Kumar and other, FAO No.1464 of 2006, decided on 18.12.2008 the Hon'ble High Court of Punjab & Haryana has observed that proceeding before the Tribunal being an enquiry of civil nature does not warrant any strict evidence, for proving a fact. As per Hon'ble High Court if a person has been challaned it is sufficient indicator of the involvement of his vehicle, in the accident. 26.The Hon'ble High Court in the case of Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Shyam and other 1993(2) PLR 109 has observed that if FIR is registered 15 Smt. Shobha Versus Nitin Kumar & Ors. against the driver, it is, prima facie, safe to conclude that the accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of the vehicle by its driver. 27.As discussed above, t aking into consideration, the evidence adduced by the claimants as well as by the respondents No. 1 & 2, which is thoroughly consistent, I hold that in the instant petition, the claimants have been successfully proved that the accident in question had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by the respondent No.1. 28.Now let us see as to what amount of compensation, the petitioners are entitled to and from whom. Compensation in claim petition No.91 of 2015 titled as “Shobha Versus Nitin” : 29.In this context, it is to be noted down that during cross- examination, injured Shobha though, pleaded that on her treatment she had incurred about Rs.1,50,000/- but she deposed that she did not tender any bill about the medicines etc. It cannot be lost sight of that initially, Shobha got herself admitted in Bhatia Memorial Nursing Home, Ganaur, where her MLC Ex.P-2 was prepared and from there she was referred to other hospital authorities for treatment. A perusal of MLC Ex.P-2 shows that claimant Shobha suffered multiple abrasions. There was no grievous injury on her body. The follow up of OPD card shows that she had gone to the hospital for dressing. There are no bills of medicines purchased. Only receipt Ex.P-3 for hiring Ambulance has been produced. A person who suffered simple injuries does not require ambulance. In the entire facts and circumstances, I propose to give this claimant – Shobha a sum of Rs.10,000/- in lump sum on account of pain and suffering and for medicines as she had suffered multiple 16 Smt. Shobha Versus Nitin Kumar & Ors. abrasions. Compensation in claim petition No.92 of 2015 titled as “Chandni Versus Nitin” : AND Compensation in claim petition No.93 of 2015 titled as “Dolly Versus Nitin” : 30.So far as compensation with respect to injured Dolly and Chandni, is concerned, it has come on record that both the injured Dolly and Chandni were admitted in Bhatia memorial Nursing Home, Ganaur and the Doctor has charged Rs.5500/- for the treatment of injured Chandni and Dolly vide Ex.PW5/A. MLC (Ex.P-1) for the injuries of Chandni was also prepared at Bhatia Hospital, Ganaur. PW – 5 Dr.D.P.Bhatia, Bhatia Hospital, Ganaur while stepping into the witness box deposed that as per receipt No.4244, he had received a sum of Rs.5500 for the treatment of injured Dolly and Chandni. The claimant Chandni suffered multiple abrasions and lacerated wound on left elbow and forearm. No medical bills have been placed on record. Only receipt of Rs.5500/- (Ex.PW5/A) issued by Bhatia Memorial General & Maternity Hospital, has been produced on account of giving first aid and emergency and for MLC fee by Bhatia Hospital, Ganaur. Since the claimant – Chandni had only suffered simple injuries, hence, she is awarded compensation of Rs.10,000/- (Rs. Ten Thousands only) in lump sum on account of pain and suffering and for purchase of medicines. 31.So far as claim of claimant – Dolly is concerned, no cogent evidence has been led by the claimant except OPD card Ex.P-18. Patient Dolly is a child of 10 years. OPD Card – Ex.P-18 shows that she was treated for Mal United Fracture. MPX left ring finger. The OPD Card shows that she 17 Smt. Shobha Versus Nitin Kumar & Ors. had visited the hospital on 9.12.2014 to 16.1.2015 on different dates. No medical bills have been placed on record by claimant – Dolly. Hence, under these circumstances, I propose to award a sum of Rs.20,000/- (Rs.twenty thousands only) to claimant – Dolly on account of pain and suffering and for purchase of medicines. Compensation in claim petition No.94 of 2015 titled as “Mantun Chaudhary Versus Nitin” : 32.At the very outset, it is evident from Ex.P-4, receipt issued by Bhatia Memorial Hospital, Ganaur, that Mantun Chaudhary was firstly taken to Bhatia Hospital, Ganaur and after first aid, he was referred to Delhi. MLC for the injuries of Mantun Chaudhary Ex.P-3 was also prepared. A perusal of MLC Ex.P-3 reveals that claimant Mantun sustained multiple abrasions of his right shoulder, right elbow and right forearm and X-ray was advised. From Ex.P-6, Blood Requisition form, it is revealed that there was Intra op. Blood loss and by way of blood requisition form, transfusion of blood was given to the claimant – Mantun Chaudhary, which was released vide Ex.P-7. Ex.P-9 shows that a sum of Rs.8400/- was incurred by the claimant on account of purchase of locking plate proximal etc. Ex.P-10 is the receipt regarding depositing of Rs.2,000/- towards emergency, first aid and MLC fees. Ex.P-12 is cash memo regarding purchase of medicines for Rs.2818/-. Treatment record Ex.P-12 goes to show that claimant Mantun Chaudhary had suffered grievous injuries by way of fracture but the concerned Doctor, who gave treatment to this claimant has not been examined. Therefore, this Tribunal is inclined to awarded Rs.35,000/- (Rs. Thirty five thousands only) in lump sum 18 Smt. Shobha Versus Nitin Kumar & Ors. as compensation on account of medicines, special diet, transportation, pain and suffering etc. to injured Mantun Chaudhary. 33.It is worth while to mention here that since the petitioners or the respondents No.1 & 2 had failed to produce any insurance policy, it is presumed that the offending vehicle was not insured with respondent No.3- insurance company, hence, vide order dated 04.09.2015 passed by Shri Sushil Kumar, learned MACT, Sonipat, name of respondent No.3 – insurance company was deleted. However, it is not disputed that respondent No.1 – Nitin was driving the offending vehicle bearing registration No.DL-4CNE- 1030 on 25.09.2014, i.e. at the time of the accident and respondent No.2 – Rajiv Luthra was registered owner. Hence, it is concluded that both the respondents No.1 & 2, jointly and severally, are liable to pay the compensation amount. Hence, a ccordingly, both the issues No. 1 & 2, in all the four claim petitions, are decided in favour of petitioners. Issues No.3 34.The onus to prove this issue was upon the respondents. However, in view of my findings given on issues No. 1 & 2, it is held that this petition is well maintainable. Hence, this issue is decided against the respondents. Issue No.4 & 5. 35.The onus to prove both these issues was upon respondent No.3 – insurance company. However, as discussed above, the name of respondent No.3 has been deleted. Therefore, both these issues have become redundant. Hence, disposed off accordingly. 19 Smt. Shobha Versus Nitin Kumar & Ors. RELIEF : 36.In view of the findings of this Tribunal returned on the issues under adjudication, all the four claim petitions, titled above, succeed and same are hereby partly accepted with costs. The petitioner in claim petition No.91 of 2015 titled as “ Shobha Versus Nitin & ors ”, is awarded compensation to the tune of Rs.10,000/- (Rs.ten thousands only). Similarly, in claim petition No.92 & No.93 of 2015 titled as “ Chandni Versus Nitin & ors”, the claimant Chandni is awarded Rs.10,000/- (Rs.Ten Thousands) as compensation in lump sum, whereas, claimant Dolly in claim petition titled as “Dolly Versus Nitin & ors ” is awarded compensation to the tune of Rs.20,000/- (Rs.twenty thousands only).

Sh.P.K.Bhagat, Advocate for respondent No.3. AWARD: The present petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) has been filed by the petitioners claiming compensation on account of death of Rajender son of Vishnu in a Motor Vehicular accident which took place on 7.12.2014 at about 3.20 p.m. in the area of police station, Rai, due to alleged rash and negligent driving of Motorcycle Bajaj Discover bearing No. HR-10V-2453 by respondent No.1. Petitioners have sought compensation to the tune of Rs.20 lacs. 2. The brief facts of the claimants ’ case are that on 7.12.2014 Rajender (since deceased) had gone to Baghpat for his personal work on his motorcycle bearing No. HR-10U-5250 and when he was coming from 3 Baghpat to his native village on his motorcycle at about 3.20 p.m. and when he reached ahead of village Garh Mirakpur and turned towards Palra mor, in the meantime, driver of the offending motorcycle bearing regd. No. HR-10V-2453 came from village Palra side and struck against the motorcycle of the petitioner. That there were two young boys on the motorcycle and the driver of the motorcycle Bearing No. HR-10V-2453 was driving his motorcycle in a very rash and negligent manner and at a very high speed and because of the impact of the accident, the riders of both the motorcycles fell down on the road in opposite directions and they were brought to the hospital for treatment by their family members. That Rajender (since deceased) suffered serious injuries in the said accident and he was shifted to Trauma Centre, Delhi and the doctors of Trauma Centre, Delhi sent an information to the police immediately after admission of Rajender in Trauma Centre on 8.12.2014 and one ASI of P.S. Rai then visited Trauma Centre and after taking opinion of the doctor about condition of injured Rajender recorded his statement and on the basis of his medical record, FIR No. 364 dated 10.12.2014 under section 279/337/338 IPC was registered at P.S. Rai, Sonepat. That the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. It is 4 further averred that Rajender suffered various fractures on his body and doctors implanted surgical rod in his body and he remained admitted in the hospital upto 20.12.2014 and thereafter he took treatment as outdoor patient from Lok Nayak hospital, New Delhi, but his condition became worst and due to injuries he developed infections in the body and ultimately he succumbed to the injuries on 3.1.2015 and his body was cremated without giving any information to the police and the police contacted the family of deceased Rajender on 5.1.2015 and took the statement of Monu, i.e. brother of Rajender, who told the police that Rajender died because of injuries suffered by him in the accident and the police did not take any action and produced the report u/s 173 Cr.P.C without adding section 304-A IPC. It is further averred that deceased/Rajender was 37 years of age and was working as helper in Hilton factory, village Dhaturi and was earning Rs.10,000/- per month. 3. Notice of the petition was given to the respondents and respondents No.1 and 2 filed joint reply pleading that a false case has been got registered against respondent No.1 in collusion with the local police with ulterior motive to extract money from the answering respondents as respondent No.1 was driving his motorcycle at a normal 5 speed on correct side of the road and by observing all the traffic rules and it was the deceased who was rash, negligent and careless in driving his motorcycle No.HR-10U-5250. Denying all the other material averments, respondents No. 1 & 2 have prayed for dismissal of the claim petition. 4. Respondent No.3, vide its reply, has taken preliminary objections regarding maintainability, cause of action, want of driving licence of the driver of the vehicle, violation of the terms & conditions of the insurance policy etc. On merits, it is stated that the respondent No. 1 was not having valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident and the vehicle was being driven in violation of the provisions of M.V. Act and against the terms of the policy and consequently the respondent no.3 Insurance Company is not liable to pay compensation, if any, to the claimants. Further pleaded that no accident took place with motorcycle bearing No. HR-10V-2453. Denying all other material averments, respondent no. 3 has prayed for dismissal of the claimants ’ petition. 5. No replication had been filed and on the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed for adjudication vide order dated 6.7.2015:- 6 1. Whether the death of Rajender son of Vishnu alias Vishnu Dutt is the result of accident which took place on 7.12.2014 due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle/ motorcycle regd. bearing No. HR-10V-2453 by its driver i.e. respondent No. 1? OPP 2 If issue no.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation the petitioners are entitled to and from whom? OPP 3. Whether respondent No.1 was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident and the offending vehicle had violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect? OPR-3 4. Relief 6. In support of their respective averments, the parties adduced their respective evidence. One of the claimants, namely, Santosh widow of deceased Rajender appeared as PW1 and claimants further examined Dr. Nidhi Sharma, Medical Officer, General Hospital, Sonepat as PW2, Surender, Criminal Ahlmad as PW3 and Dr.Sumit Gupta from Trauma Centre Delhi as PW4 and also placed on record Ex.P1 copy of MLR of deceased Rajender, Ex.P2 copy of FIR, Ex.P3 copy of report u/s 173 Cr.P.C., Ex.P5 copy of death certificate of Rajender, Ex.P6 Discharge 7 Summary, Ex.P7 to Ex.P14 receipts, Ex.P15 and Ex.P16 Photographs and closed the evidence on behalf of petitioner. 7. On the other hand, respondents have led no oral evidence, but tendered into evidence Ex. R1 copy of Cover Note, Ex.R2 Driving Licence Verification report, Ex.R3 RC Verification Report, Ex.R4 copy of Insurance Policy, Ex.R5 copy of Driving Licence, Ex.R6 copy of Registration Certificate and the evidence on behalf of said respondents was closed. 8.I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have also perused the case file carefully and minutely and issue-wise findings with reasons thereof are as under: ISSUE NO.1 9. In order to prove that the respondent No.1 i.e. driver of the offending vehicle motorcycle bearing No.HR-10V-2453 was driving the same in a rash and negligent manner, one of the petitioners namely, Smt.Santosh appeared as PW1 and deposed by way of tendering her affidavit Ex.PW1/A, thereby reiterating the averments made in the claim petition. The statement of PW1 finds corroboration vide Ex.P2 copy of FIR & Ex.P3 copy of report u/s 173 Cr.P.C . Further, PW3/Surender, 8 Criminal Ahlmad, had brought the summoned record of case file titled as ‘State Versus Lokesh son of Net Ram, resident of Palra, District Sonepat ’ in FIR No.364 of 2014 u/ss 279/337/338 IPC, P.S. Rai and stated that charge in this case was framed against accused on 11.2.2015 and now the case has been fixed for prosecution evidence for 10.12.2015 and copy of FIR Ex.P2 and copy of challan Ex.P3 is correct as per record brought by him. Further PW2/Dr. Nidhi Sharma proved the copy of MLR dated 7.12.2014 as Ex.P1. 10. To rebut the claim of the petitioners qua negligence of respondent no.1 in causing the accident in question, respondents have failed to lead any evidence. 11. It is settled law that it is the entire responsibility of the claimants to establish that the driver of the offending vehicle was driving the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner, which resulted into the accident. Further, with regard to standard of proof, it has been held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Parmeshwari Devi vs. Amir Chand and others, 2011(2) RCR (Civil)153, that in a claim pertaining to a road accident, the strict principles of proof in a criminal case are not attracted and that the claimants are merely to establish their case on the touch- 9 stone of preponderance of probabilities. With the above discussed law and evidence on record, this Tribunal is satisfied that the claimants have succeeded in establishing that on 7.12.2014 the offending vehicle was being driven by respondent No.1 in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident in question. PW1/Santosh, vide her affidavit Ex,PW1/A, has reiterated the averments made in the claim petition. The statement of PW1 finds corroboration vide deposition of PW3/Surender, Criminal Ahlmad, who had brought the summoned record of case file ti - tled as ‘State Versus Lokesh son of Net Ram, resident of Palra, District Sonepat’ in FIR No.364 of 2014 u/ss 279/337/338 IPC, P.S. Rai and stated that charge in this case was framed against accused on 11.2.2015 and now the case has been fixed for prosecution evidence for 10.12.2015 and copy of FIR Ex.P2 and copy of challan Ex.P3 are correct as per record brought by him. It is pertinent to mention here that the FIR bearing no. 364/2014 was lodged on the statement of injured Rajender who unfor - tunately expired later on due to the injuries sustained in the accident in question. A perusal of the FIR/Ex.P2 would reveal that the registration number of the offending vehicle has been specifically mentioned in the FIR and it is further alleged that the accident in question has been caused 10 due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle. Moreover the investigating agency investigated the matter and filed final report under section 173 Cr.P.C. against the driver/respondent no.1 vide Ex.P3. Still further, had the accident not been caused by respondent no.1 while driving the offending vehicle rashly and negligently, then there would have been no reason on the part of injured Rajender (since deceased) to lodge the FIR. Further, PW2/Dr.Nidhi has proved MLR/Ex.P1 and also stated that on 7.12.2014 she medico-legally examined Rajender at GH Sonepat. Further, Ex.P1 copy of MLR also makes out that deceased Rajender had received injuries in a road side accident on 7.12.2014. The deposition of PW1 coupled with the documents Ex.P2 copy of FIR & Ex.P3 copy of report u/s 173 Cr.P.C ., duly establish that the accident took place on account of rash and negligent driving of respondent No. 1. Though respondents no.1 & 2 have taken specific plea in the reply that the accident took place due to negligence of the deceased himself, how - ever they have failed to lead any evidence to that effect and to rebut the testimony of the claimants. H ad the accident not taken place as alleged by the petitioners, respondents No.1 & 2 would certainly have made complaints to the higher authorities regarding false implication of their 11 vehicle with regard to the accident, but no such event happened. As per Ex.P3/certified copy of final report under section 173 Cr.P.C., respondent no. 1 was challaned for causing the accident in question by rash and negligent driving, therefore, it is safe to conclude that the accident was result of sole rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No. 1. Reliance in this regard may be placed upon Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Shyam and others, 1993 (2) PLR 109 (P&H) & Gurdeep Kaur Vs. Tarsem Singh , 2008 (2) RCR (Civil) 774. Therefore, the evidence coming on record proves rash and negligent driving of respondent No. 1 in causing the accident in question. This Tribunal does not see any reason to disbelieve the evidence produced by the petitioners. In such circumstances, it is held that petitioners have proved that the accident in question had been caused due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No. 1, on the touch stone of preponderance of probabilities. This issue is accordingly decided in favour of petitioners and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.2 12. So far as the question of quantum of compensation is concerned, PW1/Smt. Santosh has stated that Rajender (since deceased) 12 suffered serious injuries in the accident and he was shifted to Trauma Centre, Delhi. Further stated that injured Rajender suffered various fractures on his body and doctors implanted surgical rod in his body and he remained admitted in the hospital upto 20.12.2014 and thereafter he took treatment as outdoor patient from Lok Nayak hospital, New Delhi, but his condition became worst and due to injuries he developed infections in the body and ultimately he succumbed to the injuries on 3.1.2015 and his body was cremated without giving any information to the police. Further stated that deceased Rajender was about 37 years of age and he had been working as helper in Hilton Factory, Dhaturi and used to draw salary of Rs.10,000/- per month. H owever during her cross- examination, she has admitted she had not brought any proof regarding employment and earning of her husband. 13. At this stage, learned counsel for respondent No. 3- insurance company has argued that the accident in question took place on 7.12.2014 and the deceased Rajender expired on 3.1.2015 and since no PMR of the deceased has come on record, so death of deceased Rajender cannot be stated to be result of accident in question and accordingly the claimants are not entitled to get any compensation. On the other hand, learned counsel for 13 petitioners has vehemently contended that the testimony of treating doctors would clearly establish that death of deceased Rajender was a result of injuries sustained by him in the accident in question. Learned counsel for claimants has referred to the testimony of PW2/Dr. Nidhi Sharma and PW4/Dr. Sumit Gupta in support of his contentions. PW2/ Dr. Nidhi Gupta has proved MLR/Ex.P1 of the injured/deceased. Further, PW4/ Dr. Sumit Gupta, Asstt. Professor, Maulana Azad Medical College and Sushruta Trauma Centra, Delhi deposed that patient Rajender son of Sh. Vishnu was admitted in their hospital on 7.12.2014 due to traffic accident and he was referred from Civil Hospital Sonepat vide MLC No. NS/25/14 and was discharged from our hospital on 20.12.2014. Further deposed that the patient was having serious multiple fractures may be between 5 to 10 with suspected head injury and two major surgeries of the patient were conducted. Further deposed that due to the serious injuries, patient may succumb at the time of trauma. Further deposed that although he was investigated thoroughly i.e. C.T. Scan of head, ultra sound abdomen and multiple x-rays, but some injury may be missed which can create problem later on and are usually picked in regular follow up and the same may be the reason of death and the same can be confirmed from the post mortem 14 report. Keeping in view the afore-stated testimonies of treating doctors, this court finds no force in the arguments raised by learned counsel for respondent No.3. It is suffice to observe that soon after the accident, injured was taken to Civil Hospital, Sonepat where from he was taken to Sushruta Trauma Centre, Delhi. PW-4/Dr. Sumit Gupta has duly deposed that some injury may be missed which can create problem later on and are usually picked in regular follow up and the same may be the reason of death . Though no post-mortem report of the deceased has come on record as no such post-mortem was got conducted by the petitioners due to ignorance, yet the same cannot be taken to be ground to come to a conclusion that there was no connection between the accident and the consequential death of the deceased. Rather the evidence coming on record fairly establish that the deceased had received several injuries in the accident on 7.12.2014 and injured Rajender received treatment at Sushruta Trauma Centre, Delhi from 7.12.2014 to 20.12.2014 and thus it would be too much to read in the arguments on behalf of the insurance company that the death of deceased could have been on account of cause other than the injuries sustained in the accident. Moreover it is trite to say that cause of accident can well be attributed to vehicular accident even if post-mortem was not done on the deceased. Thus, from the afore-discussed evidence on record, it is clearly 15 established that there is a clear and direct nexus between the injuries sustained by the injured Rajender in motor vehicular accident and his consequential death. 14. As has been discussed, claimants have failed to produce on record any proof regarding the income of the deceased. Therefore, in the ab - sence of any evidence regarding income of deceased, this tribunal is duty bound to assess the income of the deceased on notional basis and the princi - ple that is to be applied is that the amount of compensation should be just and fair. Keeping in view the fact that even an unskilled labourer did not earn less than Rs.6,000/- per month at the relevant time, the monthly income of the deceased is taken as Rs. 6,000/- per month. Further, since the depen - dents of the deceased are five in number and as per law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sarla Verma and Others Versus Delhi Transport Corporation and Another, 2009 ACJ 1298, deceased might have spent 1/4th amount upon himself and the remaining 3/4th upon his family/dependents. Thus, the annual dependency upon the deceased comes out to be Rs. 54,000/- (Rs. 6,000/- x 3/4 x 12). Further petitioners have claimed that deceased Rajender was 37 years of age at the relevant time. There is no evidence to the contrary on the part of the respondents. So, in view of the law laid down in Sarla Verma's (supra) case multiplier of 15 16 is to be applied in this regard for arriving at just compensation to be awarded to the petitioners on account of their dependency upon the de - ceased. So the amount of compensation comes out to be Rs. 8,10,000/- (Rs. 54,000/- x 15). Further, there is no evidence to the contrary, so claimants are also held entitled to compensation of Rs.25,000/- on account of ex - penses incurred on funeral and transportation and compensation of Rs.One lac on account of loss of consortium as per the law laid down in Rajesh and Others Vs. Rajbir Singh and Others, 2013(3) RCR (civil) 170. Further a compensation of Rs.1,00,000/- each on account of loss of love & affection for the two minor children is also awarded on account of loss of their father in view of the law laid down in Juju Ku - ruvila & Others vs. Kunjujamma Mohan & Others, (2013)9 SCC 166. Thus, by way of conclusion, the total amount of compensation comes out to be Rs.11,35,000/-. 15. Further, petitioners have also placed on record medical bills Ex.P7, P10 to P12 regarding the treatment expenses incurred on treatment of deceased prior to his demise. The above-stated bills pertain to period during which injured remained admitted in Sushruta Trauma Centre and thus then same seem to be genuine. Thus petitioners incurred 17 approximately an amount of Rs.10,900/-. Accordingly, it is held that claimants are also entitled to receive an amount of Rs.10,900/- on account of medical expenses, besides amount of compensation of Rs. 11,35,000/- on account of loss of dependency. So, by way of conclusion made, the amount of compensation comes to be Rs. 11,45,900/-. 16. Now the next question to be determined under issue no.2 is as to by whom the said amount of compensation is payable. While deciding issue No.1, it has been held that accident in question was caused due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1, driver of the offending vehicle. Admittedly, respondent No.1 was the driver and respondent No.2 being the regd. owner of the vehicle, cannot escape their liability to pay the compensation to the claimants and accordingly, respondents No.1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation. Further, as per Ex.R4/copy of Insurance policy, the offending vehicle bearing no. HR -10V-2453 was duly insured with respondent no.3 Insurance Company for the period from 7.12.2014 to 6.12.2015 and the accident in question took place on 7.12.2014, meaning thereby that the vehicle in question was duly insured with the respondent No.3 at the time of accident. Therefore, respondent No.3 also cannot 18 escape from its liability to pay the awarded compensation. Accordingly, it is held that respondents No.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the awarded amount of compensation and hence this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners and against the respondents. Issue No.3 17.The onus to prove this issue lies upon respondent No.3. A perusal of Driving licence Ex.R5 of respondent No.1 reveals that he was competent to drive the offending vehicle and that driving licence is valid upto 3.12.2015 whereas the accident in question took place on 7.12.2014. Respondent No.3-Insurance company has failed to lead any evidence rebutting the genuineness of the driving licence/Ex.R5. Moreover respondent no.3 has also failed to adduce any evidence regarding violation of any of the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. Therefore, respondent No.3 failed to discharge the onus upon it to the effect that respondent No.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence on the date of accident or that the insured had violated any term of the policy. Consequently, this issue is decided against respondent No.3- Insurance Company. 19 RELIEF 18.As a result of findings returned under issue No.1 to 3, the claim petition filed by the petitioners is partly allowed and a compensation in the sum of Rs.11,45,900/- (Rs.Eleven lacs forty five thousand and nine hundred only) is awarded to the claimants on account of death of Rajender.

Sehgal, Advocate for the petitioners Respondent No.1 already exparte vide order dated 11.3.2015. Shri Vijay Kumar, Advocate for respondent No.2. Sh.Joginder Kuhar, Advolcate for respondent No.3. AWARD : This Award shall dispose of both claim petitions titled above, as both petitions have arisen out of the same accident and were consolidated vide order dated 05.01.2016 in main petition No.76 of 2015-16 titled as “Mukesh & others Vs. Madan and others .” 2.The claimants of main petition titled as Mukesh & others Vs. Madan and others, filed the claim petition on account of death of their son/brother Manish in a motor vehicular accident claiming compensation to the tune of Rs.60.00 lacs. The claim petition titled as Pooja & others Vs. Madan and others has been filed by the petitioners for compensation to the tune of Rs.60 lacs on account of death of their husband/father/son/brother Parveen in the accident in question. 3. While providing the particulars as required under the Motor Vehicles Act and the Rules framed thereunder, claimants inter alia alleged that on 6.12.2014, deceased Manish alongwith his father Jaipal, deceased Parveen son of Anand Parkash and father of deceased Parveen namely Anand Parkash were going from Murthal to village Ahmedpur, District Sonepat in offending vehicle Maruti Van No.DL-3C-AG-4412 in a Barat. Deceased Parveen was sitting with respondent No.1. Respondent No.1 was driving the offending vehicle at a high speed, rashly and negligently in a zig zag manner. Complainant/claimant Jai Pal asked respondent No.1 to drive vehicle at a moderate speed and carefully but respondent No.1 did not pay any heed. At about 10.15 PM when they reached in the area of near Gulia Petrol Pump, Delhi Road, Sonepat, respondent No.1 lost his control over vehicle and struck the same against the divider of the road and also damaged the pole. In the accident, Parveen, Manish and respondent No.1 sustained injuries on their person. After the accident, injured were taken to General Hospital, Sonepat where Parveen and Manish were declared dead and respondent No.1 was referred to PGIMS Rohtak. Said accident took place due to sole rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. Deceased Manish was aged about 20 years on the day of accident and was unmarried. Deceased Manish was a Truck Mechanic and also doing business of trucks on commission basis and used to earn Rs.30,000/- per month. All the claimants were fully dependent upon the income of deceased Manish, as he was sole bread-earner of his family. Claimants No.1 and 2 are parents of deceased Manish whereas claimants No.3 to 5 are younger minor brothers and sisters of deceased. Claimants spent an amount of Rs.one lac on the last rites of deceased. After the death of deceased, claimants have suffered from a great pain, mental torture and agony besides financial loss. Deceased Parveen was aged about 24 years on the day of accident and was married. Deceased Parveen was a Helper in SSIPL Retail Ltd. and was also running a dairy and business of cattle and used to earn Rs.22,000/- per month. All the claimants were fully dependent upon the income of deceased Parveen, as he was sole bread-earner of his family. Claimants No.1 is wife, claimant No.2 is minor daughter, claimants No.3 and 4 are parents of deceased Parveen whereas claimants No. 5 to 7 are younger brothers and sisters of deceased. Claimants spent an amount of Rs.one lac on the last rites of deceased. After the death of deceased, claimants have suffered from a great pain, mental torture and agony besides financial loss. 4. The accident was caused due to sole negligence of respondent No.1 driver of offending vehicle and respondent No.2 is registered owner of offending vehicle and the offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.3 at the time of accident and hence, all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to compensate the petitioners. 5.Respondent No.1 did not come present despite service, so, he was proceeded against exparte vide order dated 11.03.2015. 6.Respondent No.2 filed written statement taking preliminary objections regarding maintainability, cause of action, locus standi. On merits, respondent No.2 denied the allegations for want of knowledge and have further resisted the present claim petition on the grounds that no such accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 and a false FIR has been lodged against him. The amount spent on last rites of deceased has been shown on higher side. The amount claimed by the claimants is on very higher side, excessive, exorbitant and without any basis. exaggerated one. Claimants are not entitled to any compensation and prayed for the dismissal of the petitions. 7.The respondent No.3 insurance company in its separately filed written statement took preliminary objections regarding mis-joinder and non-joinder of parties, cause of action, locus standi, maintainability and pleaded that they took all defences provided under Sections 134C, 147, 149, 157 and 170 of Motor Vehicle Act. No such alleged accident ever took place with alleged offending vehicle and the same has been falsely involved by claimants in order to grab the compensation. On merits, again the factum of accident and death of Manish and Praveen denied and averred that the deceased Manish was not a truck mechanic nor doing business of sale-purchase of trucks. It is also denied that deceased Parveen was a Helper in SSIPL Retail Ltd. and was also running a dairy and business of cattle and used to earn Rs.22,000/- per month. In fact, both deceased had no income. Income of deceased have been shown much exaggerated and without any basis. A false FIR was got lodged against the respondent No.1 whereas Maruti Van bearing No.DL-3C-AG- 4412 was not involved in the alleged accident. The amount of compensation claimed is excessive and exorbitant. Respondent No.3 took some additional please that respondent No.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident and vehicle in question was being plied in contravention of terms and conditions of insurance police and therefore, answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. 8.Vide order dated 05.01.2016, both claim petitions were consolidated and it was ordered that further proceedings will be recorded in main claim petition titled as Mukesh & others Vs. Madan & others. 9.On the pleadings of parties, the following issues were settled for adjudication on 05.01.2016 - 1.Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of Maruti Van bearing registration No.DL-3C-AG-4412, by its driver- respondent No.1 on 06.12.2014 within the jurisdiction of police Station Sadar, Sonepat causing death of Manish and Parveen, as alleged ? OPP. 2.If issue No.1 is proved in affirmative to what amount of compensation, the petitioners are entitled to and from whom? OPP. 3.Whether the claim petition is not maintainable and petitioners have no cause of action and locus standi to file the present claim petitions?OPR 4.Whether the respondent No.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident. If so to what effect? OPR. 5.Whether respondent No.1 was driving the vehicle i.e. Maruti Van bearing Registration No.DL-3C-AG-4412 in violation of terms and conditions of insurance policy?OPR. 6.Relief. 10.In order to prove their case, petitioner Pooja appeared in the witness-box as PW1 and petitioner Jaipal as PW2. Claimants have also relied upon the following documents in evidence :- Ex.P1Copy of PMR of deceased Parveen. EX.P2Copy of Adhar Card of claimant Pooja Devi. Ex.P3Copy of Adhar Card of claimant Anand Parkash. Ex.P4Photo copy of ration card of claimant Anand Parkash. Ex.P5Copy of salary certificate of deceased Parveen. Ex.P6Photo copy of FIR Ex.P7Copy of PMR of deceased Manish. Ex.P8Copy of voter I.Card of claimant Mukesh. Ex.P9Copy of voter I.Card of claimant Jai Pal. Ex.P10Copy of ration card of claimant Jai Pal. Ex.P11Copy of certificate of secondary examination of deceased Manish Ex.P12Copy of final report u/s.173 Cr.P.C. EX.P13Copy of site plan of place of occurrence. Ex.P14Copy of FIR. Ex.P15Copy of charge-sheet. Ex.P16Copy of Adhar Card of deceased Parveen. 11.On the other hand to rebut the evidence of petitioners, respondents have not adduced any evidence. However, learned counsel for respondent No.2 has tendered into evidence following documents :- a)Ex.R1Copy of registration certificate. b)Ex.R2Copy of driving licence of respondent No.1 Madan. c)Ex.R3Photocopy of insurance policy. 12.I have heard the arguments on behalf of both sides and have gone through the case file, my issue-wise findings are as under - ISSUE No.1 13. Onus to prove this issue was upon the petitioners. Under this issue, petitioners were required to prove that on 6.12.2014 at about 10.15 P.M., accident took place due to negligence of respondent No.1 driver of offending vehicle bearing Registration No. No.DL-3CAG-4412, due to which, Manish and Parveen died. In order to prove this issue, petitioners Pooja and Jai Pal stepped into witness-box as PW1 and PW2 respectively and tendered their duly sworn affidavits Ex.PW1/A and Ex.PW2/A in their evidence and reiterated the averments of petition. Petitioner Jaipal PW2 is also alleged eye-witness of the occurrence. He deposed that on 6.12.2014, he alongwith his son Manish, Parveeen son of anand Parkash and Anand Parkash son of Roop Chander were going in a Barat from village Murthal in Maruti Van No.DL-3CAG-4412. Respondent No.1 was driving the vehicle at a high speed, rashly and negligently and without following traffic rules, due to which, offending vehicle struck against the divider and then pole, as a result of which deceased Manish and Parveen died. He has also deposed that on his statement, FIR No.475 dated 7.12.2014 under Sections 279/304A IPC was registered against respondent No.1. As against this cogent oral as well as documentary evidence regarding the manner of accident, no evidence whatsoever has been produced by the respondents. The respondent no.1 has not stepped into the witness-box to rebut the allegations and the evidence led by the petitioners. It is settled law that where driver of offending vehicle does not come forward to deny his negligence, there is a presumption that the claim of the claimant is correct. In this regard, reliance may be placed upon the law laid down in Raju & others Vs. Sukhvinder Singh and others, 2006(4) RCR(Civil) page 82 . Further, it is apparent that FIR Ex.P6 under Sections 279/304A IPC resulted into prosecution of respondent No.1 Madan and vide report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex.P12 and chargesheet Ex.P15, a prosecution was launched against respondent No.1. These facts are themselves sufficient corroboration to testimony of witnesses. In Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Shyam and others, reported in 1993(2) PLR 109, it is held by Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court that if FIR is registered against the driver, it is prima facie safe to conclude that the accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of the vehicle by its driver. Another plea of claimants is that in the above-mentioned accident, deceased Manish and Parveen had suffered injuries and such injuries proved fatal for them. To prove these facts, in addition to oral testimony of PWs, claimants have placed on record copies of Post Mortem Reports Ex.P1 and Ex.P7 of Parveen and Manish respectively which show that deceased had died on 6.12.2014 on account of injuries suffered by them on the same day. In view of my above discussions and reasonings and in the light of law discussed above, this Tribunal reached at the conclusion that said accident took place due to negligence of respondent No.1 being driver of offending vehicle, due to which, Manish and Parveen died. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners and against the respondents. I SSUE No.2 - 15.In claim petition titled as Mukesh & others Vs. Madan and others, claimants have claimed a compensation of Rs.60 lacs on account of death of Manish in the accident in question. It is the case of claimants that deceased Manish was truck mechanic and he also used to do sale-purchase of trucks on commission basis and in this way, he was earning Rs.30,000/- per month. Claimant Jaipal appeared in witness-box as PW2 and reiterated the above facts. However, the petitioners have not produced any documentary evidence to prove that deceased Manish was earning Rs.30,000/- per month. But, it has come in evidence that deceased Manish was a young and healthy person. In the given circumstances, the inference can be drawn that deceased Manish must be capable of earning equal to the income of unskilled labour and it can safely be assumed that deceased must have been earning minimum wage of unskilled labour which was about Rs.5500/- per month at the time of accident. Thus, annual income of deceased comes out to be Rs.66,000/- (Rs.5500/- x 12). 16.As far as the age of deceased Manish is concerned, it is claim of claimants that he was 20 years old at the time of his death. In PMR Ex.P7, age of deceased Manish has been mentioned as 19 years. In Secondary Examination Certificate Ex.P11, date of birth of deceased Manish has been mentioned as 01.12.1995. As per date of birth mentioned in Ex.P11, age of deceased Manish comes to 19 years on the date of accident. Hence, age of deceased is held to be 19 years at the time of his death. 17.Loss of dependency consists of three components for its determination viz. Future prospectus, income of deceased after deduction to be made and multiplier to be adopted. In Rajesh Vs. Rajbir etc., 2013, ACJ, 1403 , Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has laid down the formula for increase of income covering future prospectus. In the above mentioned case, it has been laid down that future prospectus shall be allowed 50% of actual income (after deduction of tax) for the persons below the age of 40 years, 30% for the age group of 40 to 50 years and 15% for the age group of 50 to 60 years and no addition thereafter. In the present case, the age of deceased has been held to be 19 years. Therefore, in view of law laid down in the case Rajesh Vs. Rajbir (supra) , 50% of actual income of deceased has to be increased towards future prospectus. After increased by 50%, annual income of deceased Manish comes out to be Rs.99,000/- (Rs.66,000/- + Rs.33,000/-). As far as deduction towards personal expenses of deceased is concerned, deceased Manish was unmarried at the time of accident and in the claim petition, the compensation has been claimed by his parents and minor sisters and brother who are stated to be only dependents of the deceased. Claimants No.1 and 2 being parents of deceased are first class legal heirs. Claimants No.3 to 5 being minor sisters and brother of deceased are second class legal heirs and being minors, they are fully dependent upon their parents i.e. claimants No.1 and 2 and hence, they are not entitled to any compensation. In view of these facts and relying upon the law laid down in case of Sarla Verma & Ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & others, 2009(3) RCR (Civil) page 77(SC) , ½ of the total income of deceased is to be deducted on account of personal and living expenses. After deducting ½ of the total income, annual dependency of claimants comes out to be Rs.49,500/-. Age of deceased has been held to be 19 years at the time of his death. In view of law laid down in Sarla Verma's case (supra) , the multiplier of '18' is applicable. By applying the multiplier of 18, total compensation comes to Rs.8,91,000/- (49,500/- x 18). Apart from that, claimants have also claimed compensation on account of loss of love and affection for claimants no.1 and 2 and an amount incurred on transportation and funeral and last rites of deceased. Claimants No.1 and 2 have lost their son. In view of Rajesh case (supra), Rs.50,000/- (Rs.fifty thousand only) is awarded to claimants No.1 and 2 for loss of love and affection and Rs.5,000/- (Rs. Five thousand only) towards expenses spent on transportation and Rs.10,000/- (Rs.ten thousand only) towards funeral expenses. Thus, total amount of compensation comes to Rs.9,56,000/- (Rs. nine lacs fiftysix thousand only). 18.In claim petition titled as Pooja & others Vs. Madan and others, claimants have claimed a compensation of Rs.60 lacs on account of death of Parveen in the accident in question. It is the case of claimants that deceased Parveen was working as helper in SSIPL Retails Ltd. and was also running a dairy and doing business of cattle. He was getting salary of Rs.5640/- per month. Deceased Parveen used to work on over-time and used to earn Rs.2500/- per month Regarding job and earnings of deceased, claimants have placed on file certificate Ex.P5. But Ex.P5 has not been proved by the claimants by examining concerned official from SSIPL Retails Ltd., so, Ex.P5 cannot be taken into consideration. Claimants have further claimed that deceased was also earning Rs.8000/- per month from dairy and Rs.6000/- from sale and purchase of cattle, but there is no proof about earnings of deceased on case file. But, it has come in evidence that deceased Parveen was a young and healthy person. In the given circumstances, the inference can be drawn that deceased Parveen must be capable of earning equal to the income of unskilled labour and it can safely be assumed that deceased must have been earning minimum wage of unskilled labour which was about Rs.5500/- per month at the time of accident. Thus, annual income of deceased comes out to be Rs.66,000/- (Rs.5500/- x 12). 16.As far as the age of deceased Parveen is concerned, it is claim of claimants that he was 24 years old at the time of his death. In PMR Ex.P1, age of deceased Parveen has been mentioned as 25 years. In copy of Adhar Card Ex.P16, only year of birth of deceased Parveen has been mentioned as 1988. As per year of birth mentioned in Ex.P16, age of deceased Parveen comes to about 26 years on the date of accident. Hence, taking into consideration Ex.P16, age of deceased is held to be 26 years at the time of his death. 17.As per formula for increase of income covering future prospectus Rajesh case (supra) , 50% of actual income of deceased has to be increased towards future prospectus as his age is held to be 26 years at the time of his death. After increase by 50%, annual income of deceased Parveen comes out to be Rs.99,000/- (Rs.66,000/- + Rs.33,000/-). As far as deduction towards personal expenses of deceased is concerned, deceased Parveen was married at the time of accident and in the claim petition, the compensation has been claimed by his widow, minor daughter, parents and two brothers and one sister and who are stated to be only dependents of the deceased. Claimants No.3 and 4 being parents of deceased are first class legal heirs. Claimants No. 5 to 7 being brothers and sister of deceased are second class legal heirs and being major, they are fully dependent upon themselves and hence, they are not entitled to any compensation. In view of these facts and relying upon the law laid down in case of Sarla Verma & Ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & others, 2009(3) RCR (Civil) page 77(SC) , 1/4th of the total income of deceased is to be deducted on account of personal and living expenses. After deducting 1/4th of the total income, annual dependency of claimants comes out to be Rs.74,250/-. Age of deceased has been held to be 26 years at the time of his death. In view of law laid down in Sarla Verma's case (supra) , the multiplier of '17' is applicable. By applying the multiplier of 18, total compensation comes to Rs.12,62,250/- (74,250/- x 17). Apart from that, claimants have also claimed compensation on account of loss of consortium for claimant No.1, loss of love and affection for claimants no.2 to 4 and an amount incurred on transportation and funeral and last rites of deceased. Claimant No.1 is widow of deceased Parveen. She lost her husband. She has lost valuable company of her husband at a young age and therefore, for the loss of consortium, she must be compensated adequately. In view of Rajesh case (supra), Rs. 1,00,000/- (Rs. One lac only) is awarded to claimant No.1 as a compensation for the loss of consortium being widow of deceased, Rs.1,00,000/- (Rs.one lac only) is awarded to claimant No.2 as a compensation for loss of love and affection and Rs.50,000/- (Rs.fifty thousand only) is awarded to claimants No.3 and 4 for loss of love and affection and Rs.5,000/- (Rs. Five thousand only) towards expenses spent on transportation and Rs.10,000/- (Rs.ten thousand only) towards funeral expenses. Thus, total amount of compensation comes to Rs.15,27,250/- (Rs. fifteen lacs twentyseven thousand two hundred fifty only). 18.The next question to be determined is as to by whom the compensation is to be paid? From the photocopy of insurance policy Ex.R3, it stands proved on record that the offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.3 i.e. insurance company w.e.f. 08.04.2014 to midnight on 07.04.2015, whereas the accident in question took place on 06.12.2014. Thus, the liability to make the payment shall be joint and several of all the respondents, but, ultimately liability of payment lies with respondent No.3 as offending vehicle was insured with it and respondent No.3 is bound to indemnify respondent No.2, the registered owner of offending vehicle. Accordingly, issue No.2 is decided in favour of petitioners. Issue No.3:- 14.Onus to prove this issue was upon the respondents. However, the respondents have not produced evidence to prove this issue. However, in view of findings given under issues No.1 and 2, it is held that the petitioners have a cause of action and locus standi to file the present petition and the present petition is maintainable. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of petitioners and against the respondents. Issues No.4 & 5 :- 15. Both the issues are taken together as the same are inter-connected. Onus to prove these issues was upon the respondents. Respondents have neither produced evidence to prove these issues nor pressed the same at the time of arguments. So, these issues are decided in favour of the petitioners and against the respondents. Relief - 24.In view of the findings of this Tribunal returned on the issues under adjudication, present petition succeeds and the same is accepted with costs. In claim petition titled as Mukesh & others Vs. Madan and others, the petitioners are awarded a compensation to the tune of Rs.9,56,000/ - (Rs.nine lacs fiftysix thousand only) with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of filing of petition till the date of realization. Petitioners No.1 & 2 are granted the amount of compensation in equal share and out of their share, Rs.1,28,000/- each in cash and remaining amount of Rs.3,50,000/- each shall be deposited in the shape of FDRs in their names in any nationalized bank of their choice for a period of one year. On majority of FDRs, the bank shall be entitled to released the amount in favour of respective claimant/FDR holder on its own level without asking for formal order of the Tribunal.

Sh.P.K.Bhagat, Advocate for respondent No.3. AWARD: The present petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as the Act) has been filed by the petitioners claiming compensation on account of death of Rajender son of Vishnu in a Motor Vehicular accident which took place on 7.12.2014 at about 3.20 p.m. in the area of police station, Rai, due to alleged rash and negligent driving of Motorcycle Bajaj Discover bearing No. HR-10V-2453 by respondent No.1. Petitioners have sought compensation to the tune of Rs.20 lacs. 2. The brief facts of the claimants ’ case are that on 7.12.2014 Rajender (since deceased) had gone to Baghpat for his personal work on his motorcycle bearing No. HR-10U-5250 and when he was coming from 3 Baghpat to his native village on his motorcycle at about 3.20 p.m. and when he reached ahead of village Garh Mirakpur and turned towards Palra mor, in the meantime, driver of the offending motorcycle bearing regd. No. HR-10V-2453 came from village Palra side and struck against the motorcycle of the petitioner. That there were two young boys on the motorcycle and the driver of the motorcycle Bearing No. HR-10V-2453 was driving his motorcycle in a very rash and negligent manner and at a very high speed and because of the impact of the accident, the riders of both the motorcycles fell down on the road in opposite directions and they were brought to the hospital for treatment by their family members. That Rajender (since deceased) suffered serious injuries in the said accident and he was shifted to Trauma Centre, Delhi and the doctors of Trauma Centre, Delhi sent an information to the police immediately after admission of Rajender in Trauma Centre on 8.12.2014 and one ASI of P.S. Rai then visited Trauma Centre and after taking opinion of the doctor about condition of injured Rajender recorded his statement and on the basis of his medical record, FIR No. 364 dated 10.12.2014 under section 279/337/338 IPC was registered at P.S. Rai, Sonepat. That the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. It is 4 further averred that Rajender suffered various fractures on his body and doctors implanted surgical rod in his body and he remained admitted in the hospital upto 20.12.2014 and thereafter he took treatment as outdoor patient from Lok Nayak hospital, New Delhi, but his condition became worst and due to injuries he developed infections in the body and ultimately he succumbed to the injuries on 3.1.2015 and his body was cremated without giving any information to the police and the police contacted the family of deceased Rajender on 5.1.2015 and took the statement of Monu, i.e. brother of Rajender, who told the police that Rajender died because of injuries suffered by him in the accident and the police did not take any action and produced the report u/s 173 Cr.P.C without adding section 304-A IPC. It is further averred that deceased/Rajender was 37 years of age and was working as helper in Hilton factory, village Dhaturi and was earning Rs.10,000/- per month. 3. Notice of the petition was given to the respondents and respondents No.1 and 2 filed joint reply pleading that a false case has been got registered against respondent No.1 in collusion with the local police with ulterior motive to extract money from the answering respondents as respondent No.1 was driving his motorcycle at a normal 5 speed on correct side of the road and by observing all the traffic rules and it was the deceased who was rash, negligent and careless in driving his motorcycle No.HR-10U-5250. Denying all the other material averments, respondents No. 1 & 2 have prayed for dismissal of the claim petition. 4. Respondent No.3, vide its reply, has taken preliminary objections regarding maintainability, cause of action, want of driving licence of the driver of the vehicle, violation of the terms & conditions of the insurance policy etc. On merits, it is stated that the respondent No. 1 was not having valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident and the vehicle was being driven in violation of the provisions of M.V. Act and against the terms of the policy and consequently the respondent no.3 Insurance Company is not liable to pay compensation, if any, to the claimants. Further pleaded that no accident took place with motorcycle bearing No. HR-10V-2453. Denying all other material averments, respondent no. 3 has prayed for dismissal of the claimants ’ petition. 5. No replication had been filed and on the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed for adjudication vide order dated 6.7.2015:- 6 1. Whether the death of Rajender son of Vishnu alias Vishnu Dutt is the result of accident which took place on 7.12.2014 due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle/ motorcycle regd. bearing No. HR-10V-2453 by its driver i.e. respondent No. 1? OPP 2 If issue no.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation the petitioners are entitled to and from whom? OPP 3. Whether respondent No.1 was not holding a valid driving licence at the time of accident and the offending vehicle had violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect? OPR-3 4. Relief 6. In support of their respective averments, the parties adduced their respective evidence. One of the claimants, namely, Santosh widow of deceased Rajender appeared as PW1 and claimants further examined Dr. Nidhi Sharma, Medical Officer, General Hospital, Sonepat as PW2, Surender, Criminal Ahlmad as PW3 and Dr.Sumit Gupta from Trauma Centre Delhi as PW4 and also placed on record Ex.P1 copy of MLR of deceased Rajender, Ex.P2 copy of FIR, Ex.P3 copy of report u/s 173 Cr.P.C., Ex.P5 copy of death certificate of Rajender, Ex.P6 Discharge 7 Summary, Ex.P7 to Ex.P14 receipts, Ex.P15 and Ex.P16 Photographs and closed the evidence on behalf of petitioner. 7. On the other hand, respondents have led no oral evidence, but tendered into evidence Ex. R1 copy of Cover Note, Ex.R2 Driving Licence Verification report, Ex.R3 RC Verification Report, Ex.R4 copy of Insurance Policy, Ex.R5 copy of Driving Licence, Ex.R6 copy of Registration Certificate and the evidence on behalf of said respondents was closed. 8.I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have also perused the case file carefully and minutely and issue-wise findings with reasons thereof are as under: ISSUE NO.1 9. In order to prove that the respondent No.1 i.e. driver of the offending vehicle motorcycle bearing No.HR-10V-2453 was driving the same in a rash and negligent manner, one of the petitioners namely, Smt.Santosh appeared as PW1 and deposed by way of tendering her affidavit Ex.PW1/A, thereby reiterating the averments made in the claim petition. The statement of PW1 finds corroboration vide Ex.P2 copy of FIR & Ex.P3 copy of report u/s 173 Cr.P.C . Further, PW3/Surender, 8 Criminal Ahlmad, had brought the summoned record of case file titled as ‘State Versus Lokesh son of Net Ram, resident of Palra, District Sonepat ’ in FIR No.364 of 2014 u/ss 279/337/338 IPC, P.S. Rai and stated that charge in this case was framed against accused on 11.2.2015 and now the case has been fixed for prosecution evidence for 10.12.2015 and copy of FIR Ex.P2 and copy of challan Ex.P3 is correct as per record brought by him. Further PW2/Dr. Nidhi Sharma proved the copy of MLR dated 7.12.2014 as Ex.P1. 10. To rebut the claim of the petitioners qua negligence of respondent no.1 in causing the accident in question, respondents have failed to lead any evidence. 11. It is settled law that it is the entire responsibility of the claimants to establish that the driver of the offending vehicle was driving the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner, which resulted into the accident. Further, with regard to standard of proof, it has been held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Parmeshwari Devi vs. Amir Chand and others, 2011(2) RCR (Civil)153, that in a claim pertaining to a road accident, the strict principles of proof in a criminal case are not attracted and that the claimants are merely to establish their case on the touch- 9 stone of preponderance of probabilities. With the above discussed law and evidence on record, this Tribunal is satisfied that the claimants have succeeded in establishing that on 7.12.2014 the offending vehicle was being driven by respondent No.1 in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident in question. PW1/Santosh, vide her affidavit Ex,PW1/A, has reiterated the averments made in the claim petition. The statement of PW1 finds corroboration vide deposition of PW3/Surender, Criminal Ahlmad, who had brought the summoned record of case file ti - tled as ‘State Versus Lokesh son of Net Ram, resident of Palra, District Sonepat’ in FIR No.364 of 2014 u/ss 279/337/338 IPC, P.S. Rai and stated that charge in this case was framed against accused on 11.2.2015 and now the case has been fixed for prosecution evidence for 10.12.2015 and copy of FIR Ex.P2 and copy of challan Ex.P3 are correct as per record brought by him. It is pertinent to mention here that the FIR bearing no. 364/2014 was lodged on the statement of injured Rajender who unfor - tunately expired later on due to the injuries sustained in the accident in question. A perusal of the FIR/Ex.P2 would reveal that the registration number of the offending vehicle has been specifically mentioned in the FIR and it is further alleged that the accident in question has been caused 10 due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle. Moreover the investigating agency investigated the matter and filed final report under section 173 Cr.P.C. against the driver/respondent no.1 vide Ex.P3. Still further, had the accident not been caused by respondent no.1 while driving the offending vehicle rashly and negligently, then there would have been no reason on the part of injured Rajender (since deceased) to lodge the FIR. Further, PW2/Dr.Nidhi has proved MLR/Ex.P1 and also stated that on 7.12.2014 she medico-legally examined Rajender at GH Sonepat. Further, Ex.P1 copy of MLR also makes out that deceased Rajender had received injuries in a road side accident on 7.12.2014. The deposition of PW1 coupled with the documents Ex.P2 copy of FIR & Ex.P3 copy of report u/s 173 Cr.P.C ., duly establish that the accident took place on account of rash and negligent driving of respondent No. 1. Though respondents no.1 & 2 have taken specific plea in the reply that the accident took place due to negligence of the deceased himself, how - ever they have failed to lead any evidence to that effect and to rebut the testimony of the claimants. H ad the accident not taken place as alleged by the petitioners, respondents No.1 & 2 would certainly have made complaints to the higher authorities regarding false implication of their 11 vehicle with regard to the accident, but no such event happened. As per Ex.P3/certified copy of final report under section 173 Cr.P.C., respondent no. 1 was challaned for causing the accident in question by rash and negligent driving, therefore, it is safe to conclude that the accident was result of sole rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No. 1. Reliance in this regard may be placed upon Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Shyam and others, 1993 (2) PLR 109 (P&H) & Gurdeep Kaur Vs. Tarsem Singh , 2008 (2) RCR (Civil) 774. Therefore, the evidence coming on record proves rash and negligent driving of respondent No. 1 in causing the accident in question. This Tribunal does not see any reason to disbelieve the evidence produced by the petitioners. In such circumstances, it is held that petitioners have proved that the accident in question had been caused due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No. 1, on the touch stone of preponderance of probabilities. This issue is accordingly decided in favour of petitioners and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.2 12. So far as the question of quantum of compensation is concerned, PW1/Smt. Santosh has stated that Rajender (since deceased) 12 suffered serious injuries in the accident and he was shifted to Trauma Centre, Delhi. Further stated that injured Rajender suffered various fractures on his body and doctors implanted surgical rod in his body and he remained admitted in the hospital upto 20.12.2014 and thereafter he took treatment as outdoor patient from Lok Nayak hospital, New Delhi, but his condition became worst and due to injuries he developed infections in the body and ultimately he succumbed to the injuries on 3.1.2015 and his body was cremated without giving any information to the police. Further stated that deceased Rajender was about 37 years of age and he had been working as helper in Hilton Factory, Dhaturi and used to draw salary of Rs.10,000/- per month. H owever during her cross- examination, she has admitted she had not brought any proof regarding employment and earning of her husband. 13. At this stage, learned counsel for respondent No. 3- insurance company has argued that the accident in question took place on 7.12.2014 and the deceased Rajender expired on 3.1.2015 and since no PMR of the deceased has come on record, so death of deceased Rajender cannot be stated to be result of accident in question and accordingly the claimants are not entitled to get any compensation. On the other hand, learned counsel for 13 petitioners has vehemently contended that the testimony of treating doctors would clearly establish that death of deceased Rajender was a result of injuries sustained by him in the accident in question. Learned counsel for claimants has referred to the testimony of PW2/Dr. Nidhi Sharma and PW4/Dr. Sumit Gupta in support of his contentions. PW2/ Dr. Nidhi Gupta has proved MLR/Ex.P1 of the injured/deceased. Further, PW4/ Dr. Sumit Gupta, Asstt. Professor, Maulana Azad Medical College and Sushruta Trauma Centra, Delhi deposed that patient Rajender son of Sh. Vishnu was admitted in their hospital on 7.12.2014 due to traffic accident and he was referred from Civil Hospital Sonepat vide MLC No. NS/25/14 and was discharged from our hospital on 20.12.2014. Further deposed that the patient was having serious multiple fractures may be between 5 to 10 with suspected head injury and two major surgeries of the patient were conducted. Further deposed that due to the serious injuries, patient may succumb at the time of trauma. Further deposed that although he was investigated thoroughly i.e. C.T. Scan of head, ultra sound abdomen and multiple x-rays, but some injury may be missed which can create problem later on and are usually picked in regular follow up and the same may be the reason of death and the same can be confirmed from the post mortem 14 report. Keeping in view the afore-stated testimonies of treating doctors, this court finds no force in the arguments raised by learned counsel for respondent No.3. It is suffice to observe that soon after the accident, injured was taken to Civil Hospital, Sonepat where from he was taken to Sushruta Trauma Centre, Delhi. PW-4/Dr. Sumit Gupta has duly deposed that some injury may be missed which can create problem later on and are usually picked in regular follow up and the same may be the reason of death . Though no post-mortem report of the deceased has come on record as no such post-mortem was got conducted by the petitioners due to ignorance, yet the same cannot be taken to be ground to come to a conclusion that there was no connection between the accident and the consequential death of the deceased. Rather the evidence coming on record fairly establish that the deceased had received several injuries in the accident on 7.12.2014 and injured Rajender received treatment at Sushruta Trauma Centre, Delhi from 7.12.2014 to 20.12.2014 and thus it would be too much to read in the arguments on behalf of the insurance company that the death of deceased could have been on account of cause other than the injuries sustained in the accident. Moreover it is trite to say that cause of accident can well be attributed to vehicular accident even if post-mortem was not done on the deceased. Thus, from the afore-discussed evidence on record, it is clearly 15 established that there is a clear and direct nexus between the injuries sustained by the injured Rajender in motor vehicular accident and his consequential death. 14. As has been discussed, claimants have failed to produce on record any proof regarding the income of the deceased. Therefore, in the ab - sence of any evidence regarding income of deceased, this tribunal is duty bound to assess the income of the deceased on notional basis and the princi - ple that is to be applied is that the amount of compensation should be just and fair. Keeping in view the fact that even an unskilled labourer did not earn less than Rs.6,000/- per month at the relevant time, the monthly income of the deceased is taken as Rs. 6,000/- per month. Further, since the depen - dents of the deceased are five in number and as per law laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sarla Verma and Others Versus Delhi Transport Corporation and Another, 2009 ACJ 1298, deceased might have spent 1/4th amount upon himself and the remaining 3/4th upon his family/dependents. Thus, the annual dependency upon the deceased comes out to be Rs. 54,000/- (Rs. 6,000/- x 3/4 x 12). Further petitioners have claimed that deceased Rajender was 37 years of age at the relevant time. There is no evidence to the contrary on the part of the respondents. So, in view of the law laid down in Sarla Verma's (supra) case multiplier of 15 16 is to be applied in this regard for arriving at just compensation to be awarded to the petitioners on account of their dependency upon the de - ceased. So the amount of compensation comes out to be Rs. 8,10,000/- (Rs. 54,000/- x 15). Further, there is no evidence to the contrary, so claimants are also held entitled to compensation of Rs.25,000/- on account of ex - penses incurred on funeral and transportation and compensation of Rs.One lac on account of loss of consortium as per the law laid down in Rajesh and Others Vs. Rajbir Singh and Others, 2013(3) RCR (civil) 170. Further a compensation of Rs.1,00,000/- each on account of loss of love & affection for the two minor children is also awarded on account of loss of their father in view of the law laid down in Juju Ku - ruvila & Others vs. Kunjujamma Mohan & Others, (2013)9 SCC 166. Thus, by way of conclusion, the total amount of compensation comes out to be Rs.11,35,000/-. 15. Further, petitioners have also placed on record medical bills Ex.P7, P10 to P12 regarding the treatment expenses incurred on treatment of deceased prior to his demise. The above-stated bills pertain to period during which injured remained admitted in Sushruta Trauma Centre and thus then same seem to be genuine. Thus petitioners incurred 17 approximately an amount of Rs.10,900/-. Accordingly, it is held that claimants are also entitled to receive an amount of Rs.10,900/- on account of medical expenses, besides amount of compensation of Rs. 11,35,000/- on account of loss of dependency. So, by way of conclusion made, the amount of compensation comes to be Rs. 11,45,900/-. 16. Now the next question to be determined under issue no.2 is as to by whom the said amount of compensation is payable. While deciding issue No.1, it has been held that accident in question was caused due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1, driver of the offending vehicle. Admittedly, respondent No.1 was the driver and respondent No.2 being the regd. owner of the vehicle, cannot escape their liability to pay the compensation to the claimants and accordingly, respondents No.1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation. Further, as per Ex.R4/copy of Insurance policy, the offending vehicle bearing no. HR -10V-2453 was duly insured with respondent no.3 Insurance Company for the period from 7.12.2014 to 6.12.2015 and the accident in question took place on 7.12.2014, meaning thereby that the vehicle in question was duly insured with the respondent No.3 at the time of accident. Therefore, respondent No.3 also cannot 18 escape from its liability to pay the awarded compensation. Accordingly, it is held that respondents No.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the awarded amount of compensation and hence this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners and against the respondents. Issue No.3 17.The onus to prove this issue lies upon respondent No.3. A perusal of Driving licence Ex.R5 of respondent No.1 reveals that he was competent to drive the offending vehicle and that driving licence is valid upto 3.12.2015 whereas the accident in question took place on 7.12.2014. Respondent No.3-Insurance company has failed to lead any evidence rebutting the genuineness of the driving licence/Ex.R5. Moreover respondent no.3 has also failed to adduce any evidence regarding violation of any of the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. Therefore, respondent No.3 failed to discharge the onus upon it to the effect that respondent No.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence on the date of accident or that the insured had violated any term of the policy. Consequently, this issue is decided against respondent No.3- Insurance Company. 19 RELIEF 18.As a result of findings returned under issue No.1 to 3, the claim petition filed by the petitioners is partly allowed and a compensation in the sum of Rs.11,45,900/- (Rs.Eleven lacs forty five thousand and nine hundred only) is awarded to the claimants on account of death of Rajender. Respondents No.1 to 3 being the driver, regd. owner and insurer respectively of the vehicle in question are jointly and severally liable to pay the awarded amount of compensation alongwith interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till its realization. Out of the amount to be disbursed to claimants, petitioner/ claimant No.3 i.e. Smt. Santosh i.e. widow of deceased Rajender shall be entitled to receive an amount of Rs. Five lacs. Petitioners No.2 to 5 shall be entitled to receive the remaining compensation in equal proportions. It is made clear that the share of the minor claimants/petitioners no 4 & 5 shall be deposited in fixed deposits in any of the nationalized banks/post office fetching maximum interest till they attain the age of majority. Out of the amount to be disbursed to petitioners no.1,2 & 3, 50% thereof shall be given to them in cash, and the remaining 50% of the amount to be disbursed to them alongwith upto 20 date interest, is ordered to be deposited in their names in fixed deposit schemes in any of the nationalized banks for a period of three years. The counsel fee is assessed at Rs.1100/-. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly. File be consigned to record room after due compliance.

The claim petition titled as Kamla Rathi and others Versus Rajender and others has been filed by the petitioners for compensation to the tune of Rs.70 lacs on account of death of their son Bhupender Rathi in the accident in question. 3. While providing the particulars as required under the Motor Vehicles Ram Phal & others Vs. Rajender & others. 4 Act and the Rules framed thereunder, claimants inter alia alleged that on 13.08.2013, deceased Vikas Dahiya and Bhupender Rathi alongwith Parveen son of Jasbir resident of village Tharu were travelling in Car bearing No.DL-4CAB-1807 from Delhi to Sonepat. When they reached after crossing bridge near Piau Maniyari, their car struck behind a Trolla bearing No.HR-47A/6654 which was standing on the road without any indicator and without any light. After the accident, vehicle bearing No.DL-4CAB-1807 got ablazed and Vikas Dahiya and Bhupender Rathi died on the spot due to burn injuries. A case FIR No.232 dated 13.3.2013 under Sections 283/337/304A IPC was registered in P.S. Kundli against the driver of Trolla. The accident took place due to wrong parking of said Trolla on public place without observing traffic rules. Deceased Vikas Dahiya and Bhupender Rathi were aged about 26 years at the time of their death. Both were students of LL.B., Delhi University. Deceased Vikas Dahiya was doing tuition work and was earning Rs.30,000/- per month, He was also a helping hand in agriculture. Under his guidance, Dairy was also maintained by the family and under his supervision, about Rs.40,000/- per month was income out of that daiary. After the death of their sons i.e. Vikas Dahiya and Bhupender Rathi, claimants have suffered from a great pain, mental torture and agony besides financial loss. The accident was caused due to sole negligence of respondent No.1 driver of offending vehicle and respondent No.2 is registered owner of offending vehicle and the offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.3 at the time of accident and hence, all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to compensate the petitioners. Ram Phal & others Vs. Rajender & others. 5 4.Respondents No.1 and 2 filed their joint written statement in which, most of the allegations of claim petitions were denied for want of knowledge and it was claimed that alleged accident took place due to sole negligence on the part of respondent No.4 who was driving the said car rashly and negligently. They further pleaded that the vehicle bearing No.HR-47A/6654 was parked on the right side of the road and indicators were on. Deceased were not earning anything and income of deceased has been shown highly excessive and the amount claimed is highly excessive, exorbitant and without any basis. The petition is wrong, false, frivolous and the accident did not take place due to fault of respondent No.1 and a false case has been got lodged against respondent No.1 by claimants. Respondent No.3 is liable to pay the compensation as the vehicle was insured with it. With these pleas, respondents No.1 and 2 prayed for dismissal of the present petition. 5.Respondent No.3 insurance company, in its reply took preliminary objections regarding non-joinder and mis-joinder of necessary parties and relied upon all the defences available to it under Motor Vehicles Act. The other preliminary objections regarding locus standi, cause of action and maintainability of petition were also taken. While claiming further, respondent No.3 alleged that the respondent No.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence and the alleged accident was not caused due to negligence of respondent No.1. In reply on merits, the allegations including earning capacity of deceased Vikas Dahiya as Rs.70,000/- per month were again controverted and further pleaded that such accident was never taken place with the vehicle bearing No.HR-47A/6654 and the same has been falsely involved by the claimants in collusion with the police and respondents No.1&2 in order to grab the compensation Ram Phal & others Vs.

Claimants have also relied upon post mortem report Ex.P1 of Bhupender Rathi. 11.On the other hand, no witness was examined by respondents. However, learned counsel for respondents No.1&2 tendered following documents :- Ram Phal & others Vs. Rajender & others. 8 1.Ex.R1Photocopy of driving licence of respondent No.1. 2.Ex.R2Photocopy of RC of vehicle No.HR-47A/6654. 3.Ex.R3Photocopy of insurance policy. 4.Ex.R4Photocopy of National Permit. 5.Ex.R5Photocopy of Certificate of Fitness. 12.Respondent No.3 tendered copy of Insurance policy as Ex.RA. 13.I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record carefully. My issue-wise findings alongwith reasons are as under:- ISSUE No.1(both cases) - 14.Onus to prove this issue was upon the petitioners. Under this issue, petitioners were required to prove that on 13.08.2013 at night, accident took place due to negligence of respondent No.1 i.e. driver of offending vehicle bearing Registration No. No.HR-47A/6654, due to which, Vikas Dahiya and Bhupender Rathi died at the spot. In order to prove this issue, petitioners Ramphal and Jaipal Rathi appeared in the witness-box as PW1. Petitioner Ramphal has also examined Ravinder, eye-witness of the occurrence, as PW2. Petitioners Ramphal and Jaipal Rathi tendered their duly sworn affidavits Ex.PW1/A in their evidence and reiterated the averments of petitions. PW2 Ravinder has also tendered his duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW2/A in his evidence and deposed that the accident in question was caused due to wrong parking of the offending vehicle by respondent No.1. Offending vehicle was wrongly stand on the road by respondent No.1 without any indicator or reflector, due to which, the car in which deceased were travelling, struck against offending vehicle and got ablazed and two occupants of said car i.e. Vikas Ram Phal & others Vs. Rajender & others. 9 Dahiya and Bhupender Rathi died at the spot due to burn injuries. He has also deposed that FIR No.2325 dated 13.8.2013 under Sections 283/337/304A IPC was registered in P.S. Kundli. Further, it is apparent that FIR Ex.P2 under Sections 283/337/304A IPC resulted into prosecution of respondent No.1 Rajender and vide report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex.P11, a prosecution was launched against respondent No.1. These facts are themselves sufficient corroboration to testimony of witnesses. Further, law is settled that if an offending vehicle is parked on the road without any parking light or indicator, it amounts to negligence on the part of driver of offending vehicle. In this regard, reliance can be placed on the law laid down in National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Sm. Kamaljit Kaur, 2013(2) Latest Judicial Reports page 143 and United India Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Neena Ghai, 2008 Legal Eagles (P&H) 799 . As against this cogent oral as well as documentary evidence regarding the manner of accident, no evidence whatsoever has been produced by the respondents. The respondent no.1 has not stepped into the witness-box to rebut the allegations and the evidence led by the petitioners. It is settled law that where driver of offending vehicle does not come forward to deny his negligence, there is a presumption that the claim of the claimant is correct. In this regard, reliance may be placed upon the law laid down in Raju & others Vs. Sukhvinder Singh and others, 2006(4) RCR(Civil) page 82 . Moreover, had respondent No.1 Rajender been falsely implicated in the criminal case, then he would have filed complaint to higher authorities regarding his false involvement, but, no such complaint is shown to have been filed. Another plea of claimants is that in the above-mentioned accident, Ram Phal & others Vs. Rajender & others. 10 deceased Vikas Dahiya and Bhupender Rathi had suffered injuries and such injuries proved fatal for them. To prove these facts, in addition to oral testimony of Pws, claimants have placed on record copy of Post Mortem Report Ex.P1 of Vikas Dahiya and Post Mortem Report of Bhupender Rathi which shows that deceased had died on 13.8.2013 on account of injuries suffered by them on the same day. In view of my above discussions and reasonings and in the light of law discussed above, this Tribunal reached at the conclusion that said accident took place due to negligence of respondent No.1 being driver of offending vehicle, due to which, Vikas Dahiya and Bhupender Rathi died. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners and against the respondents. I SSUE No.2(both cases) - 14.In claim petition titled as Ram Phal and other Vs. Rajender and others, claimants have claimed a compensation of Rs.50 lacs on account of death of their son Vikas Dahiya in the accident in question. It is the case of claimants that deceased Vikas Dahiya was earning Rs.30,000/- per month from tuition and Rs.40,000/- per month from dairy farming. Claimant Ram Phal appeared in witness- box as PW1 and PW2 Ravinder have also reiterated the above facts. However, the petitioners have not produced any documentary evidence to prove that deceased Vikas Dahiya was earning Rs.70,000/- per month. But, it has been proved that deceased Vikas Dahia was doing LL.B. from Delhi University at the time of accident in question. He was a young and healthy person. In the given circumstances, the inference can be drawn that deceased Vikas Dahiya must be capable of earning equal to the income of skilled labour. The prevailing rate of wages for skilled labour in Ram Phal & others Vs. Rajender & others. 11 Sonepat District has been fixed by the Labour Commissioner, Haryana as Rs.6289/- per month. In view of this rate, in my opinion, it shall be appropriate to access the income of deceased Vikas Dahiya to be Rs.6300/- per month. Thus, annual income of deceased comes out to be Rs.75,600/- (Rs.6300 x 12). 15.As far as the age of deceased Vikas Dahiys is concerned, it is claim of claimants that he was 26 years old at the time of his death. In PMR Ex.P1, age of deceased Vikas Dahiya has been mentioned as 23 years. Hence, age of deceased is held to be 23 years at the time of his death. 16.Loss of dependency consists of three components for its determination viz. Future prospectus, income of deceased after deduction to be made and multiplier to be adopted. In Rajesh Vs. Rajbir etc., 2013, ACJ, 1403, Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has laid down the formula for increase of income covering future prospectus. In the above mentioned case, it has been laid down that future prospectus shall be allowed 50% of actual income (after deduction of tax) for the persons below the age of 40 years, 30% for the age group of 40 to 50 years and 15% for the age group of 50 to 60 years and no addition thereafter. In the present case, the age of deceased has been held to be 23 years. Therefore, in view of law laid down in the case Rajesh Vs. Rajbir (supra), 50% of actual income of deceased has to be increased towards future prospectus. After increased by 50%, annual income of deceased Vikas Dahiya comes out to be Rs.1,13,400/-. As far as deduction towards personal expenses of deceased is concerned, deceased Vikas Dahiya was bachelor at the time of accident and in the claim petition, the compensation has been claimed by his parents who are stated to Ram Phal & others Vs. Rajender & others. 12 be only dependents of the deceased. In view of these facts and relying upon the law laid down in case of Sarla Verma & Ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & others, 2009(3) RCR (Civil) page 77(SC), half of the total income of deceased is to be deducted on account of personal and living expenses. After deducting ½ of the total income, annual dependency of claimants comes out to be Rs.56,700/-. Age of deceased has been held to be 23 years at the time of his death. In view of law laid down in Sarla Verma's case (supra) , the multiplier of '18' is applicable. By applying the multiplier of 18, total compensation comes to Rs.10,20,600/- (56,700/- x 18). In addition to this, petitioners are also entitled to Rs.50,000/- on account of love and affection and Rs.5000/- for the expenses spent on last rites and total amount of compensation comes to Rs.10,75,600/- (Rs.ten lacs seventyfive thousand six hundred only). 17.In claim petition titled as Kamla Rathi and other Vs. Rajender and others, claimants have claimed a compensation of Rs.70 lacs on account of death of their son Bhupender Rathi in the accident in question. Claimant Jaipal Rathi appeared in witness-box as PW1 and reiterated the contents of petition. PW1 has stated that deceased was doing LL.B. from Delhi University at the time of accident in question. He was a young and healthy person. In the given circumstances, the inference can be drawn that deceased Bhupender Rathi must be capable of earning equal to the income of skilled labour. The prevailing rate of wages for skilled labour in Sonepat District has been fixed by the Labour Commissioner, Haryana as Rs.6289/- per month. In view of this rate, in my opinion, it shall be appropriate to access the income of deceased Bhupender Rathi to be Rs.6300/- per month. Thus, Ram Phal & others Vs. Rajender & others. 13 annual income of deceased comes out to be Rs.75,600/- (Rs.6300 x 12). 18.As far as the age of deceased Bhupender Rathi is concerned, it is claim of claimants that he was 26 years old at the time of his death. In PMR, age of deceased Bhupender Rathi has been mentioned as 24 years. Hence, age of deceased is held to be 24 years at the time of his death. 19.Loss of dependency consists of three components for its determination viz. Future prospectus, income of deceased after deduction to be made and multiplier to be adopted. In Rajesh Vs. Rajbir etc., 2013, ACJ, 1403, Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has laid down the formula for increase of income covering future prospectus. In the above mentioned case, it has been laid down that future prospectus shall be allowed 50% of actual income (after deduction of tax) for the persons below the age of 40 years, 30% for the age group of 40 to 50 years and 15% for the age group of 50 to 60 years and no addition thereafter. In the present case, the age of deceased has been held to be 24 years. Therefore, in view of law laid down in the case Rajesh Vs. Rajbir (supra), 50% of actual income of deceased has to be increased towards future prospectus. After increased by 50%, annual income of deceased Vikas Dahiya comes out to be Rs.1,13,400/-. As far as deduction towards personal expenses of deceased is converned, deceased Bhupender Rathi was bachelor at the time of accident and in the claim petition, the compensation has been claimed by his parents who are stated to be only dependents of the deceased. In view of these facts and relying upon the law laid down in case of Sarla Verma & Ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & others, 2009(3) RCR (Civil) page 77(SC), half of the total income of deceased is to Ram Phal & others Vs. Rajender & others. 14 be deducted on account of personal and living expenses. After deducting ½ of the total income, annual dependency of claimants comes out to be Rs.56,700/-. Age of deceased has been held to be 23 years at the time of his death. In view of law laid down in Sarla Verma's case (supra) , the multiplier of '18' is applicable. By applying the multiplier of 18, total compensation comes to Rs.10,20,600/- (56,700/- x 18). In addition to this, petitioners are also entitled to Rs.50,000/- on account of love and affection and Rs.5000/- for the expenses spent on last rites and total amount of compensation comes to Rs.10,75,600/- (Rs.ten lacs seventyfive thousand six hundred only). 20.The next question to be determined is as to by whom the compensation is to be paid? It has been proved on record by documentary evidence i.e. insurance policy, the offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.3 i.e. New India Assurance Company Ltd. w.e.f. 03.04.2013 to 02.04.2014, whereas the accident in question took place on 13.08.2013. Thus, the liability to make the payment shall be joint and several of all the respondents, but, ultimately liability of payment lies with respondent No.3 as offending vehicle was insured with it and respondent No.3 is bound to indemnify respondent No.2, the registered owner of offending vehicle. Accordingly, issue No.2 is decided in favour of petitioners. Issue No.3(both cases) - 21.Onus to prove this issue was on the respondent No.3 but this issue was not pressed by the counsel for respondent No.3 during the course of arguments. Hence, this issue is decided against respondent No.3. Relief (both cases)- Ram Phal & others Vs. Rajender & others. 15 22.In view of the findings of this Tribunal returned on the issues under adjudication, both the petitions succeed and the same are accepted with costs. The petitioners in case titled as Ram Phal etc. Vs. Rajender etc. are awarded a compensation to the tune of Rs.10,75,600 /- (Rs.ten lacs seventyfive thousand six hundred only) with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of filing of petition till the date of realization.

The claim petition titled as Kamla Rathi and others Versus Rajender and others has been filed by the petitioners for compensation to the tune of Rs.70 lacs on account of death of their son Bhupender Rathi in the accident in question. 3. While providing the particulars as required under the Motor Vehicles Ram Phal & others Vs. Rajender & others. 4 Act and the Rules framed thereunder, claimants inter alia alleged that on 13.08.2013, deceased Vikas Dahiya and Bhupender Rathi alongwith Parveen son of Jasbir resident of village Tharu were travelling in Car bearing No.DL-4CAB-1807 from Delhi to Sonepat. When they reached after crossing bridge near Piau Maniyari, their car struck behind a Trolla bearing No.HR-47A/6654 which was standing on the road without any indicator and without any light. After the accident, vehicle bearing No.DL-4CAB-1807 got ablazed and Vikas Dahiya and Bhupender Rathi died on the spot due to burn injuries. A case FIR No.232 dated 13.3.2013 under Sections 283/337/304A IPC was registered in P.S. Kundli against the driver of Trolla. The accident took place due to wrong parking of said Trolla on public place without observing traffic rules. Deceased Vikas Dahiya and Bhupender Rathi were aged about 26 years at the time of their death. Both were students of LL.B., Delhi University. Deceased Vikas Dahiya was doing tuition work and was earning Rs.30,000/- per month, He was also a helping hand in agriculture. Under his guidance, Dairy was also maintained by the family and under his supervision, about Rs.40,000/- per month was income out of that daiary. After the death of their sons i.e. Vikas Dahiya and Bhupender Rathi, claimants have suffered from a great pain, mental torture and agony besides financial loss. The accident was caused due to sole negligence of respondent No.1 driver of offending vehicle and respondent No.2 is registered owner of offending vehicle and the offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.3 at the time of accident and hence, all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to compensate the petitioners. Ram Phal & others Vs. Rajender & others. 5 4.Respondents No.1 and 2 filed their joint written statement in which, most of the allegations of claim petitions were denied for want of knowledge and it was claimed that alleged accident took place due to sole negligence on the part of respondent No.4 who was driving the said car rashly and negligently. They further pleaded that the vehicle bearing No.HR-47A/6654 was parked on the right side of the road and indicators were on. Deceased were not earning anything and income of deceased has been shown highly excessive and the amount claimed is highly excessive, exorbitant and without any basis. The petition is wrong, false, frivolous and the accident did not take place due to fault of respondent No.1 and a false case has been got lodged against respondent No.1 by claimants. Respondent No.3 is liable to pay the compensation as the vehicle was insured with it. With these pleas, respondents No.1 and 2 prayed for dismissal of the present petition. 5.Respondent No.3 insurance company, in its reply took preliminary objections regarding non-joinder and mis-joinder of necessary parties and relied upon all the defences available to it under Motor Vehicles Act. The other preliminary objections regarding locus standi, cause of action and maintainability of petition were also taken. While claiming further, respondent No.3 alleged that the respondent No.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence and the alleged accident was not caused due to negligence of respondent No.1. In reply on merits, the allegations including earning capacity of deceased Vikas Dahiya as Rs.70,000/- per month were again controverted and further pleaded that such accident was never taken place with the vehicle bearing No.HR-47A/6654 and the same has been falsely involved by the claimants in collusion with the police and respondents No.1&2 in order to grab the compensation Ram Phal & others Vs. Rajender & others. 6 from the answering respondent and a false case has been got registered.

Claimants have also relied upon post mortem report Ex.P1 of Bhupender Rathi. 11.On the other hand, no witness was examined by respondents. However, learned counsel for respondents No.1&2 tendered following documents :- Ram Phal & others Vs. Rajender & others. 8 1.Ex.R1Photocopy of driving licence of respondent No.1. 2.Ex.R2Photocopy of RC of vehicle No.HR-47A/6654. 3.Ex.R3Photocopy of insurance policy. 4.Ex.R4Photocopy of National Permit. 5.Ex.R5Photocopy of Certificate of Fitness. 12.Respondent No.3 tendered copy of Insurance policy as Ex.RA. 13.I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record carefully. My issue-wise findings alongwith reasons are as under:- ISSUE No.1(both cases) - 14.Onus to prove this issue was upon the petitioners. Under this issue, petitioners were required to prove that on 13.08.2013 at night, accident took place due to negligence of respondent No.1 i.e. driver of offending vehicle bearing Registration No. No.HR-47A/6654, due to which, Vikas Dahiya and Bhupender Rathi died at the spot. In order to prove this issue, petitioners Ramphal and Jaipal Rathi appeared in the witness-box as PW1. Petitioner Ramphal has also examined Ravinder, eye-witness of the occurrence, as PW2. Petitioners Ramphal and Jaipal Rathi tendered their duly sworn affidavits Ex.PW1/A in their evidence and reiterated the averments of petitions. PW2 Ravinder has also tendered his duly sworn affidavit Ex.PW2/A in his evidence and deposed that the accident in question was caused due to wrong parking of the offending vehicle by respondent No.1. Offending vehicle was wrongly stand on the road by respondent No.1 without any indicator or reflector, due to which, the car in which deceased were travelling, struck against offending vehicle and got ablazed and two occupants of said car i.e. Vikas Ram Phal & others Vs. Rajender & others. 9 Dahiya and Bhupender Rathi died at the spot due to burn injuries. He has also deposed that FIR No.2325 dated 13.8.2013 under Sections 283/337/304A IPC was registered in P.S. Kundli. Further, it is apparent that FIR Ex.P2 under Sections 283/337/304A IPC resulted into prosecution of respondent No.1 Rajender and vide report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex.P11, a prosecution was launched against respondent No.1. These facts are themselves sufficient corroboration to testimony of witnesses. Further, law is settled that if an offending vehicle is parked on the road without any parking light or indicator, it amounts to negligence on the part of driver of offending vehicle. In this regard, reliance can be placed on the law laid down in National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Sm. Kamaljit Kaur, 2013(2) Latest Judicial Reports page 143 and United India Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Neena Ghai, 2008 Legal Eagles (P&H) 799 . As against this cogent oral as well as documentary evidence regarding the manner of accident, no evidence whatsoever has been produced by the respondents. The respondent no.1 has not stepped into the witness-box to rebut the allegations and the evidence led by the petitioners. It is settled law that where driver of offending vehicle does not come forward to deny his negligence, there is a presumption that the claim of the claimant is correct. In this regard, reliance may be placed upon the law laid down in Raju & others Vs. Sukhvinder Singh and others, 2006(4) RCR(Civil) page 82 . Moreover, had respondent No.1 Rajender been falsely implicated in the criminal case, then he would have filed complaint to higher authorities regarding his false involvement, but, no such complaint is shown to have been filed. Another plea of claimants is that in the above-mentioned accident, Ram Phal & others Vs. Rajender & others. 10 deceased Vikas Dahiya and Bhupender Rathi had suffered injuries and such injuries proved fatal for them. To prove these facts, in addition to oral testimony of Pws, claimants have placed on record copy of Post Mortem Report Ex.P1 of Vikas Dahiya and Post Mortem Report of Bhupender Rathi which shows that deceased had died on 13.8.2013 on account of injuries suffered by them on the same day. In view of my above discussions and reasonings and in the light of law discussed above, this Tribunal reached at the conclusion that said accident took place due to negligence of respondent No.1 being driver of offending vehicle, due to which, Vikas Dahiya and Bhupender Rathi died. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners and against the respondents. I SSUE No.2(both cases) - 14.In claim petition titled as Ram Phal and other Vs. Rajender and others, claimants have claimed a compensation of Rs.50 lacs on account of death of their son Vikas Dahiya in the accident in question. It is the case of claimants that deceased Vikas Dahiya was earning Rs.30,000/- per month from tuition and Rs.40,000/- per month from dairy farming. Claimant Ram Phal appeared in witness- box as PW1 and PW2 Ravinder have also reiterated the above facts. However, the petitioners have not produced any documentary evidence to prove that deceased Vikas Dahiya was earning Rs.70,000/- per month. But, it has been proved that deceased Vikas Dahia was doing LL.B. from Delhi University at the time of accident in question. He was a young and healthy person. In the given circumstances, the inference can be drawn that deceased Vikas Dahiya must be capable of earning equal to the income of skilled labour. The prevailing rate of wages for skilled labour in Ram Phal & others Vs. Rajender & others. 11 Sonepat District has been fixed by the Labour Commissioner, Haryana as Rs.6289/- per month. In view of this rate, in my opinion, it shall be appropriate to access the income of deceased Vikas Dahiya to be Rs.6300/- per month. Thus, annual income of deceased comes out to be Rs.75,600/- (Rs.6300 x 12). 15.As far as the age of deceased Vikas Dahiys is concerned, it is claim of claimants that he was 26 years old at the time of his death. In PMR Ex.P1, age of deceased Vikas Dahiya has been mentioned as 23 years. Hence, age of deceased is held to be 23 years at the time of his death. 16.Loss of dependency consists of three components for its determination viz. Future prospectus, income of deceased after deduction to be made and multiplier to be adopted. In Rajesh Vs. Rajbir etc., 2013, ACJ, 1403, Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has laid down the formula for increase of income covering future prospectus. In the above mentioned case, it has been laid down that future prospectus shall be allowed 50% of actual income (after deduction of tax) for the persons below the age of 40 years, 30% for the age group of 40 to 50 years and 15% for the age group of 50 to 60 years and no addition thereafter. In the present case, the age of deceased has been held to be 23 years. Therefore, in view of law laid down in the case Rajesh Vs. Rajbir (supra), 50% of actual income of deceased has to be increased towards future prospectus. After increased by 50%, annual income of deceased Vikas Dahiya comes out to be Rs.1,13,400/-. As far as deduction towards personal expenses of deceased is concerned, deceased Vikas Dahiya was bachelor at the time of accident and in the claim petition, the compensation has been claimed by his parents who are stated to Ram Phal & others Vs. Rajender & others. 12 be only dependents of the deceased. In view of these facts and relying upon the law laid down in case of Sarla Verma & Ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & others, 2009(3) RCR (Civil) page 77(SC), half of the total income of deceased is to be deducted on account of personal and living expenses. After deducting ½ of the total income, annual dependency of claimants comes out to be Rs.56,700/-. Age of deceased has been held to be 23 years at the time of his death. In view of law laid down in Sarla Verma's case (supra) , the multiplier of '18' is applicable. By applying the multiplier of 18, total compensation comes to Rs.10,20,600/- (56,700/- x 18). In addition to this, petitioners are also entitled to Rs.50,000/- on account of love and affection and Rs.5000/- for the expenses spent on last rites and total amount of compensation comes to Rs.10,75,600/- (Rs.ten lacs seventyfive thousand six hundred only). 17.In claim petition titled as Kamla Rathi and other Vs. Rajender and others, claimants have claimed a compensation of Rs.70 lacs on account of death of their son Bhupender Rathi in the accident in question. Claimant Jaipal Rathi appeared in witness-box as PW1 and reiterated the contents of petition. PW1 has stated that deceased was doing LL.B. from Delhi University at the time of accident in question. He was a young and healthy person. In the given circumstances, the inference can be drawn that deceased Bhupender Rathi must be capable of earning equal to the income of skilled labour. The prevailing rate of wages for skilled labour in Sonepat District has been fixed by the Labour Commissioner, Haryana as Rs.6289/- per month. In view of this rate, in my opinion, it shall be appropriate to access the income of deceased Bhupender Rathi to be Rs.6300/- per month. Thus, Ram Phal & others Vs. Rajender & others. 13 annual income of deceased comes out to be Rs.75,600/- (Rs.6300 x 12). 18.As far as the age of deceased Bhupender Rathi is concerned, it is claim of claimants that he was 26 years old at the time of his death. In PMR, age of deceased Bhupender Rathi has been mentioned as 24 years. Hence, age of deceased is held to be 24 years at the time of his death. 19.Loss of dependency consists of three components for its determination viz. Future prospectus, income of deceased after deduction to be made and multiplier to be adopted. In Rajesh Vs. Rajbir etc., 2013, ACJ, 1403, Hon'ble Supreme Court of India has laid down the formula for increase of income covering future prospectus. In the above mentioned case, it has been laid down that future prospectus shall be allowed 50% of actual income (after deduction of tax) for the persons below the age of 40 years, 30% for the age group of 40 to 50 years and 15% for the age group of 50 to 60 years and no addition thereafter. In the present case, the age of deceased has been held to be 24 years. Therefore, in view of law laid down in the case Rajesh Vs. Rajbir (supra), 50% of actual income of deceased has to be increased towards future prospectus. After increased by 50%, annual income of deceased Vikas Dahiya comes out to be Rs.1,13,400/-. As far as deduction towards personal expenses of deceased is converned, deceased Bhupender Rathi was bachelor at the time of accident and in the claim petition, the compensation has been claimed by his parents who are stated to be only dependents of the deceased. In view of these facts and relying upon the law laid down in case of Sarla Verma & Ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & others, 2009(3) RCR (Civil) page 77(SC), half of the total income of deceased is to Ram Phal & others Vs. Rajender & others. 14 be deducted on account of personal and living expenses. After deducting ½ of the total income, annual dependency of claimants comes out to be Rs.56,700/-. Age of deceased has been held to be 23 years at the time of his death. In view of law laid down in Sarla Verma's case (supra) , the multiplier of '18' is applicable. By applying the multiplier of 18, total compensation comes to Rs.10,20,600/- (56,700/- x 18). In addition to this, petitioners are also entitled to Rs.50,000/- on account of love and affection and Rs.5000/- for the expenses spent on last rites and total amount of compensation comes to Rs.10,75,600/- (Rs.ten lacs seventyfive thousand six hundred only). 20.The next question to be determined is as to by whom the compensation is to be paid? It has been proved on record by documentary evidence i.e. insurance policy, the offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.3 i.e. New India Assurance Company Ltd. w.e.f. 03.04.2013 to 02.04.2014, whereas the accident in question took place on 13.08.2013. Thus, the liability to make the payment shall be joint and several of all the respondents, but, ultimately liability of payment lies with respondent No.3 as offending vehicle was insured with it and respondent No.3 is bound to indemnify respondent No.2, the registered owner of offending vehicle. Accordingly, issue No.2 is decided in favour of petitioners. Issue No.3(both cases) - 21.Onus to prove this issue was on the respondent No.3 but this issue was not pressed by the counsel for respondent No.3 during the course of arguments. Hence, this issue is decided against respondent No.3. Relief (both cases)- Ram Phal & others Vs. Rajender & others. 15 22.In view of the findings of this Tribunal returned on the issues under adjudication, both the petitions succeed and the same are accepted with costs. The petitioners in case titled as Ram Phal etc. Vs. Rajender etc. are awarded a compensation to the tune of Rs.10,75,600 /- (Rs.ten lacs seventyfive thousand six hundred only) with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of filing of petition till the date of realization.

IN THE COURT OF SUSHIL KUMAR, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 30 & 31 of 15.01.2015 Smt. Suresh etc. Vs. Paramjit etc. and Sarita Vs Paramjit etc. 8 D.O.D. 24.08.2016 4.Whether the respondent No.1 was not holding valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident if so its effect?

OPR. 6.Relief. 12.In order to prove their case, petitioners have examined PW1 Vijay and PW 2 Smt. Suresh. 13.No other witness was examined by the respondents. 14.I have heard learned counsels appearing on behalf of both sides and perused the record carefully. My issue-wise findings along with reasons are as under:- ISSUE NO. 1 :- 15.In order to prove this issue, petitioners have examined PW 1 Vijay who has deposed in his affidavit Ex. PW 1/A that on the date of IN THE COURT OF SUSHIL KUMAR, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 30 & 31 of 15.01.2015 Smt. Suresh etc. Vs. Paramjit etc. and Sarita Vs Paramjit etc. 9 D.O.D. 24.08.2016 accident he was coming with deceased Asha and petitioner Sarita and he witnessed the accident in question. He has specifically deposed that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No. 1. The postmortem report Ex. P3 shows that deceased Asha was taken to Safdarjang Hospital, Delhi with alleged history of road traffic accident and hit by a Scorpio Car while returning from school on 15.5.2012. The respondents No. 1 & 2 have admitted in their written statement that the accident in question was cause by respondent No.1 by driving the offending vehicle. They have stated that the accident in question took place because a buffalo suddenly came on the road. The respondents have not examined any witness in their evidence and therefore, this plea of respondents can not be believed. Therefore, it is concluded that the petitioners have been able to prove issue No. 1. Hence, Issue No. 1 is decided in favour of petitioners. ISSUE No. 2:- Smt. Suresh & another Vs. Paramjit & others:- IN THE COURT OF SUSHIL KUMAR, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 30 & 31 of 15.01.2015 Smt. Suresh etc. Vs. Paramjit etc. and Sarita Vs Paramjit etc. 10 D.O.D. 24.08.2016 16.The petitioners have stated that the age of the deceased was 13 years and she was student of 7th Class. Therefore, it is proved that the deceased was not earning anything. It has been held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Lata Vadhwa Vs. State of Bihar 2001 (8) SCC 197 that neither the income of the deceased child is capable of assessment on estimated basis nor the financial loss suffered by the parents is capable of mathematical computation. In case of Manwari Vs. Harsh Vardhan 2010 ACJ 1977 (Delhi) deceased was a girl of six years and claimant was her mother. Notional income of the deceased was taken at 15,000/- per annum and multiplier of 15 was adopted. 75,000/- ₹ ₹ were granted for loss of love and affection. In the present case the age of the deceased was 13 years and the petitioner have claimed that the contribution of the deceased in house hold works was 2,000/- per month. In the facts ₹ and circumstances of the case, notional income of the deceased can not be assessed as 2000/- per month which comes to 24,000/- per annum. ₹ ₹ IN THE COURT OF SUSHIL KUMAR, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 30 & 31 of 15.01.2015 Smt. Suresh etc. Vs. Paramjit etc. and Sarita Vs Paramjit etc. 11 D.O.D. 24.08.2016 17.By applying the multiplier of 15, total loss of income comes to 3,60,000/- (Rs. Three Lacs sixty thousands only). ₹ 18.Besides, an amount of 25,000/- for loss of funeral expenses ₹ and 75,000/- for loss of love and affection are also allowed to the ₹ petitioners. 19.In view of my above discussion, it is concluded that petitioners Smt. Suresh & another are entitled to compensation of 4,60,000 only (Rs. ₹ Four Lacs sixty thousands only). Therefore, this issue is partly decided in favour of petitioners. Sarita Vs. Paramjit & Others 20.Petitioner Sarita is minor and she has filed the claim petition through her father. PW 2 Smt. Suresh is mother of petitioner Sarita. Petitioner has alleged in the claim petition that a sum of 80,000/- was ₹ spent on treatment, a sum of 15,000/- was spent on transportation and a ₹ sum of 25,000/- was spent on special diet. However, the petitioner has not ₹ produced any evidence for proving the expenses on transportation and IN THE COURT OF SUSHIL KUMAR, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 30 & 31 of 15.01.2015 Smt. Suresh etc. Vs. Paramjit etc. and Sarita Vs Paramjit etc. 12 D.O.D. 24.08.2016 special diet. The petitioner has only tendered the disability certificate Ex. P2 in her evidence which shows that she has suffered permanent disability to the accident of 20%. It may be assumed that the petitioner have spent some amount treatment on transportation and special diet. It may also be assumed that the petitioner must have suffered pain and agony due to the injuries sustained in the accident. Keeping in view all facts and circumstances of the case, a sum of ₹ 70,000/- (Rs. Seventy thousands only) is allowed to the petitioner as compensation. ISSUES NO. 3 to 5:- 21.The onus to prove these issues is on the respondents, but these issues were not pressed by learned counsel for the respondents during course of argument. Hence, these issues are decided against the respondents. RELIEF:- IN THE COURT OF SUSHIL KUMAR, MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, SONEPAT. MACP/CIS Nos. 30 & 31 of 15.01.2015 Smt. Suresh etc. Vs.
