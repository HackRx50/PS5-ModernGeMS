This petition has been filed under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act by the dependents of the deceased Nagamani, who sustained fatal injuries in a motor accident seeking for compensation of Rs.70,00,000/-. 2. The averments made in the petition are briefly as follows :- The petitioners stated that on 17.9.2015 at about 10.00 A.M, while the deceased Nagamani was traveling in the Car bearing Reg.No.TN-18-S-4765 at Peranambut to Ambur road, Mathinapalli burial ground turning, its dirver drove the car in a high speed with rash and negligent manner and endangering human life and without following the traffic rules and suddenly applied brake and the car was upset. In that result the deceased sustained grievous injury in the head and all over the body and died in C.M.C Hospital,Vellore. The accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the Car bearing Regn.No.TN-18-S-4765. The 1st respondent is the owner of the said Car, 2nd respondent is the insurer of the said Car. Both are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the petitioners. 3. The 1st respondent inspite of receiving notice not appeared and hence called absent and set exparte on 29.04.2016. 3 4. The averments made in the counter filed by the Second respondent are briefly as follows :-. The petition is not maintainable either in law or on facts. All the petition averments are denied except those that are admitted by the respondent herein. This respondent does not admit the manner of accident alleged in the petition and this respondent submit that the car was driven carefully and slowly adhering the road principles and unexpectedly while the car was proceeding, a cattle suddenly crossed the road by running. The same could not have been anticipated by the driver and in order to avoid hitting the cattle the driver applied brakes and therefore the car was upset. The driver was not at fault. This respondent further submit that the deceased was an unauthorized person in the car and more than the permitted numbers traveled in the car and hence this respondent is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. The age, occupation and monthly income of the deceased are all not admitted. Compensation claimed by the petitioners are very high. This respondent reserves his right to file additional counter if further particulars are furnished. Hence, the petition is liable to be dismissed. 5. The point for consideration in this petition are as follows :- (1)Whether this accident was occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent's Car bearing Reg.No.TN-18-S-4765 ? (2)Who is liable to pay the compensation? (3)Whether the petitioners are entitled to compensation? and if so, what is the quantum? 4 6. On the side of the petitioners, two witnesses have been examined as P.W.1 and P.W.2 and 8 documents have been marked as Ex.P1 to P8 On the side of 2nd respondent, no witnesses has been examined and no document marked. Hence there is no contra evidence on the side of respondents 7. Point No.1:- (i) It is the case of the petitioners that on 17.9.2015 at about 10.00 A.M, while the deceased Nagamani was traveling in the Car bearing Regn.No.TN-18-S- 4765 at Peranambut to Ambur road, Mathinapalli burial ground turning, its dirver drove the car in a high speed with rash and negligent manner and endangering human life and without following the traffic rules and suddenly applied brake and the car was upset. In that result the deceased sustained grievous injury in the head and all over the body and died in C.M.C Hospital, Vellore. The accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the Car bearing Regn.No.TN-18-S-4765. (ii) To prove the case of the petitioners, the 1st petitioner has been examined as PW1 and she filed the true copy of FIR the same is marked as Ex.P1. The driver of the 1st respondent Car bearing Regn.No.TN-18-S-4765 was shown in the accused column. The PW2 also stated that the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent Car. The Second Respondent has not brought anything contra from the cross examination of PW1 and PW2 as to the cause of the accident. Though the second respondent in his counter has stated 5 that unexpectedly while the car was proceeding, a cattle suddenly crossed the road by running. The same could not have been anticipated by the driver and in order to avoid hitting the cattle the driver applied brakes and therefore the car was upset. To prove the same, the 2nd respondent has not filed any oral or documentary evidence and the first respondent or his driver have not taken steps to quash the FIR which was registered as against driver of the car. iii) Hence, from the oral evidence of P.W.1 P.W.2 and the documentary evidence of Ex.P1, the true copy of FIR and since there is no contra evidence available to disprove the accident, this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the accident has occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent's Car bearing Regn.No.TN-18-S-4765 . Thus the Point No.(1) is answered accordingly. 8. Point No.(2):- In Point No.(1), it has been found that the accident has occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent's Car bearing Regn.No.TN-18-S-4765. (ii) The petitioners in their petition mentioned that the first respondent's vehicle is insured with the second respondent under Policy No.35101031146135809565 valid from 09.01.2015 to 08.01.2016. The date of accident is 17.09.2015 and also filed the copy of the said Insurance Policy and the same has been marked as Ex.P.5. The 2nd respondent did not file any documentary 6 evidence to disprove the accident and also not denied about the policy copy filed by the petitioner. Hence, this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the 2nd respondent being the insurer is liable to pay the compensation to the Petitioners. Accordingly the Point No.(2) is answered. 9. Point No.(3):­ (i) The 1st petitioner has been examined as PW1. In the postmortem certificate marked as Ex.P2 through P.W.1, it has been stated that the deceased would appear to have died due to '' Cranio- Cerebral Injuries"". From the above document, the petitioners have proved that the deceased d ied due to the accident. In the petition, it has been stated that the 1st Petitioner is the wife and the Petitioners 2 and 3 are are the daughters and the 4th petitioner and the 5th petitioner are the mother and father of the deceased and they are the only legal heirs to the deceased. In the Legal Heir certificate which is marked as Ex.P.3, the Petition ers 1 to 5 are shown as the Legal heirs of the deceased Mr. Nagamani. Though the Father of the deceased is class II heir, this Tribunal considers that he is the dependant of the deceased. Therefore, this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the Petitioners 1 to 5 are entitled to the compensation. (ii) As per the judgement in Smt. Sarla Verma & Ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & Anr. The age of the deceased is decided as 28 years as per Ex.P.7 Driving Licence of the deceased Nagamani. 7 Monthly & Annual Income of the deceased : (iii) In the petition, it has been stated that at the time of accident, the deceased was the Driver cum Owner of the Lorry and working with Courier Parcel service loading and unloading and earning a sum of Rs.30,000/- per month. But to prove the deceased’s avocation and income, No oral or documentary evidence produced before this Tribunal. Hence in these circumstances, notional income has to be determined. Therefore this Tribunal considering the age of the deceased, is inclined to fix a sum of Rs.8,000/- as the monthly notional income of the deceased. As per the Judgment of Hon’ble Apex court passed in SLP (civil) 25590/2014 Dated 31.10.17 between National Ins. Co. Ltd., ..Vs.. Pranay Sethi and others 40 % future prospectus would be added, it will come to a sum of Rs.11,200/-. Thus, the annual income of the deceased would be Rs.11,200 X12= 1,34,400/-. Number of Dependents : (iv)The petitioners 1 to 5 are the dependents of the deceased. Therefore, the number of the dependents is 5. Loss of dependency per annum: (v) As per judgement in Smt. Sarla Verma & Ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & Anr. (2009) 4 MLJ (SC) 997 , 1/4 has to be deducted as the personal and living expenses of the deceased. Therefore, the balance Rs.1,00,800/- is considered to be the contribution to the dependent family per annum. Multiplier and total loss of dependency : (vi) So far as multiplier is concerned, as per the judgement in Smt. Sarla 8 Verma & Ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & Anr. (2009) 4 MLJ (SC) 997 , the multiplier will be 18. Therefore, the total loss of dependency would be Rs.18,14,400/- (Rs.1,00,800 x 18). Loss of Consortium: (vii) As per the Judgment of Hon’ble Apex court passed in SLP (civil) 25590/2014 Dated 31.10.17 between National Ins. Co. Ltd., ..Vs.. Pranay Sethi and others, the 1st Petitioner being the wife of the deceased is entitled to Rs.40,000/- under the head of loss of consortium. Loss of Love and Affection : (viii) Next, we have to determine the compensation for the loss of love and affection. Hence this Tribunal decides that the minor Petitioners 2 and 3 have lost their father and the 4th and 5th petitioners have lost their son and hence they are entitled for the loss of love and affection of the deceased. Hence this Tribunal decides that the petitioners 2 to 5 are entitled for Rs.1,00,000/- under the head of loss of love and affection. Medical Expenses: (ix)The petitioners have filed medical bills of Rs.5,787/-for the treatment taken by the deceased which is marked as Ex.P.6. On perusal of the said bills it is seen that the bills are genuine and not bogus and the 2nd respondent has made any serious objections for the said bills. Hence Rs. 5,787/- rounded to Rs.5,790/- is awarded for medical expenses . 9 Loss of Estate: (x) Following the Judgment of Hon’ble Apex court passed in SLP (civil) 25590/2014 Dated 31.10.17 between National Ins.

Funeral Expenses: (xii) Following the Judgment of Hon’ble Apex court passed in SLP (civil) 25590/2014 Dated 31.10.17 between National Ins. Co. Ltd., ..Vs.. Pranay Sethi and others, the Petitioners are entitled to Rs.15,000/- under the head of ""Funeral expenses"". (xiii) CALCULATION: 1. Total loss of dependency :Rs. 18,14,400/- 2.

The Points : 1.Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the respondent ? 2.Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 3rd petitioner examined as PW1 and Mr. Shabbir examined as PW2. Ex.P1 to Ex.P4 marked on the side of the Petitioners. No oral and documentary evidence were let in on the side of the respondent. POINT NO.1: 6. It is admitted fact that the Respondent is the owner of the bus bearing Reg.No. TN-23-N-1649 and Mr. Radhakrishnan was the driving the accident bus at the time of 3 accident. The petitioners contended the accident was happened only due to rash and negligent driving of the respondent's driver. But, the Respondent contended the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler by the deceased. The M.V.I inspected the offending bus and issued Ex.P.4 vehicle inspection report and wherein it is mentioned the tyre condition was satisfactory and the breaking system was in order and there was no mechanical defect in the vehicle. Since there was no mechanical defect in the Respondent's vehicle, we have to decide whether the Respondent's driver was responsible for the accident. 7. The 3rd petitioner is the daughter of the deceased and examined as P.W.1 and she deposed that on 19.10.2015 at about 2.00 P.M., while her father was riding the motor cycle bearing Reg.No. TN-23-AA-5416, on the left side of the road on Vellore to Bangalore road, opposite to Krishna Theatre, near Railway bridge, the Government bus bearing Reg.No. TN-23-N-1649, driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and dashed the deceased riding motor cycle and as a result, the deceased sustained grievous injury and immediately he was admitted in Government Hospital at Vellore and subsequently he was died. The P.W.1 not seen the accident and hence her evidence is not sufficient to prove the accident. 8. The P.W.2 examined as occurrence witness. The P.W.2 deposed he was running old iron scrap shop at the opposite of the Krishna Theatre and that on 19.10.2015 at about 2.00 P.M., while he was standing on the extreme side of the road for proceeding to his house, and when the deceased was riding the motor cycle bearing Reg.No. TN-23-AA- 5416, on the left side of the road in a careful manner, the Government bus bearing Reg.No. TN-23-N-1649, driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and dashed the deceased riding motor cycle and then run over the body and as a result, the deceased sustained grievous injury on his head and stomach and immediately he was admitted in Government Hospital at Vellore and subsequently he was died. The accident was reported to Vellore North P olice on the complaint lodged by PW2 and they have registered a case in Cr. No.636/2015, u/s. 279, 304(A) of IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P1 and wherein it was stated the Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and sustained injuries. 9. The Respondent's driver was the best person to depose about the manner of accident. The Respondent has not put his driver stepped into the witness box to state as 4 to how accident occurred and to depose that he was not at fault and was not driving the vehicle in rash and negligent manner. On the other hand the careful perusal of P.W.2 evidence and Ex.P1 FIR, Ex.P4 MVI Report, it is proved the accident was occurred only due to rash and negligent driving of Respondent's driver . Hence, it is decided the accident was occurred only due to rash and negligent driving of Respondent's driver. Accordingly, this point is answered Point No.2: 10. The 1st petitioner is the wife and 2 to 4 petitioners are daughters and 5th petitioner is mother of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.3 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein the doctor opined that the deceased was died of shock and haemorrhage due to multiple injuries. 11. It is already decided the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of Respondent's driver. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in the accident. Hence, the Respondent is liable to pay compensation to the claimants. HELMET 12. The Respondent counsel argued the deceased not wear the helmet at the time of accident and hence there was violation of MV. Rules by the deceased and hence the claimants not entitled for compensation. The Doctor opined in Ex.P.2 postmortem certificate that the death was due to multiple injuries. Even though the Respondent pleaded in counter about the non wearing of helmet by the deceased, there was no cross examination before the P.W.1 & 2 in this regard. Considering the deceased was died due to multiple injuries, if at all the deceased wear helmet, it could not save his life. AGE 13. The claimants not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of deceased person. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 39 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report also the approximate age of deceased was recorded as 39 years. Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximate age recorded in Ex.P.2 Postmortem report treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 39 years at the time of accident. 5 INCOME 14. The petitioners claimed Rs.50,00,000/- as compensation. The PW1 deposed that the deceased was lorry load man at the time of the accident and earned Rs. 16,000/- per month and it was not corroborated with documentary proof. The socio-economic condition forced to any individual to earn at the rate of Rs.300/- per day for his living. In the ruling reported in Managing Director, TNSTC vs Thahira & 3 others, 2016 (2) TNMAC 611, it is held the notional income fixed by tribunal at Rs. 9,000/- was not excessive. Considering the above legal position , this Tribunal has fixed the monthly income of deceased person as Rs.9,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 15. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. Recently in a ruling reported in in Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (2) TNMAC 55(SC): 2013 (9) SCC 54 , it was decided future prospects applicable in a case of self-employed persons also. The annual income of the deceased was Rs.9,000x12 = Rs. 1,08,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased was 39 years at the time of accident, 50% of income added towards future prospects and the monthly income arrived to Rs. 9,000 + 4,500 = 13,500/-. Deductions: 16. The deceased was married person at the time of accident. There are 5 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/4th of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/4th deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs.13,500 – 3375 - 10,125/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 17. Considering the age of the deceased is 39 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 15 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore the compensation calculated to Rs.10125x12x15=Rs.18,22,500/- 6 and therefore the petitioners are entitled Rs. 18,22,500/- as compensation towards loss of income. 18. That apart, this Tribunal awarded Rs. 50,000/- towards loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner and Rs.10,000/- is awarded to each of the petitioners 1 to 5 and in total Rs.50,000/- awarded towards love and affection and Rs. 15,000/- is awarded towards funeral expenses and Rs.5,000/- towards transport expenses. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 18,22,500.00 2.Loss of consortium ...Rs. 50,000.00 3.Funeral Expenses ...Rs. 15,000.00 4.Love and affection ...Rs. 50,000.00 5.Transport expenses ...Rs. 5,000.00 ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 19,42,500.00 ------------------------ 19. In the result, this petition is partly allowed with costs and the petitioners are entitled for Rs.19,42,500/- (Rupees Nineteen Lakhs Forty-two Thousand and five hundred only) as compensation . The respondent is directed to pay and deposit the award amount into this court within 4 weeks from this day with interest at 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this petition (30.11.2015) till the date of deposit, excluding the period of default if any.

Natarajan, B.Sc., B.L., I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Vellore. Thursday, the 20th day of April, 2017. M.C.O.P.No. 539/2015 1. Kuppu 2. Raman .. Petitioners. /Vs/ 1. Mr. S. Samraj 2. Mr. Mohamed Yaboob 3. United India Insurance Co. Ltd., .. Respondents. This petition, coming up for final hearing before me, on 5.4.2017, in the presence of Thiru. S. Suresh Kannan, Advocate for the Petitioners and Mrs. M. Shamsath Hasini Begam, counsel for the 3rd respondent and the 1st and 2nd Respondents remained absent and set exparte and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court doth delivereth the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec. 166(A) of MV Act. 3. Name of deceased Person : R. Parthiban, 4. Age of the person dead : 25 years 5. Occupation : Centring & Mason Worker 6. Income pleaded : Rs.15,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 13.4.2015 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.20,00,000/- 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the parents of the deceased Parthiban who died in road accident. That on 13.4.2015 at about 9.30 P.M, while the deceased was riding two wheeler at extreme left side of the road on Chennai to Bangalore road, near Mottur petrol bunk, the Tractor bearing Reg.No. TN-23- 2 AM-0166, owned by the 2nd respondent attached with Trailer bearing Reg.No. TN-23-AB- 1847 was driven by 1st Respondent in a rash and negligent manner without blowing horn and dashed behind the two wheeler ride by the deceased and as a result of the accident and the deceased sustained fatal injuries and died on the spot. The accident was reported to Virinjipuram P olice and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 143/2015, u/s. 279 & 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and working as centering and mason worker at Chennai and earned Rs. 15,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs.20,00,000/- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 3rd RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. The relationship of the claimants with the deceased and right to claim compensation was denied. The allegation that the 1st Respondent drove the tractor with Trailer in rash and negligent manner and caused the accident was denied. But the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent riding of the two wheeler by the deceased and dashed on the rear side of Trailer. The Trailer not insured with the 2nd Respondent and hence this Respondent is not liable to pay the compensation amount. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent ? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner examined as PW1 and Buvaneswari examined as PW2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P4 marked on the side of the Petitioners. Mr. Ragupathy, the Administrative officer of 2nd Respondent and the 1st Respondent were examined as RW1 and RW2 and Ex.R1 marked. POINT NO.1: 6. It is admitted fact the 1st Respondent is the owner of the Tractor bearing Reg.No. TN-23-AM-0166 and 2nd Respondent is the owner of the Trailer bearing Reg.No. TN-23- AB-1847. It is also admitted fact the 1st Respondent attached the Trailer with the Tractor and drive at the time of accident. It is the case of petitioners that when the deceased was 3 riding his two wheeler at extreme left side of the road, the 1st Respondent drive the Tractor and Trailer in rash and negligent manner and dashed at the back side of the deceased and due to strong hit the deceased sustained injuries and died on the spot. But, the 3rd Respondent contended the 1st Respondent drive both the vehicles in slow and careful manner and the deceased was ride the two wheeler in a rash and negligent manner and dashed on the rear side of the Trailer. The Tractor and Trailer was inspected by the MVI, and issued the Ex.P.4 M.V.I.report stating the accident was occurred not due to mechanical defect. In this case the accident was admitted and the manner of accident alone disputed. Since, there was no mechanical defect in both the vehicle and the 3rd Respondent denied the manner of accident, irrespective of whether criminal prosecution launched or not and its result, the claimants has to prove the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent independently before this Tribunal. So, we have to decide whether the claimants have proved the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent and the 3rd Respondent has proved the allegation that the deceased dashed on rear side of Trailer. 7. It is also settled law that the term rashness and negligence has to be construed lightly while making a decision on a petition for claim for the same as compared to the word rashness and negligence as mention in the Indian Penal Code . This is because the chapter in the Motor Vehicle Act dealing with compensation is a benevolent legislation and not a penal one. Minding this legal principle we have to consider whether the claimants have proved the negligence of the 1st Respondent's driver. The P.W.1 deposed that on 13.4.2015 at about 9.30 P.M, while the deceased was riding two wheeler at extreme left side of the road on Chennai to Bangalore road, near Mottur petrol bunk, the Tractor bearing Regn.No. TN-23-AM-0166 attached with Trailer bearing Reg.No. TN-23-AB-1847 was driven by 1st Respondent in a rash and negligent manner without blowing horn and dashed behind the two wheeler ride by the deceased and as a result of the accident the deceased sustained head injuries and died on the spot. The P.W.1 not seen the accident directly and hence the P.W. 1 evidence is not sufficient to prove the manner of accident. 8. The P.W. 2 examined as occurrence witness. The P.W. 2 is the own daughter of the petitioners. The P.W. 2 deposed that on 13.4.2015 at about 9.30 P.M, while the deceased was riding two wheeler at extreme left side of the road on Chennai to Bangalore road, near Mottur petrol bunk and she and her husband followed him and at that time the Tractor bearing Regn.No. TN-23-AM-0166 attached with Trailer bearing Reg.No. TN-23- AB-1847 was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner without blowing horn and 4 dashed behind the two wheeler ride by the deceased and as a result of the accident and the deceased sustained fatal injuries and died on the spot. 9. The 3rd Respondent contended that the P.W.2 not seen the accident directly and gave false evidence in order to get compensation. The 1st petitioner lodged complaint to Virinjipuram police station and they have registered a case in Cr.No. 143/2015 u/s 279 & 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1. The 1st petitioner stated in the complaint that the P.W. 2 went to accident spot and then informed about the death of their son. The 1st petitioner not stated the P.W. 2 seen the accident directly. The 3rd Respondent contended that the police has filed final report stating the deceased dashed on the rear side of the Trailer. The petitioners not produced the copy of charge sheet to prove the manner of accident. The careful perusal of P.W.2 evidence and Ex.P.1 FIR, it is very clear the P.W. 2 not seen the accident directly and hence the P.W. 2 evidence has no trust worthy to prove the manner of accident. 10. The R.W.1 is the Administrative officer of the 3rd Respondent and deposed that the deceased ride the two wheeler in a rash and negligent manner and dashed on the rear side of Trailer. The 1st Respondent examined as R.W.2 and deposed that he drove the Tractor and Trailer in slow and careful manner, but the deceased ride the two wheeler in a rash and negligent manner and dashed behind the Trailer. The Ex.P.4 is the MVI report for the Tractor and Trailer and wherein at column No.12, damages mentioned as rear right side number plate dented in Trailer. If really the tractor dashed behind the two wheeler of the deceased, certainly some damages to be occurred on front side of the Tractor. But, no damage in Tractor was noted in Ex.P.4 vehicle inspection report. The MVI report of two wheeler is relevant and important document and the petitioners not produced the same. If really, the Trailer was dashed behind the two wheeler , certainly there must some damages on the back side of the two wheeler. If the accident occurred as stated by the 3rd Respondent and R.W. 2 the two wheeler was dashed behind the Trailer, there must be some damages on the front side of the two wheeler. The petitioners wantonly suppressed the MVI report of the two wheeler and hence this Tribunal draw adverse inference that the MVI report for the two wheeler is unfavorable to the petitioners and so that it was not marked. The careful perusal of R.W. 2 evidence proved the deceased ride the two wheeler in rash and negligent manner and dashed on the rear side of Trailer. Hence, it is decided the accident was occurred only due to rash and negligent driving riding of two wheeler by the deceased. 5 Point No.2: 11. The petitioners are the parents of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.3 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein the Doctor noted the following External Injuries:- 1. Contused abrasions both upper limbs, left side of chest, 2. Lacerations left leg 3. Lacerations back of scalp The Doctor also noted the following Internal Injuries:- 1. Sub-scalpal contusion in the back. 2. Fracture vault of skull 3. Right frontal bone subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage back of both cerebral hemispheres. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries. 12. It is already decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler by the deceased. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in accident. The first Respondent is the owner of the Tractor and insured with the 3rd Respondent and the insurance was in force on the date of accident and this fact was proved through Ex.R.1 copy of Insurance Policy certificate. The 2nd Respondent is the owner of the Trailer and it was not insured with the 3rd Respondent. The 3rd Respondent contended the accident was occurred due to the rash and negligen t act of the deceased and hence the claimants not entitled for the compensation. Since, it is already decided the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler by the deceased, it is decided the claimants not entitled for compensation. 13. In the result, this petition is dismissed without cost. The petitioners are directed to pay the deficit court fees within Ten days.

The R.W.1 is the Administrative officer of the 3rd Respondent and deposed that the deceased ride the two wheeler in a rash and negligent manner and dashed on the rear side of Trailer. The 1st Respondent examined as R.W.2 and deposed that he drove the Tractor and Trailer in slow and careful manner, but the deceased ride the two wheeler in a rash and negligent manner and dashed behind the Trailer. The Ex.P.4 is the MVI report for the Tractor and Trailer and wherein at column No.12, damages mentioned as rear right side number plate dented in Trailer. If really the tractor dashed behind the two wheeler of the deceased, certainly some damages to be occurred on front side of the Tractor. But, no damage in Tractor was noted in Ex.P.4 vehicle inspection report. The MVI report of two wheeler is relevant and important document and the petitioners not produced the same. If really, the Trailer was dashed behind the two wheeler , certainly there must some damages on the back side of the two wheeler. If the accident occurred as stated by the 3rd Respondent and R.W. 2 the two wheeler was dashed behind the Trailer, there must be some damages on the front side of the two wheeler. The petitioners wantonly suppressed the MVI report of the two wheeler and hence this Tribunal draw adverse inference that the MVI report for the two wheeler is unfavorable to the petitioners and so that it was not marked. The careful perusal of R.W. 2 evidence proved the deceased ride the two wheeler in rash and negligent manner and dashed on the rear side of Trailer. Hence, it is decided the accident was occurred only due to rash and negligent driving riding of two wheeler by the deceased. 5 Point No.2: 11. The petitioners are the parents of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.3 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein the Doctor noted the following External Injuries:- 1. Contused abrasions both upper limbs, left side of chest, 2. Lacerations left leg 3. Lacerations back of scalp The Doctor also noted the following Internal Injuries:- 1. Sub-scalpal contusion in the back. 2. Fracture vault of skull 3. Right frontal bone subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage back of both cerebral hemispheres. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries. 12. It is already decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler by the deceased. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in accident. The first Respondent is the owner of the Tractor and insured with the 3rd Respondent and the insurance was in force on the date of accident and this fact was proved through Ex.R.1 copy of Insurance Policy certificate. The 2nd Respondent is the owner of the Trailer and it was not insured with the 3rd Respondent. The 3rd Respondent contended the accident was occurred due to the rash and negligen t act of the deceased and hence the claimants not entitled for the compensation. Since, it is already decided the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler by the deceased, it is decided the claimants not entitled for compensation. 13. In the result, this petition is dismissed without cost. The petitioners are directed to pay the deficit court fees within Ten days.

5rlvflkps77kv2djpfn1hnaek0 (17).pdf,"1 BEFORE THE MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, VELLORE, VELLORE DISTRICT. (I ADDITIONAL DISTRICT AND SESSIONS COURT, VELLORE.) Present: Thiru S. Natarajan, B.Sc., B.L., I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Vellore. Thursday, the 20th day of April, 2017. M.C.O.P.No. 539/2015 1. Kuppu 2. Raman .. Petitioners. /Vs/ 1. Mr. S. Samraj 2. Mr. Mohamed Yaboob 3. United India Insurance Co. Ltd., .. Respondents. This petition, coming up for final hearing before me, on 5.4.2017, in the presence of Thiru. S. Suresh Kannan, Advocate for the Petitioners and Mrs. M. Shamsath Hasini Begam, counsel for the 3rd respondent and the 1st and 2nd Respondents remained absent and set exparte and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court doth delivereth the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec. 166(A) of MV Act. 3. Name of deceased Person : R. Parthiban, 4. Age of the person dead : 25 years 5. Occupation : Centring & Mason Worker 6. Income pleaded : Rs.15,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 13.4.2015 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.20,00,000/- 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the parents of the deceased Parthiban who died in road accident. That on 13.4.2015 at about 9.30 P.M, while the deceased was riding two wheeler at extreme left side of the road on Chennai to Bangalore road, near Mottur petrol bunk, the Tractor bearing Reg.No. TN-23- 2 AM-0166, owned by the 2nd respondent attached with Trailer bearing Reg.No. TN-23-AB- 1847 was driven by 1st Respondent in a rash and negligent manner without blowing horn and dashed behind the two wheeler ride by the deceased and as a result of the accident and the deceased sustained fatal injuries and died on the spot. The accident was reported to Virinjipuram P olice and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 143/2015, u/s. 279 & 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and working as centering and mason worker at Chennai and earned Rs. 15,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs.20,00,000/- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 3rd RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. The relationship of the claimants with the deceased and right to claim compensation was denied. The allegation that the 1st Respondent drove the tractor with Trailer in rash and negligent manner and caused the accident was denied. But the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent riding of the two wheeler by the deceased and dashed on the rear side of Trailer. The Trailer not insured with the 2nd Respondent and hence this Respondent is not liable to pay the compensation amount. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent ? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner examined as PW1 and Buvaneswari examined as PW2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P4 marked on the side of the Petitioners. Mr. Ragupathy, the Administrative officer of 2nd Respondent and the 1st Respondent were examined as RW1 and RW2 and Ex.R1 marked. POINT NO.1: 6. It is admitted fact the 1st Respondent is the owner of the Tractor bearing Reg.No. TN-23-AM-0166 and 2nd Respondent is the owner of the Trailer bearing Reg.No. TN-23- AB-1847. It is also admitted fact the 1st Respondent attached the Trailer with the Tractor and drive at the time of accident. It is the case of petitioners that when the deceased was 3 riding his two wheeler at extreme left side of the road, the 1st Respondent drive the Tractor and Trailer in rash and negligent manner and dashed at the back side of the deceased and due to strong hit the deceased sustained injuries and died on the spot. But, the 3rd Respondent contended the 1st Respondent drive both the vehicles in slow and careful manner and the deceased was ride the two wheeler in a rash and negligent manner and dashed on the rear side of the Trailer. The Tractor and Trailer was inspected by the MVI, and issued the Ex.P.4 M.V.I.report stating the accident was occurred not due to mechanical defect. In this case the accident was admitted and the manner of accident alone disputed. Since, there was no mechanical defect in both the vehicle and the 3rd Respondent denied the manner of accident, irrespective of whether criminal prosecution launched or not and its result, the claimants has to prove the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent independently before this Tribunal. So, we have to decide whether the claimants have proved the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent and the 3rd Respondent has proved the allegation that the deceased dashed on rear side of Trailer. 7. It is also settled law that the term rashness and negligence has to be construed lightly while making a decision on a petition for claim for the same as compared to the word rashness and negligence as mention in the Indian Penal Code . This is because the chapter in the Motor Vehicle Act dealing with compensation is a benevolent legislation and not a penal one. Minding this legal principle we have to consider whether the claimants have proved the negligence of the 1st Respondent's driver. The P.W.1 deposed that on 13.4.2015 at about 9.30 P.M, while the deceased was riding two wheeler at extreme left side of the road on Chennai to Bangalore road, near Mottur petrol bunk, the Tractor bearing Regn.No. TN-23-AM-0166 attached with Trailer bearing Reg.No. TN-23-AB-1847 was driven by 1st Respondent in a rash and negligent manner without blowing horn and dashed behind the two wheeler ride by the deceased and as a result of the accident the deceased sustained head injuries and died on the spot. The P.W.1 not seen the accident directly and hence the P.W. 1 evidence is not sufficient to prove the manner of accident. 8. The P.W. 2 examined as occurrence witness. The P.W. 2 is the own daughter of the petitioners. The P.W. 2 deposed that on 13.4.2015 at about 9.30 P.M, while the deceased was riding two wheeler at extreme left side of the road on Chennai to Bangalore road, near Mottur petrol bunk and she and her husband followed him and at that time the Tractor bearing Regn.No. TN-23-AM-0166 attached with Trailer bearing Reg.No. TN-23- AB-1847 was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner without blowing horn and 4 dashed behind the two wheeler ride by the deceased and as a result of the accident and the deceased sustained fatal injuries and died on the spot. 9. The 3rd Respondent contended that the P.W.2 not seen the accident directly and gave false evidence in order to get compensation. The 1st petitioner lodged complaint to Virinjipuram police station and they have registered a case in Cr.No. 143/2015 u/s 279 & 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1. The 1st petitioner stated in the complaint that the P.W. 2 went to accident spot and then informed about the death of their son. The 1st petitioner not stated the P.W. 2 seen the accident directly. The 3rd Respondent contended that the police has filed final report stating the deceased dashed on the rear side of the Trailer. The petitioners not produced the copy of charge sheet to prove the manner of accident. The careful perusal of P.W.2 evidence and Ex.P.1 FIR, it is very clear the P.W. 2 not seen the accident directly and hence the P.W. 2 evidence has no trust worthy to prove the manner of accident. 10. The R.W.1 is the Administrative officer of the 3rd Respondent and deposed that the deceased ride the two wheeler in a rash and negligent manner and dashed on the rear side of Trailer. The 1st Respondent examined as R.W.2 and deposed that he drove the Tractor and Trailer in slow and careful manner, but the deceased ride the two wheeler in a rash and negligent manner and dashed behind the Trailer. The Ex.P.4 is the MVI report for the Tractor and Trailer and wherein at column No.12, damages mentioned as rear right side number plate dented in Trailer. If really the tractor dashed behind the two wheeler of the deceased, certainly some damages to be occurred on front side of the Tractor. But, no damage in Tractor was noted in Ex.P.4 vehicle inspection report. The MVI report of two wheeler is relevant and important document and the petitioners not produced the same. If really, the Trailer was dashed behind the two wheeler , certainly there must some damages on the back side of the two wheeler. If the accident occurred as stated by the 3rd Respondent and R.W. 2 the two wheeler was dashed behind the Trailer, there must be some damages on the front side of the two wheeler. The petitioners wantonly suppressed the MVI report of the two wheeler and hence this Tribunal draw adverse inference that the MVI report for the two wheeler is unfavorable to the petitioners and so that it was not marked. The careful perusal of R.W. 2 evidence proved the deceased ride the two wheeler in rash and negligent manner and dashed on the rear side of Trailer. Hence, it is decided the accident was occurred only due to rash and negligent driving riding of two wheeler by the deceased. 5 Point No.2: 11. The petitioners are the parents of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.3 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein the Doctor noted the following External Injuries:- 1. Contused abrasions both upper limbs, left side of chest, 2. Lacerations left leg 3. Lacerations back of scalp The Doctor also noted the following Internal Injuries:- 1. Sub-scalpal contusion in the back. 2. Fracture vault of skull 3. Right frontal bone subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage back of both cerebral hemispheres. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries. 12. It is already decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler by the deceased. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in accident. The first Respondent is the owner of the Tractor and insured with the 3rd Respondent and the insurance was in force on the date of accident and this fact was proved through Ex.R.1 copy of Insurance Policy certificate. The 2nd Respondent is the owner of the Trailer and it was not insured with the 3rd Respondent. The 3rd Respondent contended the accident was occurred due to the rash and negligen t act of the deceased and hence the claimants not entitled for the compensation. Since, it is already decided the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler by the deceased, it is decided the claimants not entitled for compensation. 13. In the result, this petition is dismissed without cost. The petitioners are directed to pay the deficit court fees within Ten days.

The rider and pillion rider namely Nadeem Mohamed and S.P. Ganesh sustained fatal injuries and died on the spot. The Gudipala police have registered a case in crime No.72/2015 , u/s. 279, 337, 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy, and completed B.Com., in VIT University and also taking part-time tuition for +2 commerce and Accountancy students through which he earned Rs.25,000/- per month. The petitioners are fully depending upon the income of the deceased. Due to the sudden demise of the deceased, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs.1,00,00,000/- as compensation for the death of their son. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER AND ADDITIONAL COUNTER FOR 2nd RESPONDENT:- The petition is not sustainable either in law and on facts. The respondent did not admit any of the allegation made in the petition except those that are specifically admitted. The vehicle involved in the accident has not been insured with this respondent company. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. The accident was occurred collusion of two vehicles. Due to rash and negligent driving of the two wheeler only the accident occurred. The age, income, occupation of the deceased are denied. The manner of accident not admitted. The rider of the two wheeler was not having valid driving license at the time of accident. The two wheeler has no insurance policy at the time of the accident. The Mahindra Maxi cab bearing Reg.AP-03-TE-0349 had been sent to MV Inspection only on 18.09.2015 with a delay of 5 days. Hence the petition might be dismissed with costs. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent ? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 3 5. The 2nd petitioner examined as PW1 and Mr. John Soosai examined as PW2. Ex.P1 to Ex.P10 marked on the side of the Petitioners. No oral and documentary evidence were let in on the side of the respondents. The 2nd respondent has filed a petition in IA No. 6/2018 u/s 170 M.V. Act and the same was allowed on 05.01.2018. POINT NO.1: 6. It is admitted fact the 1st Respondent is the owner of the Maxi Cab bearing Reg.No. AP-03-TE-0349 which involved in the accident and Mr. Siva Prasad was driving the offending vehicle at the time of accident. It is the case of petitioners that on 13.09.2015 at about 18.00 Hours, in the Chittoor to Vellore road, Chennai Main road, near Mopathi Kannigapuram Cross, Gudipala Mandalam, Adhara Pradesh, while the deceased was travelling as a pillion rider in CB Unicorn Motor Cycle, bearing Reg.No. TN-23-AM-6547 ridden by his friend Nadeem Mohamed, a Maxi Cab bearing Reg.No. AP-03-TE-0349, driven by its driver, proceeding from Vellore to Chittoor, in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the Motor cycle and as a result, the rider and pillion rider namely Nadeem Mohamed and S.P. Ganesh sustained fatal injuries and died on the spot. But, the 2nd Respondent contended the accident was happened due to the negligence of the rider of the two wheeler. In this case accident was admitted. But manner of accident alone disputed. The offending vehicle was inspected by the MVI and issued the Ex.P4 M.V.I. report stating that there was no mechanical defect in the offending vehicle. Since, the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident, irrespective of whether criminal prosecution launched or not and irrespective of its result, the claimants have to prove the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver independently before this Tribunal. So, we have to decide whether the claimants have proved the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's rider. 7. The P.W.1 deposed that the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent riding of the 1st respondent driver. The P.W.1 not seen the accident directly. The P.W.2 examined as occurrence witness and he deposed that on 13.09.2015 at about 6.00 P.M., while he was travelling in his car from Chittoor to Vellore and the deceased was travelling as a pillion rider in the Motor Cycle, bearing Reg.No. TN-23-AM-6547 ridden by his friend Nadeem Mohamed, at that time a Maxi Cab bearing Reg.No. AP-03-TE-0349, driven by its driver, from north to south direction, in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the Unicorn Motor cycle in which the deceased had travelled and as a 4 result, the deceased as well as the rider of the two wheeler sustained fatal injuries and died on the spot. 8. The complaint was lodged by one Aditya Dinesh before Gudipala Police station and they have registered a case in Cr.No. 72/2015 u/s 304(A) of IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and wherein also it is stated that the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent driver. The xerox copy of the complaint is marked as Ex.P2. The counsel for the 2nd respondent argued that the rider of the two wheeler alone is responsible for the accident due to his own negligence. The 1st Respondent's driver was the best person to depose about the manner of accident. The 2nd Respondent has not put the 1st Respondent's driver into the witness box to state as to how accident occurred and to depose that he was not at fault and was not driving the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner or the accident was occurred only due to the negligence of the deceased. On the other hand the careful perusal of P.W.2 evidence and Ex.P1 FIR, Ex.P2 Complaint and Ex.P5 MVI Report, it is proved the accident was occurred only due to rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver . Hence, it is decided the accident was occurred only due to rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver. Point No.2: 9. It is already decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent driver. The Ex.P.3 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in accident. The first Respondent is the owner of the offending vehicle and he insured the vehicle with the 2nd Respondent and the insurance was in force on the date of accident and this fact was proved through the entries made in Ex.P4 copy of M.V.I. Report. 10. This Tribunal accepted the date of birth of deceased mentioned in Ex.P6 and P7 as correct date of birth of deceased and the age of deceased was decided to 21 years, 3 months, 21 days at the time of accident and hence the age of deceased is fixed as 21 years at the time of accident. INCOME 11. The petitioners claimed Rs.1,00,00,000/- as compensation for the death of their son. According to the petitioners, the deceased has completed B.Com., in VIT University and also taking part-time tuition for +2 commerce and Accountancy students through 5 which he earned Rs.25,000/- per month. But no document produced to prove the income from taking part-time tuition to the students. The Ex.P7 is the Transfer certificate. The Ex.P9 is the Course completion certificate and it proved the deceased has completed B.Com. (Computer Applications) Decree programme at VIT University. The counsel for the petitioner argued that the deceased has completed the decree programme in a reputed college and hence the notional income may be fixed at 20,000/- per month and in support of his argument he relied on the rulings reported in National Insurance Co. Ltd., Vs. Salma Farheen and others, 2015(2) TN MAC 341 (Del.) and wherein it was held that INCOME : Fixation of - Injured/Claimant, a student of B.A.II Year in a prestigious college and also pursuing professional course of Air Hostess - Claimant having brilliant academic record and wanted to become an Air Hostess - Non earning member - Potential income of a student pursuing professional course to be taken into consideration - Considering salary of Group ""A"" employees in Government during relevant period, held, Rs.20,000/- p.m. can be fixed as Income - Tribunal fixing Rs.15,000/- p.m., held, on lower side. In this case, the petitioners have not produced mark sheets and provisional decree certificate showing the brilliant academic record of the deceased. As per Ex.P6 Mark sheet, the deceased was an average student. At this juncture it is useful to refer the ruling of our High Court, Madras , reported in IFFCO-TOKIO, General Insurance Co.Ltd Vs K.Elammal;17-2-2015, indiankanoon.org/doc/82016826, wherein the notional income of student in different categories discussed at para 7 as follows:- 7. Though Mr.C.R.Krishnamoorthy, learned counsel appearing for the appellant would submit that the deceased was a non earning member and if at all, only Rs.30,000/- can be taken as notional income as per the judgement in Kishan Gopal & another vs. Lala & others reported in 2013 (2) TN MAC 358 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in Ashvinbhai Jayantilal Modi Vs. Ramkaran Ramchandra Sharma and another reported in 2014 ACJ 2648 in respect of a first year Medical College student, who died in an accident, determined the monthly income at Rs.25,000/-. Similarly, this Court, in United India Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Velumyil and others reported in 2013 (2) TN MAC 846, in respect of a first year B.E. student, who died in an accident, determined Rs.15,000/- as monthly income. In this case, the deceased was a II year B.Com student. Though, he cannot be equated to a Medical College student or an Engineering College student, at least Rs.6,000/- per month should be taken as monthly income and adding 50% towards future prospects, as per the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Santosh Devi's case 6 reported in (2012) 6 SCC 421, the total monthly income would be, = Rs.6000/- + 50% (Rs.6000/-) = Rs. 9000/-. In the above cited ruling notional income for B.Com., studying student was arrived to Rs. 6,000/-. Considering wide job opportunity, equal to the Engineering student, it is the view of this Tribunal, it would be justifiable in fixing the notional income of B.Com. graduate is Rs.9,000/-. As per the above ruling 50% future prospects added and the notional monthly income of deceased was arrived to Rs. 13,500/-. Deductions: 12. The petitioners are the parents of the deceased S.P. Ganesh and this fact was proved through Ex.P10 Legal Heir Certificate. The deceased was a bachelor. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/2 of the income towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/2 of the deduction (13500 – 6750 = 6750) the monthly income of the deceased arrived to Rs. 6750/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 13. Considering the age of the deceased is 21 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 18 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, the compensation calculated to Rs.6750x12x18=Rs.14,58,000/- and therefore the petitioners are entitled Rs.14,58,000/- as compensation towards loss of income. 14. The petitioners have claimed Rs.55,000/- towards funeral expenses, but not produced any document. However, a sum of Rs.15,000/- is granted towards funeral expenses. For loss of love and affection, the petitioners have claimed Rs.4,00,000/-. The petitioners are the parents of the deceased and they have lost their love & affection of the deceased. Hence, a sum of Rs.50,000/- is awarded towards love and affection. The petitioners claimed Rs. 50,000/- towards damages to clothing and articles, but they have not produced any documents. However, Rs.2,000/- is awarded towards damages to clothes and articles. The petitioners claimed Rs.50,000/- towards transport to hospital, but not produced any document. However, considering the deceased was died on the spot and his body was taken to his native place, Rs.10,000/- is awarded towards transport expenses. The petitioners claimed Rs.2,00,000/- towards mental shock and agony and 7 Rs.2,00,000/- towards loss of expectation of life and Rs.2,75,000/- towards loss of estate.

Natarajan, B.Sc., B.L., I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Vellore. Monday, the 3rd day of April, 2017. M.C.O.P.No. 420/2015 1. Manonmani 2. G. Lakshmi 3. G. Sivakumar .. Petitioners. /Vs/ 1. P. Santhanathan 2. The National Insurance Co. Ltd., Rep. by its Divisional Manager, Vellore. .. Respondents. This petition, coming up for final hearing before me, on 14.03.2017 in the presence of Thiru. V. Padmanaban, Advocate for the Petitioners and Thiru. L. Pandurangan, Counsel for the 2nd respondent and 1st respondent remain absent and set exparte and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court doth delivereth the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 3. Name of deceased Person : Ganesan 4. Age of the person dead : 60 years 5. Occupation : Snakes Business 6. Income pleaded : Rs.15,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 17.10.2014 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.25,00,000/- 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the wife, daughter and son of the deceased Ganesan who died in a road accident. That on 17.10.2014 at about 4.30 A.M., while the deceased was traveled in his bi-cycle at the 2 extreme side of the road from North to South direction on Arni to Vellore road, near Sankar Babu Saw Mill, the AKR Parcel service Lorry bearing Reg.No. TN-34-B-4086 was driven by its driver S. Senthilkumar in a rash and negligent manner without following the traffic rules, and dashed against the rear side of deceased Ganesan traveled bi-cycle and due to the strong hit, the deceased sustained fatal injuries and died on the way to Government Vellore Medical College and Hospital, Vellore. The accident was reported to Vellore Taluk police and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 446/2014, u/s. 279 & 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was doing snakes business and earned Rs.15,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs.25,00,000/- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR SECOND RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The date, time, place and manner of accident are not admitted. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. The valid IC., RC and driving license of the offending vehicle have also been denied. The allegation that the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in rash and negligent manner and caused the accident was denied. The respondent driver drove the vehicle at a normal speed observing all the traffic rules and it is only the deceased had crossed the road all of a sudden and hit against the lorry and sustained injuries and due to old age died on the way to hospital. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent ? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner examined as PW1 and Mr. Chidambaran examined as PW2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P6 marked on the side of the Petitioners. No oral and documentary evidence were let in on the side of the respondents. POINT NO.1 6. It is admitted fact the 1st Respondent is the owner of the offending lorry bearing Reg.No. TN-34-B-4086 which involved in the accident and Mr. Senthil kumar was the driver of the offending lorry at the time of accident. The petitioners contended the 1st 3 Respondent's driver drove the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and so that fatal injuries caused to the deceased and died on the way to hospital. But, the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident as pleaded by the petitioners and contended that the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in slow and careful manner and the accident was happened due to the negligence of the deceased. The offending vehicle was inspected by the MVI and issued the Ex.P5 M.V.I. report stating the tyre condition was satisfactory and the Breaking system was in order and there was no mechanical defect in the offending vehicle. Since, the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident as pleaded by the claimants and there was no mechanical defect in the offending vehicle, we have to decide whether the 1st Respondent's driver is responsible for the accident and there was any contributory negligence on the part of deceased. 7. The P.W.1 deposed that 17.10.2014 at about 4.30 A.M., while the deceased was traveled in his bi-cycle at the extreme side of the road from North to South direction on Arni to Vellore road, near Sankar Babu Saw Mill, the AKR Parcel service Lorry bearing Reg.No. TN-34-B-4086 was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner without following the traffic rules, and dashed against the rear side of deceased Ganesan traveled bi-cycle and due to the strong hit, the deceased sustained fatal injuries and died on the way to Government Vellore Medical College and Hospital, Vellore. The P.W.1 not seen the accident directly and hence the P.W.1 evidence is not sufficient to prove the manner of accident. 8. The P.W. 2 examined as occurrence witness and he deposed that on 17.10.2014 at about 4.30 A.M., while he was proceeding to Kaniyambadi by riding his bicycle and in the opposite direction his deceased brother came in a bicycle on the left side of the road, from North to South direction on Arni to Vellore road, near Sankar Babu Saw Mill, the AKR Parcel service Lorry bearing Reg.No. TN-34-B-4086 was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner without following the traffic rules, and dashed against the rear side of deceased Ganesan traveled bi-cycle and the wheel of the lorry ran over on the deceased body and he sustained fatal injuries and died on the way to Hospital. The accident was reported to Vellore Taluk police station and they have registered a case in Cr.No.446/2014 for offence u/s 279, 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and wherein also it was stated the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in a rash and negligent 4 manner and dashed against the deceased. After investigation the police has filed the charge sheet against the 1st Respondent driver and this fact was proved through the Ex.P6 copy of charge sheet. Hence, it is decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st Respondent's driver. POINT NO. 2 : 9. The 1st petitioner is the wife of deceased. The 2nd petitioner is the daughter and 3rd petitioner is the son and this fact was proved through Ex.P.5 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.3 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein the Doctor noted the following External Injuries:- 1. Crush injury right leg from pelvic region to the foot. 2. Crush injury on the left leg from the mid thigh level to foot. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died due to multiple injuries sustained. 10. It is already decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver. The Ex.P.3 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in the accident. The 1st Respondent insured the vehicle with the 2nd Respondent and the insurance was in force on the date of accident and this fact was proved through the entries in Ex.P.5 copy of M.V.I. Report. The 1st Respondent's driver also has valid driving license to drive the offending vehicle at the time of accident and this fact was also proved from Ex.P5 MVI Report. Hence, the Respondents are liable to pay compensation to the claimants. Hence, the 2nd Respondent is liable to pay compensation to the claimants. AGE 11. The claimants not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of deceased person. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 60 years. In Ex.P.6 Postmortem report also the age of deceased was recorded as 60 years. Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximate age recorded in Ex.P.3 Postmortem Certificate treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 60 years at the time of accident. 5 MEDICAL EXPENDITURE:- 12. Due to the accident the deceased sustained fatal injuries and died on the way to Hospital. Hence no amount was awarded for medical expenditure. PAIN AND SUFFERINGS:- 13. The deceased was died on the way to Hospital. Hence no amount was awarded under this head. INCOME 14. The petitioners claimed Rs.25,00,000/- as compensation. The P.W.1 deposed the deceased was doing snakes business at the time of accident and earned Rs.15,000/- per month. There was no evidence to show the income proof. T he socio-economic condition forced to any individual to earn at the rate of Rs.200/- per day for his living. This court also consider the citation in Sadiq and others Vs. Divisional Manager United India Insurance Co., Ltd. 2014 ACJ 627, the claimant was a vegetable vendor who met with an accident in 2008 and the Hon'ble Supreme Court assessed income at Rs.6,500/- p.m. Considering the above legal position and age of deceased , this Tribunal has fixed the monthly income of deceased person as Rs.5,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 15. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. Recently in a ruling reported in in Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (2) TNMAC 55(SC): 2013 (9) SCC 54 , it was decided fu ture prospects applicable in a case of self-employed persons also. In the present case, it was already decided that the age of the deceased is 60 years. Therefore, this tribunal has not granted any award under this head. Deductions: 16. The deceased was married person at the time of accident. There are 3 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/3rd of salary 6 towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/3rd deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs. 5000 – 1667 = Rs. 3333/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF DEPENDENCY 17. Considering the age of the deceased is 60 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 9 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, t he “loss of dependency” to the family is arrived to Rs. 3333X12x9 = Rs. 3,59,964/-. COMPENSATION FOR CONSORTIUM AND LOVE AND AFFECTION CONSORTIUM 18. In Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2009 (2) TN MAC 36 (SC) and followed in Shashikala & another -Vs- Gangalakshmamana & another , 2015 (1) TN MAC 785 (SC) it has held that “Loss of consortium is usually for loss for spouse’s affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations for future years and in such circumstances, Courts to award at least Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation for Loss of Consortium” and this position followed in Reliance General Insurance Co Ltd -Vs-K.Meena & others, 2015 (2) TNMAC 449 . The 1st petitioner is wife and aged about 55 years at the time of the accident, which is the crucial period, at which time she very needed the companionship of her husband and for which Rs.1,00,000/- is awarded. Loss of Love & affection & Mental Agony and loss of Expectancy of life : 19. In Asha Verman -Vs- Maharaj Singh, 2015(1) TN MAC 465 (SC), it is held in para 18, that each children entitled at Rs. 1,00,000/- towards love and affection and each parents are entitled at Rs. 50,000/-. The petitioners 2 and 3 are the daughter and son of the deceased and they have lost their love & affection of the deceased and it is not measurable by money. However, a small amount of Rs.1,00,000/- is considered in the lumpsum calculation towards love and affection. Funeral Expenses : 20. Decent burial is also one on the right under Art 21 of our constitution, The petitioners have failed to produce any expenditure statement relating to the funeral expenses, so the tribunal has awarded a minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- for the head, also relied the Judgment in Rajesh v. Rajbir singh [CDJ 2013 SC 485], the Hon’ble apex court has further held that “ Funeral expenses not only includes fee paid in crematorium or 7 cementary but also includes religious practices and conventions performed on death in family. Hence in absence of any evidence to contrary, minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- to be awarded by Courts towards funeral expenses ”. Hence, a sum of Rs.25,000/- alone was considered and fixed the award in lumpsum manner. Loss of Estate, Transport Expenses and damages for articles:- 21. This Tribunal not considered future prospects and hence Rs.25,000/- is awarded towards Loss of estate. The petitioners have not produced any documentary evidence showing the actual expenses for transport expenses. However, this Tribunal awarded Rs.5,000/- towards transport expenses. The petitioners not accounted for the actual damages caused in the accident. Hence, this Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs. 2,000/- towards damage to clothes and articles. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 3,59,964/- 2.Loss of consortium ...Rs. 1,00,000/- 3.Loss of Love & Affection …Rs. 1,00,000/- 4.Loss of estate ...Rs . 25,000/- 5.Medical Expenses …Rs.

Immediately they were shifted to Apollo KH Hospital, Melvisharam for treatment. On the next day, i.e., 20.04.2015 Sivakumar died in the hospital without responding to the treatment. The accident was reported before the Rathinagiri police and they have registered a case in Crime No.133/2015 u/s. 279 and 337 of IPC and then altered into 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased Sivakumar in MCOP No.460/2015 was doing Pawn Broker business and real estate business and earned Rs.50,000/- per month. The 1st petitioner, the wife of deceased Sivakumar died during the pendency of this case. The 2nd and 3rd petitioners are daughter and son of the deceased Sivakumar and the 4th 3 petitioner is the mother of the deceased Sivakumar. Due to the sudden demise of Sivakumar, his legal representatives, the petitioners have lost their dependency and their bright future is left in lurch.

Muthaiar School, Panruti and earned Rs.15,000/- per month. Due to the accident he is unable to do his profession as before. Hence, the petitioner filed this claim application claiming compensation of Rs. 20,00,000/- for the injuries sustained by him in the accident. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 1st RESPONDENT IN BOTH THE PETITONS :- These petitions are not maintainable either in law or on facts. The 1st respondent denied all the allegations made in the petition except those that are specifically admitted. The accident was occurred in the National Highways road. The driver of the Car has got valid driving licence at the time of accident. The said vehicle was insured with the 2nd respondent insurance company covered with policy No.0122033114P103031091 and valid from 02.08.2014 to 01.08.2015. Hence, he 1st respondent is not liable to pay any compensation to the petitioners. The 2nd respondent is only liable to pay the compensation to the petitioners. The amount claimed is excessive. Hence, the petition is liable to be dismissed as against the 1st respondent. 4. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 2nd RESPONDENT IN BOTH THE PETITONS :- The petition is not maintainable either in law or on facts. The 2nd respondent denied all the allegations made in the petition except those that are specifically admitted. The accident was occurred in the National Highways road. As per records maintained in the 2nd respondent the vehicle Maruti Suziki Car bearing registration No. TN 07 W 7664 involved in the accident has not been insured with the 2nd Respondent Company. There is no rashness driving of the car driver. Due to rash and negligent riding of the motorcyclist the accident occurred. Further, the accident occurred due to collision of two vehicles. These petitions are bad for non joinder of necessary party. This respondent is an unnecessary party. The petitioners are not entitled for any compensation for the own negligent act of the deceased. The first petitioner S. Kalaivani died due to illness at her father Mani's house at Panruti. The allegations regarding the age, occupation, income of the deceased Sivakumar and Petitioner Balaji are denied. 4 The petitioners in MCOP No.460/2015 have to prove that they are the dependents of the deceased. The age of the petitioners also denied. The nature of injuries alleged to have been sustained by the Petitioner Balaji is also denied. The alleged period of treatment is not admitted. The amount claimed in both the petitions is excessive. Hence, the petitions are liable to be dismissed. 4. The Points : 1.Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent ? 2.Whether the respondents are liable to compensate the petitioners? Which respondent is liable? 3.Whether the petitioners in MCOP 460/2015 are entitled for compensation? if so, how much? 4.Whether the petitioner in MCOP 461/2015 are entitled for compensation? if so, how much? 5. The 4th petitioner in MCOP No.460/2015 was examined as PW1. The petitioner in MCOP 461/2015 was examined as P.W.2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P.10 were marked on the side of the Petitioners. No oral and documentary evidence were let in on the side of the 2nd respondent. The 2nd respondent has filed petitions in IA No. 239/2018 in MCOP 460/2015 and in IA No. 240/2018 in MCOP 461/2015 u/s 170 M.V. Act and the same were allowed on 27.02.2018. POINT NOS.1 & 2: 6. It is the case of the petitioners that on 19.04.2015 at about 10.00 hours, the deceased Sivakumar in MCOP 460/2015 was riding in his two wheeler along with his relative, namely, Balaji (Petitioner in MCOP 461/2015) as a pillion rider on Chennai to Vellore National Highways road to go to Rathinagiri Temple and while he was proceeding opposite to Arapakkam TATA Motors Company, a Maruthi Suzuki Car bearing Registration No TN-07-W-7664, belongs to the 1st respondent, driven by its driver came in a rash ad negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler ridden by Sivakumar and as a result of which, both the rider and pillion rider fell down and sustained grievous injuries all over the body and subsequently, on 20.04.2015 the said Sivakumar died in the Apollo KH hospital, Melvisharam. Since the 1st petitioner in MCOP 460/2015 who was the wife of the 5 deceased Sivakumar died during pendency of the case, the 4th petitioner, who is the mother of the deceased was examined as P.W.1. She has narrated the manner of accident in her evidence as averred in both the petitions. She has admitted in the cross examination that she has not seen the accident. Through P.W.1, the attested xerox copy of F.I.R., was marked as Ex.P1 in which it is seen that regarding the accident, a criminal case was registered by Rathinagiri Police on 19.04.2015 at about 14.00 hours based on the complaint statement given by Balaji who is the petitioner in MCOP No.461/2015 as against the car driver Gautham S/o G. Elango u/s 279 and 337 of IPC., The contents of F.I.R., reflected the petitioners' allegations regarding the manner of accident. Ex.P2 is the xerox copy of Postmortem Certificate. The Motor Vehicle Inspector's Report is marked as Ex.P3 which reveals that this accident was not due to any mechanical defects of the vehicle which would in turn mean that the accident was caused only by the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the car. The petitioners in both the petitions have stated that the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the car owned by the 1st respondent was the main cause for the accident. The petitioners have filed Ex.P6 xerox copy of Insurance Policy to show that the car bearing registration No. TN 07 W 7664 was insured with the 2nd respondent and the insurance policy was in force at the time of accident. 7. The accident was not denied by the respondents 1 and 2. Further they have admitted in their counters that the rider as well as the pillion rider of the two wheeler bearing registration No.TN 23 BC 5727 have sustained injuries in the accident. It is the 1st respondent's contention that as per Ex.P6, the 2nd respondent is liable to compensate the petitioners in both the petitions. On the other hand, the 2nd respondent has contended that the accident occurred due to collision of two nos. of motor vehicles and that the accident took place only due to the fault of the rider of the two wheeler, namely, deceased Sivakumar and therefore, the petitioners are not entitled to get compensation from the 2nd respondent. There is no evidence on record on the side of the 2nd respondent to fix the responsibility for the accident on the part of the deceased Sivakumar who has ridden the two wheeler at the time of accident. Balaji, the petitioner in MCOP 461/2015 has examined himself as P.W.2 and stated in his evidence that on 19.04.2015 at 10.00 A.M., he was riding on pillion in the Hero Passion Pro two wheeler bearing registration No. TN 23 BC 5747 which was ridden by his uncle Sivakumar to go to Rathinagiri temple and that while they were proceeding opposite to TATA Motors Company at Arapakkam, the Maruti Suzuki Car - TN 07 W 7664 came in the same direction and dashed against the two 6 wheeler and that Rathinagiri Police have registered a case against the driver of the car. P.W.2 is the occurrence witness in this case. So, from the evidence of P.W.1 and 2 and from Ex.P1 and P3, the petitioners have proved that the accident was occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st respondent's car driver. Hence, it is held that the 1st Respondent's car driver has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused accident. The 1st respondent is vicariously liable for the negligent act of his driver. As the insurer of the offending vehicle as per Ex.P6, the 2nd respondent is liable to pay compensation to the petitioners in both the petitions and these points are answered accordingly. POINT NO.3 :- (MCOP NO. 460/2015) 8. The 1st petitioner is the wife and 2 and 3 minor petitioners are daughter and son and 4th petitioner is mother of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.4 legal heir certificate. During the pendency of this case, it was reported that the 1st petitioner died and the main petition was amended suitably as per order in I.A. 36/2017, dated 10.01.2016. Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein the doctor opined that the deceased was died of shock and haemorrhage due to head injury. AGE 9. The claimants have not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of deceased person. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 38 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report also the approximate age of deceased was recorded as 38 years. Considering that there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximate age recorded in Ex.P.2 Postmortem report is treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 38 years at the time of accident. INCOME 10. The petitioners claimed Rs.50,00,000/- as compensation. PW1 deposed that the deceased was a pawn broker and also he was doing real estate business at the time of the accident and earned Rs. 50,000/- per month. The petitioners have filed Ex.P5 xerox copy of Pawn Broker licence of the deceased to show the occupation of the deceased. But no income proof is filed. The socio-economic condition forced to any individual to earn at the rate of Rs.300/- per day for his living. In the ruling reported in Managing Director, 7 TNSTC vs Thahira & 3 others, 2016 (2) TNMAC 611, it is held the notional income fixed by tribunal at Rs. 9,000/- was not excessive. Considering the above legal position , this Tribunal has fixed the monthly income of deceased person as Rs.9,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 11. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. Recently in a ruling reported in in Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (2) TNMAC 55(SC): 2013 (9) SCC 54 , it was decided future prospects applicable in a case of self-employed persons also. The annual income of the deceased was Rs.9,000x12 = Rs. 1,08,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased was 38 years at the time of accident, 50% of income added towards future prospects and the monthly income arrived to Rs. 9,000 + 4,500 = 13,500/-. Deductions: 12. The deceased was married person at the time of accident. There are 3 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/3rd of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/3rd deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs.13,500 – 4,500 = Rs.9,000/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 13. Considering the age of the deceased is 38 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 15 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, the compensation is calculated as Rs.9,000/- x 12 x 15 = Rs.16,20,000/- and therefore the petitioners are entitled Rs. 16,20,000/- as compensation towards loss of income. MEDICAL EXPENSES: 14. P.W.1 has stated in her evidence that in the accident, her son Sivakumar sustained severe injuries on the right side of head, ear, left eyebrow, right chest, both fore ams, fore head and face and immediately after the accident her son was admitted in the 8 Apollo KH Hospital and inspite of treatment, he died on 20.04.2015. The petitioners have claimed Rs.3,00,000/- under this head. They have filed medical bills and marked the same as Ex.P7 series. in which it is seen that they have spent Rs.1,27,424.33 towards medical expenses. Taking into account of Ex.P7 series, this tribunal awards Rs.1,27,450/- as compensation towards medical expenses. 15. That apart, this Tribunal awarded Rs.10,000/- to each of the petitioners 2 to 4 and in total Rs.30,000/- awarded towards love and affection and Rs. 15,000/- is awarded towards funeral expenses and Rs.5,000/- towards transport expenses. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 16,20,000.00 2.Medical Expenses ...Rs. 1,27,450.00 3.Love and affection ...Rs. 50,000.00 4.Funeral Expenses ...Rs. 15,000.00 5.Transport expenses ...Rs. 5,000.00 ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 18,17,450.00 ------------------------ Thus, the petitioners 2 to 4 are entitled to get Rs.18,17,450/- as compensation. POINT NO.4 (MCOP NO.461/2015) 16. The petitioner Balaji has sustained injuries in the accident and immediately he was admitted in Apollo KH Hospital, Vellore and taken treatment and this fact proved from the Ex.P8 Discharge Summary . In Ex.P8, it is mentioned that the petitioner sustained following injuries: 1. Cerebral Contussion 2. Fracture of Right Temporal/Zygomatic Arch 3. Fracture of Right Maxillary Sinus 4. Diabetes Mellitus 5. Right and Left elbow abrasions 6. Right face abrasions 7. Lower hip laceration The injuries 2 and 3 are grievous in nature. 9 17. It is stated that prior to the accident, the petitioner was working as P.G. Assistant in a private school and drawing Rs.15,000/- as salary and due to the injuries sustained by him in the accident he is not able to do his profession as before. The petitioner was referred to Medical board to assess his disability. The Disability certificate issued for the petitioner by the Medical Board is marked as Ex.P10. For the fracture injury the Board had fixed 20% permanent disability. Since, the disability certificate is issued by the Medical Board, the percentage is accepted. Therefore, it is decided the petitioner sustained 20% permanent disability. Hence, considering the age of the petitioner and nature of injuries, this Tribunal inclined to award Rs.3000/- per percentage (derived from 2013 (2) TNMAC 583, In the High Court of Madras, National Insurance Co., Ltd., Vs. G.Ramesh and P.Yoshuva's case) and a sum of Rs.60,000/- is allowed under the head of partial permanent disability in nutshell. 18. The petitioner is aged about 30 years at the time of accident. It is stated he was working as P.G. Assistant in a private school and earned Rs.15,000/- per month. But the petitioner not produced any proof to prove his income. However, considering the age and the injuries sustained by him and his profession, this tribunal assessed the income of petitioner is Rs.6000/- per month. It is proved from the Ex.P8 Discharge Summary, it is not possible to resume his normal work for atleast two months. Hence, this Tribunal has calculated (iii) the loss of income in lumpsum basis viz., 6,000/- x 2 = Rs. 12,000/-. 19. The Ex.P8 Discharge Summary is issued by the Apollo KH Hospital, Melvisharam. It shows that he took treatment from 19.04.2015 to 21.04.2015 as inpatient. Ex.P9 series are the medical bills which show that the petitioner has spent Rs. 9,908.85 towards medical expenses. Hence, this Tribunal awarded Rs.9,900/- towards medical expenses. 20. The petitioner has sustained fracture injury on his head. The socio-economic and living conditions of the petitioner are taken into consideration. The petitioner has taken treatment in the Apollo KH Hospital, Melvisharam without delay and obtained sufficient treatment, anyhow, the pain and sufferings sustained by the petitioner are also taken into consideration. In the circumstances, the Tribunal has awarded Rs.25,000/- towards pain and sufferings. 10 Apart from this, this Tribunal has awarded Rs. 5,000/- towards transportation expenses and Rs. 5,000/- towards extra Nourishment and Rs.2000/- towards damages to clothes and articles. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Partial Permanent Disability ...Rs. 60,000/- 2.Medical expenses ...Rs. 9,900/- 3.Loss of income for 2 months ...Rs. 12,000/- (6000x2) 4.Pain and suffering ...Rs. 25,000/- 5.Transport Expenses ...Rs. 5,000/- 6.Extra nourishment ...Rs. 5,000/- 7.Damages to cloths and articles ...

Hence, the petition is liable to be dismissed as against the 1st respondent. 4. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 2nd RESPONDENT IN BOTH THE PETITONS :- The petition is not maintainable either in law or on facts.

No oral and documentary evidence were let in on the side of the 2nd respondent. The 2nd respondent has filed petitions in IA No. 239/2018 in MCOP 460/2015 and in IA No. 240/2018 in MCOP 461/2015 u/s 170 M.V. Act and the same were allowed on 27.02.2018. POINT NOS.1 & 2: 6. It is the case of the petitioners that on 19.04.2015 at about 10.00 hours, the deceased Sivakumar in MCOP 460/2015 was riding in his two wheeler along with his relative, namely, Balaji (Petitioner in MCOP 461/2015) as a pillion rider on Chennai to Vellore National Highways road to go to Rathinagiri Temple and while he was proceeding opposite to Arapakkam TATA Motors Company, a Maruthi Suzuki Car bearing Registration No TN-07-W-7664, belongs to the 1st respondent, driven by its driver came in a rash ad negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler ridden by Sivakumar and as a result of which, both the rider and pillion rider fell down and sustained grievous injuries all over the body and subsequently, on 20.04.2015 the said Sivakumar died in the Apollo KH hospital, Melvisharam. Since the 1st petitioner in MCOP 460/2015 who was the wife of the 5 deceased Sivakumar died during pendency of the case, the 4th petitioner, who is the mother of the deceased was examined as P.W.1. She has narrated the manner of accident in her evidence as averred in both the petitions. She has admitted in the cross examination that she has not seen the accident. Through P.W.1, the attested xerox copy of F.I.R., was marked as Ex.P1 in which it is seen that regarding the accident, a criminal case was registered by Rathinagiri Police on 19.04.2015 at about 14.00 hours based on the complaint statement given by Balaji who is the petitioner in MCOP No.461/2015 as against the car driver Gautham S/o G. Elango u/s 279 and 337 of IPC., The contents of F.I.R., reflected the petitioners' allegations regarding the manner of accident. Ex.P2 is the xerox copy of Postmortem Certificate. The Motor Vehicle Inspector's Report is marked as Ex.P3 which reveals that this accident was not due to any mechanical defects of the vehicle which would in turn mean that the accident was caused only by the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the car. The petitioners in both the petitions have stated that the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the car owned by the 1st respondent was the main cause for the accident. The petitioners have filed Ex.P6 xerox copy of Insurance Policy to show that the car bearing registration No. TN 07 W 7664 was insured with the 2nd respondent and the insurance policy was in force at the time of accident. 7. The accident was not denied by the respondents 1 and 2. Further they have admitted in their counters that the rider as well as the pillion rider of the two wheeler bearing registration No.TN 23 BC 5727 have sustained injuries in the accident. It is the 1st respondent's contention that as per Ex.P6, the 2nd respondent is liable to compensate the petitioners in both the petitions. On the other hand, the 2nd respondent has contended that the accident occurred due to collision of two nos. of motor vehicles and that the accident took place only due to the fault of the rider of the two wheeler, namely, deceased Sivakumar and therefore, the petitioners are not entitled to get compensation from the 2nd respondent. There is no evidence on record on the side of the 2nd respondent to fix the responsibility for the accident on the part of the deceased Sivakumar who has ridden the two wheeler at the time of accident. Balaji, the petitioner in MCOP 461/2015 has examined himself as P.W.2 and stated in his evidence that on 19.04.2015 at 10.00 A.M., he was riding on pillion in the Hero Passion Pro two wheeler bearing registration No. TN 23 BC 5747 which was ridden by his uncle Sivakumar to go to Rathinagiri temple and that while they were proceeding opposite to TATA Motors Company at Arapakkam, the Maruti Suzuki Car - TN 07 W 7664 came in the same direction and dashed against the two 6 wheeler and that Rathinagiri Police have registered a case against the driver of the car. P.W.2 is the occurrence witness in this case. So, from the evidence of P.W.1 and 2 and from Ex.P1 and P3, the petitioners have proved that the accident was occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st respondent's car driver. Hence, it is held that the 1st Respondent's car driver has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused accident. The 1st respondent is vicariously liable for the negligent act of his driver. As the insurer of the offending vehicle as per Ex.P6, the 2nd respondent is liable to pay compensation to the petitioners in both the petitions and these points are answered accordingly. POINT NO.3 :- (MCOP NO. 460/2015) 8. The 1st petitioner is the wife and 2 and 3 minor petitioners are daughter and son and 4th petitioner is mother of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.4 legal heir certificate. During the pendency of this case, it was reported that the 1st petitioner died and the main petition was amended suitably as per order in I.A. 36/2017, dated 10.01.2016. Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein the doctor opined that the deceased was died of shock and haemorrhage due to head injury. AGE 9. The claimants have not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of deceased person. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 38 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report also the approximate age of deceased was recorded as 38 years. Considering that there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximate age recorded in Ex.P.2 Postmortem report is treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 38 years at the time of accident. INCOME 10. The petitioners claimed Rs.50,00,000/- as compensation. PW1 deposed that the deceased was a pawn broker and also he was doing real estate business at the time of the accident and earned Rs. 50,000/- per month. The petitioners have filed Ex.P5 xerox copy of Pawn Broker licence of the deceased to show the occupation of the deceased. But no income proof is filed. The socio-economic condition forced to any individual to earn at the rate of Rs.300/- per day for his living. In the ruling reported in Managing Director, 7 TNSTC vs Thahira & 3 others, 2016 (2) TNMAC 611, it is held the notional income fixed by tribunal at Rs. 9,000/- was not excessive. Considering the above legal position , this Tribunal has fixed the monthly income of deceased person as Rs.9,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 11. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. Recently in a ruling reported in in Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (2) TNMAC 55(SC): 2013 (9) SCC 54 , it was decided future prospects applicable in a case of self-employed persons also. The annual income of the deceased was Rs.9,000x12 = Rs. 1,08,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased was 38 years at the time of accident, 50% of income added towards future prospects and the monthly income arrived to Rs. 9,000 + 4,500 = 13,500/-. Deductions: 12. The deceased was married person at the time of accident. There are 3 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/3rd of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/3rd deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs.13,500 – 4,500 = Rs.9,000/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 13. Considering the age of the deceased is 38 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 15 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, the compensation is calculated as Rs.9,000/- x 12 x 15 = Rs.16,20,000/- and therefore the petitioners are entitled Rs. 16,20,000/- as compensation towards loss of income. MEDICAL EXPENSES: 14. P.W.1 has stated in her evidence that in the accident, her son Sivakumar sustained severe injuries on the right side of head, ear, left eyebrow, right chest, both fore ams, fore head and face and immediately after the accident her son was admitted in the 8 Apollo KH Hospital and inspite of treatment, he died on 20.04.2015. The petitioners have claimed Rs.3,00,000/- under this head. They have filed medical bills and marked the same as Ex.P7 series. in which it is seen that they have spent Rs.1,27,424.33 towards medical expenses. Taking into account of Ex.P7 series, this tribunal awards Rs.1,27,450/- as compensation towards medical expenses. 15. That apart, this Tribunal awarded Rs.10,000/- to each of the petitioners 2 to 4 and in total Rs.30,000/- awarded towards love and affection and Rs. 15,000/- is awarded towards funeral expenses and Rs.5,000/- towards transport expenses. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 16,20,000.00 2.Medical Expenses ...Rs. 1,27,450.00 3.Love and affection ...Rs. 50,000.00 4.Funeral Expenses ...Rs. 15,000.00 5.Transport expenses ...Rs. 5,000.00 ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 18,17,450.00 ------------------------ Thus, the petitioners 2 to 4 are entitled to get Rs.18,17,450/- as compensation. POINT NO.4 (MCOP NO.461/2015) 16. The petitioner Balaji has sustained injuries in the accident and immediately he was admitted in Apollo KH Hospital, Vellore and taken treatment and this fact proved from the Ex.P8 Discharge Summary . In Ex.P8, it is mentioned that the petitioner sustained following injuries: 1. Cerebral Contussion 2. Fracture of Right Temporal/Zygomatic Arch 3. Fracture of Right Maxillary Sinus 4. Diabetes Mellitus 5. Right and Left elbow abrasions 6. Right face abrasions 7. Lower hip laceration The injuries 2 and 3 are grievous in nature. 9 17. It is stated that prior to the accident, the petitioner was working as P.G. Assistant in a private school and drawing Rs.15,000/- as salary and due to the injuries sustained by him in the accident he is not able to do his profession as before. The petitioner was referred to Medical board to assess his disability. The Disability certificate issued for the petitioner by the Medical Board is marked as Ex.P10. For the fracture injury the Board had fixed 20% permanent disability. Since, the disability certificate is issued by the Medical Board, the percentage is accepted. Therefore, it is decided the petitioner sustained 20% permanent disability. Hence, considering the age of the petitioner and nature of injuries, this Tribunal inclined to award Rs.3000/- per percentage (derived from 2013 (2) TNMAC 583, In the High Court of Madras, National Insurance Co., Ltd., Vs. G.Ramesh and P.Yoshuva's case) and a sum of Rs.60,000/- is allowed under the head of partial permanent disability in nutshell. 18. The petitioner is aged about 30 years at the time of accident. It is stated he was working as P.G. Assistant in a private school and earned Rs.15,000/- per month. But the petitioner not produced any proof to prove his income. However, considering the age and the injuries sustained by him and his profession, this tribunal assessed the income of petitioner is Rs.6000/- per month. It is proved from the Ex.P8 Discharge Summary, it is not possible to resume his normal work for atleast two months. Hence, this Tribunal has calculated (iii) the loss of income in lumpsum basis viz., 6,000/- x 2 = Rs. 12,000/-. 19. The Ex.P8 Discharge Summary is issued by the Apollo KH Hospital, Melvisharam. It shows that he took treatment from 19.04.2015 to 21.04.2015 as inpatient. Ex.P9 series are the medical bills which show that the petitioner has spent Rs. 9,908.85 towards medical expenses. Hence, this Tribunal awarded Rs.9,900/- towards medical expenses. 20. The petitioner has sustained fracture injury on his head. The socio-economic and living conditions of the petitioner are taken into consideration. The petitioner has taken treatment in the Apollo KH Hospital, Melvisharam without delay and obtained sufficient treatment, anyhow, the pain and sufferings sustained by the petitioner are also taken into consideration. In the circumstances, the Tribunal has awarded Rs.25,000/- towards pain and sufferings. 10 Apart from this, this Tribunal has awarded Rs. 5,000/- towards transportation expenses and Rs. 5,000/- towards extra Nourishment and Rs.2000/- towards damages to clothes and articles. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Partial Permanent Disability ...Rs. 60,000/- 2.Medical expenses ...Rs. 9,900/- 3.Loss of income for 2 months ...Rs. 12,000/- (6000x2) 4.Pain and suffering ...Rs. 25,000/- 5.Transport Expenses ...Rs. 5,000/- 6.Extra nourishment ...Rs. 5,000/- 7.Damages to cloths and articles ...

Immediately they were shifted to Apollo KH Hospital, Melvisharam for treatment. On the next day, i.e., 20.04.2015 Sivakumar died in the hospital without responding to the treatment. The accident was reported before the Rathinagiri police and they have registered a case in Crime No.133/2015 u/s. 279 and 337 of IPC and then altered into 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased Sivakumar in MCOP No.460/2015 was doing Pawn Broker business and real estate business and earned Rs.50,000/- per month. The 1st petitioner, the wife of deceased Sivakumar died during the pendency of this case. The 2nd and 3rd petitioners are daughter and son of the deceased Sivakumar and the 4th 3 petitioner is the mother of the deceased Sivakumar. Due to the sudden demise of Sivakumar, his legal representatives, the petitioners have lost their dependency and their bright future is left in lurch. The petitioners in MCOP 460/2015 have claimed Rs.50,00,000/- as compensation. Prior to the accident, the petitioner Balaji in MCOP No.461/2015 was working as P.G. Assistant in Sr. P. Muthaiar School, Panruti and earned Rs.15,000/- per month. Due to the accident he is unable to do his profession as before. Hence, the petitioner filed this claim application claiming compensation of Rs. 20,00,000/- for the injuries sustained by him in the accident. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 1st RESPONDENT IN BOTH THE PETITONS :- These petitions are not maintainable either in law or on facts. The 1st respondent denied all the allegations made in the petition except those that are specifically admitted. The accident was occurred in the National Highways road. The driver of the Car has got valid driving licence at the time of accident. The said vehicle was insured with the 2nd respondent insurance company covered with policy No.0122033114P103031091 and valid from 02.08.2014 to 01.08.2015. Hence, he 1st respondent is not liable to pay any compensation to the petitioners. The 2nd respondent is only liable to pay the compensation to the petitioners. The amount claimed is excessive. Hence, the petition is liable to be dismissed as against the 1st respondent. 4. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 2nd RESPONDENT IN BOTH THE PETITONS :- The petition is not maintainable either in law or on facts. The 2nd respondent denied all the allegations made in the petition except those that are specifically admitted. The accident was occurred in the National Highways road. As per records maintained in the 2nd respondent the vehicle Maruti Suziki Car bearing registration No. TN 07 W 7664 involved in the accident has not been insured with the 2nd Respondent Company. There is no rashness driving of the car driver. Due to rash and negligent riding of the motorcyclist the accident occurred. Further, the accident occurred due to collision of two vehicles. These petitions are bad for non joinder of necessary party. This respondent is an unnecessary party. The petitioners are not entitled for any compensation for the own negligent act of the deceased. The first petitioner S. Kalaivani died due to illness at her father Mani's house at Panruti. The allegations regarding the age, occupation, income of the deceased Sivakumar and Petitioner Balaji are denied. 4 The petitioners in MCOP No.460/2015 have to prove that they are the dependents of the deceased. The age of the petitioners also denied. The nature of injuries alleged to have been sustained by the Petitioner Balaji is also denied. The alleged period of treatment is not admitted. The amount claimed in both the petitions is excessive. Hence, the petitions are liable to be dismissed. 4. The Points : 1.Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent ? 2.Whether the respondents are liable to compensate the petitioners? Which respondent is liable? 3.Whether the petitioners in MCOP 460/2015 are entitled for compensation? if so, how much? 4.Whether the petitioner in MCOP 461/2015 are entitled for compensation? if so, how much? 5. The 4th petitioner in MCOP No.460/2015 was examined as PW1. The petitioner in MCOP 461/2015 was examined as P.W.2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P.10 were marked on the side of the Petitioners. No oral and documentary evidence were let in on the side of the 2nd respondent. The 2nd respondent has filed petitions in IA No. 239/2018 in MCOP 460/2015 and in IA No. 240/2018 in MCOP 461/2015 u/s 170 M.V. Act and the same were allowed on 27.02.2018. POINT NOS.1 & 2: 6. It is the case of the petitioners that on 19.04.2015 at about 10.00 hours, the deceased Sivakumar in MCOP 460/2015 was riding in his two wheeler along with his relative, namely, Balaji (Petitioner in MCOP 461/2015) as a pillion rider on Chennai to Vellore National Highways road to go to Rathinagiri Temple and while he was proceeding opposite to Arapakkam TATA Motors Company, a Maruthi Suzuki Car bearing Registration No TN-07-W-7664, belongs to the 1st respondent, driven by its driver came in a rash ad negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler ridden by Sivakumar and as a result of which, both the rider and pillion rider fell down and sustained grievous injuries all over the body and subsequently, on 20.04.2015 the said Sivakumar died in the Apollo KH hospital, Melvisharam. Since the 1st petitioner in MCOP 460/2015 who was the wife of the 5 deceased Sivakumar died during pendency of the case, the 4th petitioner, who is the mother of the deceased was examined as P.W.1. She has narrated the manner of accident in her evidence as averred in both the petitions. She has admitted in the cross examination that she has not seen the accident. Through P.W.1, the attested xerox copy of F.I.R., was marked as Ex.P1 in which it is seen that regarding the accident, a criminal case was registered by Rathinagiri Police on 19.04.2015 at about 14.00 hours based on the complaint statement given by Balaji who is the petitioner in MCOP No.461/2015 as against the car driver Gautham S/o G. Elango u/s 279 and 337 of IPC., The contents of F.I.R., reflected the petitioners' allegations regarding the manner of accident. Ex.P2 is the xerox copy of Postmortem Certificate. The Motor Vehicle Inspector's Report is marked as Ex.P3 which reveals that this accident was not due to any mechanical defects of the vehicle which would in turn mean that the accident was caused only by the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the car. The petitioners in both the petitions have stated that the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the car owned by the 1st respondent was the main cause for the accident. The petitioners have filed Ex.P6 xerox copy of Insurance Policy to show that the car bearing registration No. TN 07 W 7664 was insured with the 2nd respondent and the insurance policy was in force at the time of accident. 7. The accident was not denied by the respondents 1 and 2. Further they have admitted in their counters that the rider as well as the pillion rider of the two wheeler bearing registration No.TN 23 BC 5727 have sustained injuries in the accident. It is the 1st respondent's contention that as per Ex.P6, the 2nd respondent is liable to compensate the petitioners in both the petitions. On the other hand, the 2nd respondent has contended that the accident occurred due to collision of two nos. of motor vehicles and that the accident took place only due to the fault of the rider of the two wheeler, namely, deceased Sivakumar and therefore, the petitioners are not entitled to get compensation from the 2nd respondent. There is no evidence on record on the side of the 2nd respondent to fix the responsibility for the accident on the part of the deceased Sivakumar who has ridden the two wheeler at the time of accident. Balaji, the petitioner in MCOP 461/2015 has examined himself as P.W.2 and stated in his evidence that on 19.04.2015 at 10.00 A.M., he was riding on pillion in the Hero Passion Pro two wheeler bearing registration No. TN 23 BC 5747 which was ridden by his uncle Sivakumar to go to Rathinagiri temple and that while they were proceeding opposite to TATA Motors Company at Arapakkam, the Maruti Suzuki Car - TN 07 W 7664 came in the same direction and dashed against the two 6 wheeler and that Rathinagiri Police have registered a case against the driver of the car. P.W.2 is the occurrence witness in this case. So, from the evidence of P.W.1 and 2 and from Ex.P1 and P3, the petitioners have proved that the accident was occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st respondent's car driver. Hence, it is held that the 1st Respondent's car driver has driven the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused accident. The 1st respondent is vicariously liable for the negligent act of his driver. As the insurer of the offending vehicle as per Ex.P6, the 2nd respondent is liable to pay compensation to the petitioners in both the petitions and these points are answered accordingly. POINT NO.3 :- (MCOP NO. 460/2015) 8. The 1st petitioner is the wife and 2 and 3 minor petitioners are daughter and son and 4th petitioner is mother of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.4 legal heir certificate. During the pendency of this case, it was reported that the 1st petitioner died and the main petition was amended suitably as per order in I.A. 36/2017, dated 10.01.2016. Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein the doctor opined that the deceased was died of shock and haemorrhage due to head injury. AGE 9. The claimants have not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of deceased person. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 38 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report also the approximate age of deceased was recorded as 38 years. Considering that there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximate age recorded in Ex.P.2 Postmortem report is treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 38 years at the time of accident. INCOME 10. The petitioners claimed Rs.50,00,000/- as compensation. PW1 deposed that the deceased was a pawn broker and also he was doing real estate business at the time of the accident and earned Rs. 50,000/- per month. The petitioners have filed Ex.P5 xerox copy of Pawn Broker licence of the deceased to show the occupation of the deceased. But no income proof is filed. The socio-economic condition forced to any individual to earn at the rate of Rs.300/- per day for his living. In the ruling reported in Managing Director, 7 TNSTC vs Thahira & 3 others, 2016 (2) TNMAC 611, it is held the notional income fixed by tribunal at Rs. 9,000/- was not excessive. Considering the above legal position , this Tribunal has fixed the monthly income of deceased person as Rs.9,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 11. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. Recently in a ruling reported in in Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (2) TNMAC 55(SC): 2013 (9) SCC 54 , it was decided future prospects applicable in a case of self-employed persons also. The annual income of the deceased was Rs.9,000x12 = Rs. 1,08,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased was 38 years at the time of accident, 50% of income added towards future prospects and the monthly income arrived to Rs. 9,000 + 4,500 = 13,500/-. Deductions: 12. The deceased was married person at the time of accident. There are 3 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/3rd of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/3rd deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs.13,500 – 4,500 = Rs.9,000/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 13. Considering the age of the deceased is 38 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 15 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, the compensation is calculated as Rs.9,000/- x 12 x 15 = Rs.16,20,000/- and therefore the petitioners are entitled Rs. 16,20,000/- as compensation towards loss of income. MEDICAL EXPENSES: 14. P.W.1 has stated in her evidence that in the accident, her son Sivakumar sustained severe injuries on the right side of head, ear, left eyebrow, right chest, both fore ams, fore head and face and immediately after the accident her son was admitted in the 8 Apollo KH Hospital and inspite of treatment, he died on 20.04.2015. The petitioners have claimed Rs.3,00,000/- under this head. They have filed medical bills and marked the same as Ex.P7 series. in which it is seen that they have spent Rs.1,27,424.33 towards medical expenses. Taking into account of Ex.P7 series, this tribunal awards Rs.1,27,450/- as compensation towards medical expenses. 15. That apart, this Tribunal awarded Rs.10,000/- to each of the petitioners 2 to 4 and in total Rs.30,000/- awarded towards love and affection and Rs. 15,000/- is awarded towards funeral expenses and Rs.5,000/- towards transport expenses. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 16,20,000.00 2.Medical Expenses ...Rs. 1,27,450.00 3.Love and affection ...Rs. 50,000.00 4.Funeral Expenses ...Rs. 15,000.00 5.Transport expenses ...Rs. 5,000.00 ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 18,17,450.00 ------------------------ Thus, the petitioners 2 to 4 are entitled to get Rs.18,17,450/- as compensation. POINT NO.4 (MCOP NO.461/2015) 16. The petitioner Balaji has sustained injuries in the accident and immediately he was admitted in Apollo KH Hospital, Vellore and taken treatment and this fact proved from the Ex.P8 Discharge Summary . In Ex.P8, it is mentioned that the petitioner sustained following injuries: 1. Cerebral Contussion 2. Fracture of Right Temporal/Zygomatic Arch 3. Fracture of Right Maxillary Sinus 4. Diabetes Mellitus 5. Right and Left elbow abrasions 6. Right face abrasions 7. Lower hip laceration The injuries 2 and 3 are grievous in nature. 9 17. It is stated that prior to the accident, the petitioner was working as P.G. Assistant in a private school and drawing Rs.15,000/- as salary and due to the injuries sustained by him in the accident he is not able to do his profession as before. The petitioner was referred to Medical board to assess his disability. The Disability certificate issued for the petitioner by the Medical Board is marked as Ex.P10. For the fracture injury the Board had fixed 20% permanent disability. Since, the disability certificate is issued by the Medical Board, the percentage is accepted. Therefore, it is decided the petitioner sustained 20% permanent disability. Hence, considering the age of the petitioner and nature of injuries, this Tribunal inclined to award Rs.3000/- per percentage (derived from 2013 (2) TNMAC 583, In the High Court of Madras, National Insurance Co., Ltd., Vs. G.Ramesh and P.Yoshuva's case) and a sum of Rs.60,000/- is allowed under the head of partial permanent disability in nutshell. 18. The petitioner is aged about 30 years at the time of accident. It is stated he was working as P.G. Assistant in a private school and earned Rs.15,000/- per month. But the petitioner not produced any proof to prove his income. However, considering the age and the injuries sustained by him and his profession, this tribunal assessed the income of petitioner is Rs.6000/- per month. It is proved from the Ex.P8 Discharge Summary, it is not possible to resume his normal work for atleast two months. Hence, this Tribunal has calculated (iii) the loss of income in lumpsum basis viz., 6,000/- x 2 = Rs. 12,000/-. 19. The Ex.P8 Discharge Summary is issued by the Apollo KH Hospital, Melvisharam. It shows that he took treatment from 19.04.2015 to 21.04.2015 as inpatient. Ex.P9 series are the medical bills which show that the petitioner has spent Rs. 9,908.85 towards medical expenses. Hence, this Tribunal awarded Rs.9,900/- towards medical expenses. 20. The petitioner has sustained fracture injury on his head. The socio-economic and living conditions of the petitioner are taken into consideration. The petitioner has taken treatment in the Apollo KH Hospital, Melvisharam without delay and obtained sufficient treatment, anyhow, the pain and sufferings sustained by the petitioner are also taken into consideration. In the circumstances, the Tribunal has awarded Rs.25,000/- towards pain and sufferings. 10 Apart from this, this Tribunal has awarded Rs. 5,000/- towards transportation expenses and Rs. 5,000/- towards extra Nourishment and Rs.2000/- towards damages to clothes and articles. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Partial Permanent Disability ...Rs. 60,000/- 2.Medical expenses ...Rs. 9,900/- 3.Loss of income for 2 months ...Rs. 12,000/- (6000x2) 4.Pain and suffering ...Rs. 25,000/- 5.Transport Expenses ...Rs. 5,000/- 6.Extra nourishment ...Rs. 5,000/- 7.Damages to cloths and articles ... Rs. 2,000/- ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 1,18,900/- ------------------------- Thus, the petitioner is entitled to get Rs.1,18,900/- as compensation.

Vetrichelvi, M.L., Motor Accident Claims Tribunal Judge/ I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Vellore. Monday, the 12th day of March, 2018. M.C.O.P.No. 397/2015 1. P. Latha 2. P. Rubina 3. P. Swamidoss 4. Minor P. Kushboo Minor represented by her mother/ next friend the 1st petitioner Latha ... Petitioners /Vs/ 1. Kumaravel 2. S. Saravanan ... Respondents. This petition, coming up for final hearing before this Tribunal, on 27.02.2018, in the presence of Thiru S. Senthilkumaran, Advocate for the Petitioners and Thiru T.V. Sathiyamoorthy and Thiru D. Vinodhkumar, Advocates for the 1st respondent and Thiru B. Ganeshbabu, Advocate for the 2nd respondent, on hearing the arguments of both side and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court delivered the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1.

That on 26.04.2014 at about 9.00 P.M., while the deceased was walking towards his house on the left side of Thimiri - Kalavai Road opposite to the land of 2 Anna Nagar Gopal, a two wheeler bearing registration No. TN 73 E 5169 owned by the 2nd respondent, ridden by the 1st respondent came rashly and negligently behind the said Pandiyan and hit him on his back vehemently and as a result of which he sustained fatal injuries and died on the spot itself. Postmortem was done in the Government Hospital, Arcot. Thimiri Police have registered a case in Cr.No.116/2014 u/s 279 and 304(A) of IPC., Prior to the accident, the deceased was an agriculturist and he was also doing seasonal business and thereby earned Rs.15,000/- per month. The entire family depending upon the income of the deceased and now they are left in lurch. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs.10,00,000/- for the death of Pandiyan as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER OF THE 1st RESPONDENT:- The petition is not maintainable either in law or on facts. The respondent denied all the allegations made in the petition save those that are specifically admitted. The manner of accident is denied. The fact is that the deceased Pandiyan suddenly and abruptly darted across the road without noticing the two wheeler coming behind him and thereby invited the alleged accident. At the time of accident, it was dark. The deceased was solely responsible for the accident. The case filed against the 1st respondent in C.C. No.29/2015 on the file of Judicial Magistrate court, No.I, Walajahpet was ended in acquittal. The allegations regarding the age, occupation and income of the deceased are denied. The amount claimed as compensation and interest are highly excessive. Hence, the petition is liable to be dismissed. 4. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER OF THE 2nd RESPONDENT:- The petition is not maintainable either in law or on facts. The respondent denied all the allegations made in the petition save those that are specifically admitted. The manner of accident is denied. The fact is that the deceased Pandiyan suddenly and abruptly darted across the road without noticing the two wheeler coming behind him and thereby invited the alleged accident. At the time of accident, it was dark. The deceased was solely responsible for the accident. The case filed against the 1st respondent in C.C. No.29/2015 on the file of Judicial Magistrate court, No.I, Walajahpet was ended in acquittal. The allegations regarding the age, occupation and income of the deceased are 3 denied. The amount claimed as compensation and interest are highly excessive. Hence, the petition is liable to be dismissed. 5. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of the 1st respondent? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 6. The 1st petitioner has examined herself as PW1 and one Mr. John, was examined as PW2. Ex.P1 to P5 were marked on the side of the petitioners. No witness was examined on the side of the respondents. Ex.R1 was marked during the cross examination of P.W.2. POINT NO.1: 7. It is the case of the petitioners that on 26.04.2014 at about 9.00 P.M., while the deceased was walking towards his house on the left side of Thimiri - Kalavai Road opposite to the land of Anna Nagar Gopal, a two wheeler bearing registration No. TN 73 E 5169 owned by the 2nd respondent, ridden by the 1st respondent came rashly and negligently behind the said Pandiyan and hit him on his back vehemently and as a result of which he sustained fatal injuries and died on the spot itself. To prove the case, the wife of the deceased/1st petitioner was examined as P.W.1. She has narrated the manner of accident as averred in the petition. She has admitted in the cross examination that she did not see the accident directly. P.W.2 Thiru John deposed that at the time of accident, he accompanied the deceased on the way to their house. He added that the deceased was his paternal uncle. The accident was reported to the Thimiri police and they have registered a case in crime No. 116/2014 u/s. 279 and 304(A) IPC., against the 1st respondent which is evidenced from Ex.P1 certified xerox copy of F.I.R., The two wheeler TN 73 E 5169 was inspected by the M.V. Inspector and the certified xerox copy of M.V.I. report was marked as Ex.P4. In Ex.P4, it was stated that there was no mechanical defect in the vehicle. Ex.P5 xerox copy of Certificate of Registration disclosed that the 1st respondent is the owner of the two wheeler TN 73 E 5169. 8. The respondents have contended that the accident did not occur due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent, per contra, the deceased has invited the 4 accident by his negligent act since he darted across the road suddenly and abruptly without noticing the two wheeler which came behind him and thus hit against the two wheeler. On the side of the 1st respondent, written argument filed stating that the 1st respondent was not found guilty and acquitted from the charges framed against him for the offences of rash and negligent driving and causing death of Pandiyan and that P.W.1 and 2 have given different version about the time of accident and that P.W.2 who is said to have been seen the occurrence has not identified the 1st respondent as the accused before the Judicial Magistrate Court, No.I, Walajah which would in turn mean that he did not see the occurrence as alleged and hence, the petition is liable to be dismissed. The certified xerox copy of Judgment in C.C. No.29/2015 on the file of Judicial Magistrate Court, No.I Walajah is marked as Ex.R1 in which it is seen that the accused Kumaravel who is the 1st respondent herein was acquitted by the Judicial Magistrate, No.I, Walajah. It is vehemently argued on the side of the 1st respondent that the eye witness John has not identified the accused and that he has not seen the occurrence and that the 1st respondent was acquitted from the criminal case and that the respondents 1 and 2 are not liable to compensate the petitioners and hence, the petition is liable to be dismissed. It is pertinent to note that in the counter itself, the respondents have admitted that at the time of accident, it was dark. So, there is every chance for the eye witness to say that he could not identify the accused. Ex.P1 F.I.R., was registered against the 1st respondent who was the rider of two wheeler bearing registration No.TN 73 E 5169. After investigation, the police have prosecuted him for the offences of rash and negligent driving and causing death of Pandiyan. If there is no fault on the part of the 1st respondent, there is no necessity for the police to file charge sheet as against him. The verdict of Judicial Magistrate court do not bind this tribunal. It is settled law that the acquittal Judgment of the Judicial Magistrate Court has no relevancy to the claim application and the tribunal has to decide the negligence independently based upon the materials available in the case on hand. The respondents' contention that the deceased has invited the accident by his own negligence was not supported with any documentary proof. The respondents 1 and 2 have not even chosen to enter into the witness box to prove their contentions. So, it is held that the accident took place only due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent and the 2nd respondent who is the owner, is vicariously liable for the negligent act of the rider. From Ex.P5 it is seen that the offending vehicle was purchased by the 2nd respondent on 14.02.2013. The respondents have not proved that they have possessed valid driving licence at the time of accident. A vehicle which is allowed to ply on the road 5 without licence or insurance coverage is against the road rules and regulations as well as the provisions of Motor Vehicle Act. It is not stated and proved by the petitioners that the offending vehicle was having insurance coverage at the time of accident. Therefore, it is decided that both the respondents are jointly and severally liable to compensate the petitioners and this point is answered thus. POINT NO.2: 9. The petitioners are the wife, daughters and son of the deceased. Ex.P3 Legal Heirship Certificate reveals the said fact. The petitioners have claimed compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- as compensation. AGE 10. The petitioners have averred in the petition that the deceased was aged 40 years at the time of accident. The petitioners have not filed any reliable document to show the age of the deceased. Ex.P2 is the certified xerox copy of postmortem certificate of deceased in which the age of the deceased is mentioned as 38 years. As there is no proof of age, the age mentioned in Ex.P2 Postmortem Certificate is taking into account and hence the age of deceased is fixed as 38 years at the time of accident. INCOME 11. The petitioners have claimed Rs.10,00,000/- as compensation. P.W.1 deposed the deceased was doing agriculture and also seasonal business and thereby earned Rs.15,000/- per month. But she has not mentioned as to what type of seasonal business that the deceased was doing while he alive. P.W.2 deposed that the deceased was selling safety pins and thread etc., No income proof is filed. Considering the age and date of accident, this Tribunal has fixed the notional income of deceased person as Rs.6,500/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 12. Recently the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided in The National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and Others, Special Leave petition (Civil) No. 25590 of 2014 order dated 31.10.2017, that in case of person has self employed on a fixed salary, an additional of 40% of the established income should be the warrant where the deceased was below the age of 40 years. An addition of 25% where the deceased was between the age of 40 to 50 years and 10% where the deceased was between the age of 50 to 60 years should be regarded as the necessary method of computation. In this 6 case, the age of the deceased was 38 at the time of accident. The occupation and monthly income of the deceased were not established in an acceptable manner. This court fixed the notional monthly incomeof the deceased as Rs.6,500/-. So, this is not a fit case to award compensation under the head of future prospects. Deductions: 13. The deceased was married person at the time of accident. There are 4 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/4th of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/4th deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs.6,500 – Rs.1,625/- = Rs.4,875/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 14. Considering the age of the deceased is 38 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 15 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, the compensation calculated to Rs.4,875/- x 12 x 15 = Rs.8,77,500/- and therefore the petitioners are entitled Rs.8,77,500/- as compensation towards loss of income. LOVE AND AFFECTION 15. The petitioners 2 to 4 are children of the deceased. They have lost their love & affection of the deceased. Hence, a lumpsum of Rs.30,000/- is awarded as compensation towards love and affection. 16. As per the dictum laid down in The National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and Others, Special Leave petition (Civil) No. 25590 of 2014 order dated 31.10.2017, This tribunal awarded Rs.40,000/- towards loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner and Rs.5,000/- is awarded towards funeral expenses. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ... Rs. 8,77,500/- 2.Loss of Love & Affection … Rs. 30,000/- 3.Loss of consortium ... Rs. 40,000/- 4.Funeral expenses ... Rs. 5,000/- ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 9,52,500/- ------------------------- 7 In the result, this petition is allowed with costs and the petitioners are entitled for Rs. 9,52,500/- (Rupees Nine Lakhs and Fifty Two Thousand and Five Hundred only) as compensation . The respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally directed to pay and deposit the award amount into this court within 4 weeks from this day with interest at 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this petition (13.11.2014) till the date of deposit, excluding period of default if any.

The 1st petitioner, who is the wife of the deceased is entitled to get Rs. 2,52,500/- from the above award amount. The 2nd petitioner is entitled to get Rs.2,00,000/- as her share and the 3rd petitioner is entitled to get Rs. 2,00,000/- as his share and the minor 4th petitioner is entitled to get Rs.3,00,000/- as her share in the award amount. In the first instance, the petitioners 1 to 3 are ordered to receive 50% along with entire interest accrued thereupon on it and costs.

Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of the 1st respondent? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 6. The 1st petitioner has examined herself as PW1 and one Mr. John, was examined as PW2. Ex.P1 to P5 were marked on the side of the petitioners. No witness was examined on the side of the respondents. Ex.R1 was marked during the cross examination of P.W.2. POINT NO.1: 7. It is the case of the petitioners that on 26.04.2014 at about 9.00 P.M., while the deceased was walking towards his house on the left side of Thimiri - Kalavai Road opposite to the land of Anna Nagar Gopal, a two wheeler bearing registration No. TN 73 E 5169 owned by the 2nd respondent, ridden by the 1st respondent came rashly and negligently behind the said Pandiyan and hit him on his back vehemently and as a result of which he sustained fatal injuries and died on the spot itself. To prove the case, the wife of the deceased/1st petitioner was examined as P.W.1. She has narrated the manner of accident as averred in the petition. She has admitted in the cross examination that she did not see the accident directly. P.W.2 Thiru John deposed that at the time of accident, he accompanied the deceased on the way to their house. He added that the deceased was his paternal uncle. The accident was reported to the Thimiri police and they have registered a case in crime No. 116/2014 u/s. 279 and 304(A) IPC., against the 1st respondent which is evidenced from Ex.P1 certified xerox copy of F.I.R., The two wheeler TN 73 E 5169 was inspected by the M.V. Inspector and the certified xerox copy of M.V.I. report was marked as Ex.P4. In Ex.P4, it was stated that there was no mechanical defect in the vehicle. Ex.P5 xerox copy of Certificate of Registration disclosed that the 1st respondent is the owner of the two wheeler TN 73 E 5169. 8. The respondents have contended that the accident did not occur due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent, per contra, the deceased has invited the 4 accident by his negligent act since he darted across the road suddenly and abruptly without noticing the two wheeler which came behind him and thus hit against the two wheeler. On the side of the 1st respondent, written argument filed stating that the 1st respondent was not found guilty and acquitted from the charges framed against him for the offences of rash and negligent driving and causing death of Pandiyan and that P.W.1 and 2 have given different version about the time of accident and that P.W.2 who is said to have been seen the occurrence has not identified the 1st respondent as the accused before the Judicial Magistrate Court, No.I, Walajah which would in turn mean that he did not see the occurrence as alleged and hence, the petition is liable to be dismissed. The certified xerox copy of Judgment in C.C. No.29/2015 on the file of Judicial Magistrate Court, No.I Walajah is marked as Ex.R1 in which it is seen that the accused Kumaravel who is the 1st respondent herein was acquitted by the Judicial Magistrate, No.I, Walajah. It is vehemently argued on the side of the 1st respondent that the eye witness John has not identified the accused and that he has not seen the occurrence and that the 1st respondent was acquitted from the criminal case and that the respondents 1 and 2 are not liable to compensate the petitioners and hence, the petition is liable to be dismissed. It is pertinent to note that in the counter itself, the respondents have admitted that at the time of accident, it was dark. So, there is every chance for the eye witness to say that he could not identify the accused. Ex.P1 F.I.R., was registered against the 1st respondent who was the rider of two wheeler bearing registration No.TN 73 E 5169. After investigation, the police have prosecuted him for the offences of rash and negligent driving and causing death of Pandiyan. If there is no fault on the part of the 1st respondent, there is no necessity for the police to file charge sheet as against him. The verdict of Judicial Magistrate court do not bind this tribunal. It is settled law that the acquittal Judgment of the Judicial Magistrate Court has no relevancy to the claim application and the tribunal has to decide the negligence independently based upon the materials available in the case on hand. The respondents' contention that the deceased has invited the accident by his own negligence was not supported with any documentary proof. The respondents 1 and 2 have not even chosen to enter into the witness box to prove their contentions. So, it is held that the accident took place only due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent and the 2nd respondent who is the owner, is vicariously liable for the negligent act of the rider. From Ex.P5 it is seen that the offending vehicle was purchased by the 2nd respondent on 14.02.2013. The respondents have not proved that they have possessed valid driving licence at the time of accident. A vehicle which is allowed to ply on the road 5 without licence or insurance coverage is against the road rules and regulations as well as the provisions of Motor Vehicle Act. It is not stated and proved by the petitioners that the offending vehicle was having insurance coverage at the time of accident. Therefore, it is decided that both the respondents are jointly and severally liable to compensate the petitioners and this point is answered thus. POINT NO.2: 9. The petitioners are the wife, daughters and son of the deceased. Ex.P3 Legal Heirship Certificate reveals the said fact. The petitioners have claimed compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- as compensation. AGE 10. The petitioners have averred in the petition that the deceased was aged 40 years at the time of accident. The petitioners have not filed any reliable document to show the age of the deceased. Ex.P2 is the certified xerox copy of postmortem certificate of deceased in which the age of the deceased is mentioned as 38 years. As there is no proof of age, the age mentioned in Ex.P2 Postmortem Certificate is taking into account and hence the age of deceased is fixed as 38 years at the time of accident. INCOME 11. The petitioners have claimed Rs.10,00,000/- as compensation. P.W.1 deposed the deceased was doing agriculture and also seasonal business and thereby earned Rs.15,000/- per month. But she has not mentioned as to what type of seasonal business that the deceased was doing while he alive. P.W.2 deposed that the deceased was selling safety pins and thread etc., No income proof is filed. Considering the age and date of accident, this Tribunal has fixed the notional income of deceased person as Rs.6,500/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 12. Recently the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided in The National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and Others, Special Leave petition (Civil) No. 25590 of 2014 order dated 31.10.2017, that in case of person has self employed on a fixed salary, an additional of 40% of the established income should be the warrant where the deceased was below the age of 40 years. An addition of 25% where the deceased was between the age of 40 to 50 years and 10% where the deceased was between the age of 50 to 60 years should be regarded as the necessary method of computation. In this 6 case, the age of the deceased was 38 at the time of accident. The occupation and monthly income of the deceased were not established in an acceptable manner. This court fixed the notional monthly incomeof the deceased as Rs.6,500/-. So, this is not a fit case to award compensation under the head of future prospects. Deductions: 13. The deceased was married person at the time of accident. There are 4 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/4th of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/4th deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs.6,500 – Rs.1,625/- = Rs.4,875/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 14. Considering the age of the deceased is 38 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 15 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, the compensation calculated to Rs.4,875/- x 12 x 15 = Rs.8,77,500/- and therefore the petitioners are entitled Rs.8,77,500/- as compensation towards loss of income. LOVE AND AFFECTION 15. The petitioners 2 to 4 are children of the deceased. They have lost their love & affection of the deceased. Hence, a lumpsum of Rs.30,000/- is awarded as compensation towards love and affection. 16. As per the dictum laid down in The National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and Others, Special Leave petition (Civil) No. 25590 of 2014 order dated 31.10.2017, This tribunal awarded Rs.40,000/- towards loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner and Rs.5,000/- is awarded towards funeral expenses. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ... Rs. 8,77,500/- 2.Loss of Love & Affection … Rs. 30,000/- 3.Loss of consortium ... Rs. 40,000/- 4.Funeral expenses ... Rs. 5,000/- ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 9,52,500/- ------------------------- 7 In the result, this petition is allowed with costs and the petitioners are entitled for Rs. 9,52,500/- (Rupees Nine Lakhs and Fifty Two Thousand and Five Hundred only) as compensation . The respondents 1 and 2 are jointly and severally directed to pay and deposit the award amount into this court within 4 weeks from this day with interest at 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this petition (13.11.2014) till the date of deposit, excluding period of default if any.

The certified xerox copy of Judgment in C.C. No.29/2015 on the file of Judicial Magistrate Court, No.I Walajah is marked as Ex.R1 in which it is seen that the accused Kumaravel who is the 1st respondent herein was acquitted by the Judicial Magistrate, No.I, Walajah.

AGE 10. The petitioners have averred in the petition that the deceased was aged 40 years at the time of accident. The petitioners have not filed any reliable document to show the age of the deceased. Ex.P2 is the certified xerox copy of postmortem certificate of deceased in which the age of the deceased is mentioned as 38 years. As there is no proof of age, the age mentioned in Ex.P2 Postmortem Certificate is taking into account and hence the age of deceased is fixed as 38 years at the time of accident. INCOME 11. The petitioners have claimed Rs.10,00,000/- as compensation. P.W.1 deposed the deceased was doing agriculture and also seasonal business and thereby earned Rs.15,000/- per month.

Brief averments of Counter filed by the 2 nd respondent as follows:- This petition is not maintainable either in law or on facts. All the petition averments are denied, except those that are admitted by the 2nd respondent herein. This respondent stated that the narration of the incident is distortions of the truth and is ingenious invention of the petitioner to suit his convenient. The driver of the auto was neither rash nor negligent at the time of accident. On the other hand, the petitioner drove his bicycle having unmindful of the oncoming vehicle in the road and dashed against the auto and sustained injuries. This respondent further stated that the 1st respondent's driver drove the vehicle without valid and current driving licence and it is quite against the terms and conditions of Policy. The ALA, Vellore has also issued CR in this regard for not having the DL by the driver of the auto vide CR.No.A0082196. Hence, this respondent is not liable to pay any compensation to the petitioner. The age, occupation and income of the petitioner is not correct. There is no permanent disability to the petitioner. This respondent reserves his right to file additional counter with the leave of the court in this case if this respondent comes to know of pertinent details touching the merits of the case later. The compensation claimed by the petitioner is very high. Hence, this respondent prays to dismiss the petition. 5. On the side of the petitioner, the petitioner has been examined as P.W.1 and Ex.P.1 to P.8 were marked through P.W.1. On /4/ the side of the 2nd respondent, R.W.1 was examined and Ex.R.1 alone marked. The Court document, Disability Certificate issued by the Joint Director of Medical and Rural Health Services, Vellore-1 is marked as Ex.C1. 6. The point for consideration in this petition are as follows:- (1)Whether this accident has occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the Auto bearing Regn.No.TN-23-AE-4194 ? (2)Who is liable to pay the compensation? (3)Whether the Petitioner is entitled to compensation? and if so, what is the the quantum? 7. Point No.1: (i) It is the case of the petitioner, that on 29.05.2015 at about 18.00 Hrs. Konavattam to Ambur road opposite to CMC compound Vellore Taluk Police Station limit, while the petitioner riding his bicycle at extreme left side of the road from East to West direction by following the traffic rules and regulations at that time 1st respondent auto bearing Regn.No.TN- 23-AE-4194 was driven by its driver Selvam in a very rash and negligent manner without following the traffic rules and regulations and without blow of any horn from west to east direction in an uncontrollable speed hit and dashed against the petitioner vehimently due to the strong hit impact the rider of the bicycle sustained grevious injuries and multiple simple injuries all over his body. /5/ (ii) To prove the case of the petitioner, the petitioner filed the copy of FIR and the same is marked as Ex.P.1. In the FIR, the driver of the Auto bearing Regn.No.TN-23-AE-4194 was shown in the accused column. Even though, the 2nd respondent in their counter stated that the petitioner drove his bicycle having unmindful of the oncoming vehicle in the road and dashed against the auto and sustained injuries, but to prove the same no oral or documentary evidence produced by the 2nd respondent. The 2nd Respondent has not brought anything contra from the cross examination of PW1 as to the cause of the accident. The first respondent has not taken any steps to quash the FIR . (iii) Hence, from the oral evidence of P.W.1 and the documentary evidence of Ex.P1, the FIR copy and since there is no contra evidence available to disprove the accident, this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the accident has occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the Auto bearing Regn.No.TN-23-AE-4194 . Thus the Point No. (1) is answered accordingly. 8. Point No.2 :- (i) In Point No.(1), it has been found that the accident has occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the Auto bearing Regn.No.TN-23-AE-4194. (ii) The Second respondent has not denied about the insurance policy but stated in their counter that the driver of the Auto has not possessed valid /6/ driving licence at the time of accident. To prove the same, filed the Investigation report of the Investigator of the 2nd respondent, through R.W.1 and the same is marked as Ex.R.1. On perusal of Ex.R.1, it is seen that the 1st respondent's driver had no driving licence to drive the Auto and he paid the fine in the RTO office, Vellore. (iii) The petitioner filed the copy of the Insurance Policy and the same is marked as Ex.P.4. On perusal of Ex.P.4, the 1st respondent vehicle is validly insured with the 2nd respondent on the date of accident vide Policy No.0130003114P100691086 valid from 24.06.2014 to 23.06.2015 . The date of accident is 29.05.2015. The 2nd respondent did not file any documentary evidence to disprove the accident and also not denied about the policy mentioned in the Ex.P.4. Therefore, it is considered that the said 1st respondent’s Auto bearing Regn.No.TN.23-AE-4194 had a valid insurance policy issued by the 2nd respondent at the time of the accident and there is a violation of Policy conditions. Hence, the Second respondent being the insurer is liable to pay the compensation to the petitioner at the first instance with a liberty to recover the same from the 1st respondent without filing any petition. Accordingly the Point No.(2) is answered. 9. Point No.(3) (i) In this petition, and as P.W.1 in his evidence, the petitioner has stated as to the injuries sustained by him in detail. The copy of the /7/ Discharge summary issued by the Government Vellore Medical College Hospital, Velllore and the X-ray report given by the said Hospital and the same are marked as Ex.P.2 and Ex.P.8. As per Ex.P.2, the petitioner was treated as inpatient in Government Vellore Medical College Hospital, Vellore from 29.05.2015 to 02.06.2015. On perusal of the Ex.P.2 Discharge Certificate and Ex,.P.8 X-ray Report, it is seen that the petitioner has sustained fracture in left 5th MCB and was treated with antibiotics analgesics and the injuy appears to be grievous in nature. The PW1 has not examined the Doctor who has given treatment to him. The Ex.C1 is the Disability Certificate issued by the Joint Director of Medical and Rural Health Services, Vellore and it shows the disability percentage as 10%. Hence this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the Petitioner has suffered partial and permanent disability of 10% and the Petitioner is entitled for compensation for the injuries sustained by him, Rs.3,000/- per percentage is allowed. Hence the Petitioner is entitled for Rs.30,000/- only as just compensation for the injuries sustained by him. (ii) Income of the Petitioner: The Petitioner stated in his petition that he was working as Building Iron Rod Construction worker and was earning a sum of Rs.15,000/- per month at the time of accident. But t o prove his avocation and monthly /8/ income, he has not filed any documentary evidence. Hence in these circumstances, the notional income has to be fixed. Accordingly considering the age of the petitioner Rs.8,000/- is fixed as monthly notional income of the petitioner. (iii) Compensation for Pain and Sufferings: The Petitioner has sustained above said injuries and he took treatment as inpatient totally for 5 days in Government Vellore Medical College Hospital, Vellore. Hence, this Tribunal considers to award Rs.20,000/- as just compensation under the head of Pain and Sufferings. (iv) Transport Charges: The petitioner took treatment as inpatient for 5 days. Hence this Tribunal considering the place of accident and distance to hospital considers to award Rs.3,000/- will be just compensation under the head of Transport Charges. (v) Medical Expenses: The petitioner has not filed any Medical Bills for the treatment taken by him. Hence this "" no amount"" is awarded towards Medical Expenses. (vi) Extra-nourishment: The Petitioner took treatment as Inpatient for 5 days in Government Vellore Medical College Hospital, Vellore. Hence this Tribunal decides to award Rs.10,000/- towards Extra-nourishment. /9/ (vii) Attender Charges: On perusal of records it is fount that t he petitioner took treatment as inpatient for 5 days and hence he is entitled for attender charges and this Tribunal decides to award Rs.1,250/- (5 days x Rs.250/-) towards Attender Charges. (viii) Loss of Earning: The petitioner in his petition and chief proof affidavit stated that he is not able to continue his regular work and not able to continue his work as before the accident because of the injuries sustained by him. But to prove the loss of earning no documentary evidence filed. Due to the above said injuries, the petitioner might not have done his work for at least for 2 months during his treatment period. Hence this Tribunal is inclined to compensate a sum of Rs.16,000/- towards loss of earnings during the period of treatment and recuperation. (ix) Loss of future Prospects: The PW1 has stated that due to the injuries sustained by him , he is not able to continue his Building Iron Rod Construction work and is living without any income. But to prove that the petitioner is not continuing his previous job, no documentary evidence filed. But the petitioner could have suffered some financial loss due to the injuries sustained by him. Hence the petitioner is entitled for any amount towards Loss of future Prospects. But the petitioner has not produced any documentary and oral evidence to prove that due to the injury sustained by the petitioner, his future life is /10/ affected. Hence Rs.20,000/- is awarded towards loss of future prospects. (x) CALCULATION: 1. Disability :Rs. 30,000/- 2. Pain and Sufferings :Rs. 20,000/- 3. Transportation :Rs. 3,000/- 4.

Vetrichelvi, M.L., Motor Accident Claims Tribunal Judge/ I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Vellore. Tuesday, the 31st day of October 2017. M.C.O.P.No. 832/2015 1.Umarani 2.Asha 3.Giridharan 4.Subha .. Petitioners. /Vs/ The Managing Director Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation Vellore. .. Respondent. This petition, coming up for final hearing before me, on 26.10.2017, in the presence of Thiru S.Dhakshinamoorthy, Advocate for the Petitioners and Thiru M.Raju, Advocate for the respondent and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court doth delivereth the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 3. Name of the person dead : Padmanabhan 4. Age of the person dead : 77 years 5. Occupation : Retired Private Company staff and doing real estate business 6. Income pleaded : Rs. 20,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 9.9.2015 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.30,00,000/- 2 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the wife, daughters and son of the deceased Padmanabhan. That on 09.09.2015 at about 1.45 P.M. at Vellore Velapadi turning, opposite to Samy Suppliers, while the deceased was travelling in the Government Bus bearing Reg.No.TN-23-N-1610, owned by the respondent, driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and applied sudden break and as a result, the deceased thrown away from the bus and sustained grievous injury on his head, both ear bleedings and died on the way to hospital. The Vellore South P olice have registered a case in Cr. No. 514/2015, u/s. 279, 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and was a retired private company staff and also doing real estate business and earned Rs.20,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. The deceased was the sole bread winner of the family. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming compensation of Rs.30,00,000/- for the death of Padmanabhan in the accident. 3. THE MATERIAL FACT STATED IN COUNTER OF RESPONDENT:- The petition is not maintainable in law and on facts. The respondent denied all the allegations in the petition. The accident was happened due to the negligence of the deceased and not due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the respondent. The manner of the accident not admitted. The age, income and occupation of the deceased are denied. The relationship of the petitioners with the deceased and claiming of compensation are denied. The amount claimed is excessive. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the respondent ? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner herself examined as PW1. Mr. Ezhilkumar examined as PW2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P.3 marked on the side of the Petitioners. Mr. Vijayakumar, the driver of the respondent examined as RW1 and no documents marked on their side. POINT NO.1 6. It is admitted fact that the Respondent is the owner of the bus bearing Reg.No. TN-23-N-1610 and RW1 was the driving the accident bus at the time of accident. The 3 petitioners contended the accident was happened only due to rash and negligent driving of the RW1. But, the Respondent contended the accident was happened only due to the negligence of the deceased. In this case the accident was admitted and manner of the accident alone disputed. Since, the Respondent denied the manner of accident as pleaded by the claimants, we have to decide whether the Respondent's driver is responsible for the accident and there was any contributory negligence on the part of deceased. 7. The 1st petitioner is the wife of the deceased and examined as P.W.1 and she deposed that on 09.09.2015 at about 1.45 P.M. at Vellore Velapadi turning, opposite to Samy Suppliers, while the deceased was travelling in the Government Bus bearing Reg.No.TN-23-N-1610, driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and applied sudden break and as a result, the deceased thrown away from the bus and sustained grievous injury and died. The P.W.1 not seen the accident and hence her evidence is not sufficient to prove the accident. 8. The P.W.2 examined as occurrence witness. The P.W.2 deposed that 09.09.2015 at about 1.45 P.M. while he was standing in front of Samy suppliers sweet shop after purchasing sweets, the deceased who was travelling in the Government Bus bearing Reg.No.TN-23-N-1610, driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and applied sudden break and as a result, the deceased thrown away from the bus and sustained grievous injury on his head and he sent the injured to the hospital for treatment. In the cross examination he admitted that the house of the deceased is nearby from the accident spot and the deceased was trying to getting down from the bus before it stops. On perusal of the evidence of PW2, it is seen that the deceased also contributed negligence to the accident. The accident was reported to Vellore South P olice and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 514/2015, u/s. 279, 304(A) of IPC and the respondent's driver. The driver of the respondent examined as RW1 and he deposed that the accident was happened only due to the negligence of the deceased. But in the cross examination he admitted that after investigation the police have filed charge sheet against him and the case is pending. The perusal of PW2 evidence, it is proved the deceased also contributed negligence to the accident. Hence, it is decided the deceased also contributed negligence to the accident. Considering the Respondent's bus was heavy vehicle and the deceased was a passenger in the bus, it is decided the Respondent's driver contributed 80% and the deceased contributed 20% of negligence to the accident. 4 Point No.2: 9. The 1st petitioner is the wife, 2 to 4 petitioners are the daughters and son of the deceased. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased Padmanabhan and wherein the doctor opined that the deceased was died due to head injury. 10. It is already decided the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of Respondent driver. The Ex.P2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only because of the injuries caused in the accident. Hence, the Respondent is liable to pay compensation to the claimants. AGE 11. The claimants not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of deceased person. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 77 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report also the approximate age of deceased was recorded as 77 years. Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximate age recorded in Ex.P.2 Postmortem report treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 77 years at the time of accident. INCOME 12. The petitioners claimed Rs.30,00,000/- as compensation. The PW1 deposed that the deceased was a retired private company staff and also doing real estate business and earned Rs.20,000/- per month. There was no evidence to show the income proof. Considering there was no proof for income and considering the age and the deceased was a retired private company staff which is also evidenced from Ex.P1 FIR , this Tribunal has fixed the monthly income of deceased person as Rs.9,000/- per month. Deductions: 13. There are 4 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/4th of income towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/4th deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs. 6750/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 14. Considering the age of the deceased is 77 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 5 is adopted for calculation of 5 compensation. Therefore the compensation calculated to Rs. 6750 x 12 x 5 = Rs. 4,05,000/- and therefore the petitioners are entitled Rs.4,05,000/- as compensation towards loss of income. FUTURE PROSPECTS 15. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. In this case the age of the deceased is 77 years and hence future prospects is not applicable for this case. 16. It is already decided the Respondent has to pay 80% of compensation to the claimants. Since the deceased contributed 20% of negligence to accident, the petitioners has to bear the 20% of compensation. The 80% of compensation payable by the Respondents is arrived to Rs. 3,24,000/- to the claimants. 17. That apart, this Tribunal awarded Rs. 25,000/- towards loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner and Rs.10,000/- is awarded to each of the petitioners 1 to 4 and in total Rs.40,000/- awarded towards love and affection and Rs. 15,000/- is awarded towards funeral expenses and Rs.5,000/- towards transport expenses. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 3,24,000.00 2.Loss of consortium ...Rs. 25,000.00 3.Funeral Expenses ...Rs. 15,000.00 4.Love and affection ...Rs. 40,000.00 5.Transport expenses ...Rs. 5,000.00 ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 4,09,000.00 ------------------------ 18. In the result, this petition is partly allowed with costs and the petitioners are entitled for Rs. 4,09,000/- (Rupees Four Lakhs and nine thousand only) as compensation. The respondent is directed to pay and deposit the award amount into this court within 4 weeks from this day with interest at 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this petition (08.10.2005) till the date of deposit excluding th default period if any.

That on 09.09.2015 at about 1.45 P.M. at Vellore Velapadi turning, opposite to Samy Suppliers, while the deceased was travelling in the Government Bus bearing Reg.No.TN-23-N-1610, owned by the respondent, driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and applied sudden break and as a result, the deceased thrown away from the bus and sustained grievous injury on his head, both ear bleedings and died on the way to hospital. The Vellore South P olice have registered a case in Cr. No. 514/2015, u/s. 279, 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and was a retired private company staff and also doing real estate business and earned Rs.20,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. The deceased was the sole bread winner of the family. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming compensation of Rs.30,00,000/- for the death of Padmanabhan in the accident. 3. THE MATERIAL FACT STATED IN COUNTER OF RESPONDENT:- The petition is not maintainable in law and on facts. The respondent denied all the allegations in the petition. The accident was happened due to the negligence of the deceased and not due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the respondent. The manner of the accident not admitted. The age, income and occupation of the deceased are denied. The relationship of the petitioners with the deceased and claiming of compensation are denied. The amount claimed is excessive. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the respondent ? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner herself examined as PW1. Mr. Ezhilkumar examined as PW2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P.3 marked on the side of the Petitioners. Mr. Vijayakumar, the driver of the respondent examined as RW1 and no documents marked on their side. POINT NO.1 6. It is admitted fact that the Respondent is the owner of the bus bearing Reg.No. TN-23-N-1610 and RW1 was the driving the accident bus at the time of accident. The 3 petitioners contended the accident was happened only due to rash and negligent driving of the RW1. But, the Respondent contended the accident was happened only due to the negligence of the deceased. In this case the accident was admitted and manner of the accident alone disputed. Since, the Respondent denied the manner of accident as pleaded by the claimants, we have to decide whether the Respondent's driver is responsible for the accident and there was any contributory negligence on the part of deceased. 7. The 1st petitioner is the wife of the deceased and examined as P.W.1 and she deposed that on 09.09.2015 at about 1.45 P.M. at Vellore Velapadi turning, opposite to Samy Suppliers, while the deceased was travelling in the Government Bus bearing Reg.No.TN-23-N-1610, driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and applied sudden break and as a result, the deceased thrown away from the bus and sustained grievous injury and died. The P.W.1 not seen the accident and hence her evidence is not sufficient to prove the accident. 8. The P.W.2 examined as occurrence witness. The P.W.2 deposed that 09.09.2015 at about 1.45 P.M. while he was standing in front of Samy suppliers sweet shop after purchasing sweets, the deceased who was travelling in the Government Bus bearing Reg.No.TN-23-N-1610, driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and applied sudden break and as a result, the deceased thrown away from the bus and sustained grievous injury on his head and he sent the injured to the hospital for treatment. In the cross examination he admitted that the house of the deceased is nearby from the accident spot and the deceased was trying to getting down from the bus before it stops. On perusal of the evidence of PW2, it is seen that the deceased also contributed negligence to the accident. The accident was reported to Vellore South P olice and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 514/2015, u/s. 279, 304(A) of IPC and the respondent's driver. The driver of the respondent examined as RW1 and he deposed that the accident was happened only due to the negligence of the deceased. But in the cross examination he admitted that after investigation the police have filed charge sheet against him and the case is pending. The perusal of PW2 evidence, it is proved the deceased also contributed negligence to the accident. Hence, it is decided the deceased also contributed negligence to the accident. Considering the Respondent's bus was heavy vehicle and the deceased was a passenger in the bus, it is decided the Respondent's driver contributed 80% and the deceased contributed 20% of negligence to the accident. 4 Point No.2: 9. The 1st petitioner is the wife, 2 to 4 petitioners are the daughters and son of the deceased. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased Padmanabhan and wherein the doctor opined that the deceased was died due to head injury. 10. It is already decided the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of Respondent driver. The Ex.P2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only because of the injuries caused in the accident. Hence, the Respondent is liable to pay compensation to the claimants. AGE 11. The claimants not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of deceased person. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 77 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report also the approximate age of deceased was recorded as 77 years. Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximate age recorded in Ex.P.2 Postmortem report treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 77 years at the time of accident. INCOME 12. The petitioners claimed Rs.30,00,000/- as compensation. The PW1 deposed that the deceased was a retired private company staff and also doing real estate business and earned Rs.20,000/- per month. There was no evidence to show the income proof. Considering there was no proof for income and considering the age and the deceased was a retired private company staff which is also evidenced from Ex.P1 FIR , this Tribunal has fixed the monthly income of deceased person as Rs.9,000/- per month. Deductions: 13. There are 4 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/4th of income towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/4th deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs. 6750/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 14. Considering the age of the deceased is 77 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 5 is adopted for calculation of 5 compensation. Therefore the compensation calculated to Rs. 6750 x 12 x 5 = Rs. 4,05,000/- and therefore the petitioners are entitled Rs.4,05,000/- as compensation towards loss of income. FUTURE PROSPECTS 15. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. In this case the age of the deceased is 77 years and hence future prospects is not applicable for this case. 16. It is already decided the Respondent has to pay 80% of compensation to the claimants. Since the deceased contributed 20% of negligence to accident, the petitioners has to bear the 20% of compensation. The 80% of compensation payable by the Respondents is arrived to Rs. 3,24,000/- to the claimants. 17. That apart, this Tribunal awarded Rs. 25,000/- towards loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner and Rs.10,000/- is awarded to each of the petitioners 1 to 4 and in total Rs.40,000/- awarded towards love and affection and Rs. 15,000/- is awarded towards funeral expenses and Rs.5,000/- towards transport expenses. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 3,24,000.00 2.Loss of consortium ...Rs. 25,000.00 3.Funeral Expenses ...Rs. 15,000.00 4.Love and affection ...Rs. 40,000.00 5.Transport expenses ...Rs. 5,000.00 ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 4,09,000.00 ------------------------ 18. In the result, this petition is partly allowed with costs and the petitioners are entitled for Rs. 4,09,000/- (Rupees Four Lakhs and nine thousand only) as compensation. The respondent is directed to pay and deposit the award amount into this court within 4 weeks from this day with interest at 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this petition (08.10.2005) till the date of deposit excluding th default period if any.

The Ex.P2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only because of the injuries caused in the accident. Hence, the Respondent is liable to pay compensation to the claimants. AGE 11. The claimants not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of deceased person. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 77 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report also the approximate age of deceased was recorded as 77 years. Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximate age recorded in Ex.P.2 Postmortem report treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 77 years at the time of accident. INCOME 12. The petitioners claimed Rs.30,00,000/- as compensation. The PW1 deposed that the deceased was a retired private company staff and also doing real estate business and earned Rs.20,000/- per month. There was no evidence to show the income proof. Considering there was no proof for income and considering the age and the deceased was a retired private company staff which is also evidenced from Ex.P1 FIR , this Tribunal has fixed the monthly income of deceased person as Rs.9,000/- per month. Deductions: 13. There are 4 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/4th of income towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/4th deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs. 6750/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 14. Considering the age of the deceased is 77 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 5 is adopted for calculation of 5 compensation. Therefore the compensation calculated to Rs. 6750 x 12 x 5 = Rs. 4,05,000/- and therefore the petitioners are entitled Rs.4,05,000/- as compensation towards loss of income. FUTURE PROSPECTS 15. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. In this case the age of the deceased is 77 years and hence future prospects is not applicable for this case. 16. It is already decided the Respondent has to pay 80% of compensation to the claimants. Since the deceased contributed 20% of negligence to accident, the petitioners has to bear the 20% of compensation. The 80% of compensation payable by the Respondents is arrived to Rs. 3,24,000/- to the claimants. 17. That apart, this Tribunal awarded Rs. 25,000/- towards loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner and Rs.10,000/- is awarded to each of the petitioners 1 to 4 and in total Rs.40,000/- awarded towards love and affection and Rs. 15,000/- is awarded towards funeral expenses and Rs.5,000/- towards transport expenses. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 3,24,000.00 2.Loss of consortium ...Rs. 25,000.00 3.Funeral Expenses ...Rs. 15,000.00 4.Love and affection ...Rs. 40,000.00 5.Transport expenses ...Rs. 5,000.00 ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 4,09,000.00 ------------------------ 18. In the result, this petition is partly allowed with costs and the petitioners are entitled for Rs. 4,09,000/- (Rupees Four Lakhs and nine thousand only) as compensation. The respondent is directed to pay and deposit the award amount into this court within 4 weeks from this day with interest at 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this petition (08.10.2005) till the date of deposit excluding th default period if any.

5rlvflkps77kv2djpfn1hnaek0 (35).pdf,"1 BEFORE THE MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, VELLORE, VELLORE DISTRICT. (I ADDITIONAL DISTRICT AND SESSIONS COURT, VELLORE.) Present: Thiru S. Natarajan, B.Sc., B.L., I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Vellore. Tuesday, the 10th day of January, 2017. M.C.O.P.No. 524/2015 1. Vijayakumari @ Kumari 2. Sekar .. Petitioners. /Vs/ 1. Bala @ Balakrishnan `2. The Divisional Manager, United India Insurance Co. Ltd., .. Respondents. This petition, coming up for final hearing before me, on 20.12.2016, in the presence of Thiru.S.Dakshinamoorthy, Advocate for the Petitioners and Thiru. L. Pandurangan, counsel for the 2nd respondent and the 1st Respondent remained absent and set exparte and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court doth delivereth the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 3. Name of deceased Person : Venkatesh Prasad @ Venkata Prasad 4. Age of the person dead : 18 years 5. Occupation : Plus 2 student 6. Income pleaded : Rs.NIL 7. Date of Accident : 3.3.2015 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.25,00,000/- 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the parents of the deceased Venkatesh Prasad who died in a road accident. That on 3.3.2015, at about 8.40 A.M, while the deceased was riding two wheeler in a slow and careful manner on left side of the road at Vellore Nathaji Stadium road, near police quarters, the 2 bus bearing Regn.No. TN-23-AR-9099, owned by the 1st respondent was driven by its driver Mr. Sivagnanam in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and as a result of the accident the deceased sustained head injury and grievous injuries all over the body and immediately taken to Government Hospital at Vellore and subsequently died. The accident was reported to Vellore South Police and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 129/2015, u/s. 279 & 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was studying +2 and he was very brilliant student and due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs.25,00,000/- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 2nd RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. The 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in slow and careful manner following all traffic rules. But the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler by the deceased and not due to the rash driving of the driver of the 1st respondent. The deceased also contribute negligence to the accident. The 1st Respondent's driver has no valid driving licence to drive the vehicle involved in the accident and it was violation of terms of Insurance policy and hence this Respondent is not liable to pay the compensation amount. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent? 2. Whether the claimant is entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner examined as PW1 and Mr. Baskar examined as PW2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P.7 marked on the side of the Petitioners. No oral and documentary evidence for the 2nd Respondent. POINT NO.1 6. It is admitted fact that the 1st Respondent is the owner of the bus bearing Reg.No. TN- 23-AR-9099 which involved in the accident and Mr. Sivagnanam was the driver of the offending vehicle at the time of accident. The petitioner contended the 1st Respondent's 3 driver drove the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler ridden by the deceased. But, the 2nd Respondent contended that the 1st Respondent's driver drove the bus in a slow and careful manner and the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler by the deceased. The offending vehicle was inspected by the MVI and issued the Ex.P.4 M.V.I. report stating the tyre condition was satisfactory and the Breaking system was in order and there was no mechanical defect in the offending vehicle. Since, the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident as pleaded by the claimants and there was no mechanical defect in the offending vehicle, we have to decide whether the 1st Respondent's driver is responsible for the accident and there was any contributory negligence on the part of deceased. 7. The P.W.1 deposed that on 3.3.2015 at about 8.40 A.M, while the deceased was riding two wheeler bearing Reg.No.TN-09-AS-9513 in slow and careful manner on the left side at Vellore Nathaji Stadium road, near police quarters, the bus bearing Regn.No. TN- 23-AR-9099, owned by the 1st respondent was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and as a result of the accident the deceased sustained head injury and grievous injuries all over the body and immediately taken to Government Hospital at Vellore and subsequently died. The P.W.1 not seen the accident directly and hence the P.W.1 evidence is not sufficient to prove the manner of accident. 8. The P.W. 2 examined as occurrence witness and he deposed that on 3.3.2015 at about 8.40 A.M, when the deceased riding two wheeler bearing Reg.No.TN-09-AS-9513 in slow and careful manner on the left side at Vellore Nathaji Stadium road, near police quarters, from the opposite direction the bus bearing Regn.No. TN-23-AR-9099, was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and as a result of the accident the deceased sustained head injury and grievous injuries all over the body and immediately taken to Government Hospital at Vellore and subsequently died. The P.W. 2 denied the suggestion that he has not seen the accident directly. 9. The accident was reported to Vellore South police station and they have registered a case in Cr.No. 129/2015 for offence u/s 279 & 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and wherein also it was stated the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. The 2nd Respondent contended the deceased also contributed negligence to the accident. The contributory negligence is a sharing of responsibility for damage where a person suffers 4 damage as a result partly of his own fault and partly of the fault of any other person. The 2nd Respondent has not put the 1st Respondent's driver into the witness box to state as to how accident occurred and to depose that he was not at fault and was not driving the vehicle in rash and negligent manner or to prove the allegations of contributory negligence. The P.W.2 evidence proved the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st Respondent's driver. The 2nd Respondent not proved the contributory negligence against the deceased. Hence it is decided the 1st Respondent's driver drove the offending bus in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. Point No.2: 10. The petitioners are the parents of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.3 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein the Doctor noted the following External Injuries:- 1. Grazed abrasion left side of chest, abdomen, hip and thigh (front) 2. Grazed abrasion back of thighs 3. Contused laceration right loin 4. Fracture deformity of right lower limb The Doctor also noted the following Internal Injuries:- 1. Plural Cavities: Empty 2. Heart: Normal, chambers empty, coronaries : Patent 3. Lungs: Pale 4. Hyoid Bone: Intact 5. Stomach: contains 150 ml of digested cooked rice food particles with nil smell 6. Mucosa: Pale 7. Small Intestine: Nil 8. Liver and Spleen: Pale 9. Bladder : Empty 10. Brain: Edematous The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries. 11. It is already decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in the accident. The 1st Respondent insured the vehicle with the 2nd Respondent and the insurance was in force on the date of 5 accident and this fact was proved through Ex.P.7 copy of Insurance Policy certificate. The 1st Respondent's driver also has valid driving license to drive the offending vehicle with badge endorsement at the time of accident and this fact was proved from entries in Ex.P.4 MVI report and also from the Ex.P.6 the Xerox copy driving license of 1st Respondent's driver. Hence, the Respondents are liable to pay compensation to the claimants. AGE 12. The deceased was studying + 2 standard at the time of accident. The Ex.P. 5 is the xerox copy of the school transfer certificate and wherein the date of birth of the deceased was mentioned as 6.2.1998 and it proved the correct age of deceased was 17 years, 27 days and hence the age deceased was fixed at 18 years at the time of accident. INCOME 13. The petitioners claimed Rs.25,00,000/- as compensation. The deceased was +2 student and he was non earing member at the time of accident. The deceased was studying XII th standard at the time of accident. In the ruling reported in The New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs Bal Kishan Pawar & Ors. on 31 May, 2012, https://indiankanoon.org/doc/193748239/ , the notional income of XII standard student was fixed to Rs. 15,000/- and at para 13 of judgment the Hon'ble Delhi High Court decided as follows:- 13. In the present case, the deceased was a very bright student of 12th standard and had submitted an application for National Defence Academy (NDA) Examination on 24th June, 1992. The acknowledgment card of the said application has been proved as Ex.PW1/7. Upon successful passing of the said examination, the deceased would have joined the defence services as Second Lieutenant with a salary of `15,000/- per month and would have retired with a minimum salary of `35,000/- per month. In United India Insurance Co. v. Kanwar Lal (supra), the deceased aged 18 years, was a student of XIIth standard and was ambitious to become MBA/C.A. whereas in National Insurance Company Limited v. Gaje Singh (supra), the deceased aged 11 years, was a student of Vth standard and was ambitious to become an engineer. In both the aforesaid cases, the ambition of the deceased had not taken shape and this Court assumed the income of `10,800/- following the judgment of the Supreme Court in Municipal Corporation of 6 Delhi v. Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (supra). However, in the present case, the deceased aged 17 years, was a brilliant student of XIIth standard and his ambition to join the defense services was taking shape as the deceased had applied for the NDA examination on 24th June, 1992 but his unfortunate accident snatched away his life before he could appear in the examination. The parents of the deceased successfully proved that upon selection in NDA examination, the deceased would have joined the defense services as Second Lieutenant at a salary of `15,000/- per month and would have retired as Lieutenant Colonel at a minimum salary of `35,000/- per month. In view of the clear evidence on record, it is safe to draw a presumption that the deceased would have earned atleast `15,000/- per month. Following the judgment of the Supreme Court in Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (supra) and of this Court in United India Insurance Company Limited v. Kanwar Lal (supra) and National Insurance Company Limited v. Gaje Singh (supra), the income of the deceased is taken to be `15,000/- per month. In the above referred case it was evidenced that the deceased was a student of 12th standard in a reputed school of Delhi with ambition to become MBA decree holder. In this case the P.W.1 just deposed the deceased was brilliant student and there was no evidence for the ambition of the deceased and more over the evidence regarding the status of school wherein the deceased was studying XII Standard. Considering these aspects, this tribunal fixed the notional income of deceased at Rs.10,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 14. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. Recently in a ruling reported in in Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (2) TNMAC 55(SC): 2013 (9) SCC 54 , it was decided future prospects applicable in a case of self-employed persons also. The annual income of the deceased was Rs.10,000x12 = Rs. 1,20,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age 7 of deceased was 18 years at the time of accident, 50% of income added towards future prospects and the monthly income arrived to Rs. 10,000 + 5000 = 15,000/-. Deductions: 15. The deceased was bachelor at the time of accident. There are 2 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted ½ of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After ½ deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs. 7500/- per month. MULTIPLIER FOR BACHELOR 16. The Honourable Supreme Court in the decision in Amirt Bhanu Shali vs. National Insurance Co. Ltd . (2012 (2) TN MAC 321 (SC)) has held as follows: The selection of Multiplier is based on the age of the deceased and not on the basis of the age of dependent. There may be a number of dependents of the deceased whose age may be different and, therefore, the age of dependents has no nexus with the computation of compensation As per the above dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court , the age of the deceased considered for fixing the multiplier. Since the deceased 18 years of age at the time of accident as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 18 is adopted for calculation of “loss of dependency” to the family and arrived to Rs. 7500X12x18 =Rs.16,20,000/-. COMPENSATION FOR LOVE AND AFFECTION 17. In Asha Verman -Vs- Maharaj Singh, 2015(1) TN MAC 465 (SC), it is held in para 18, that each children entitled at Rs. 1,00,000/- towards love and affection and each parents are entitled at Rs. 50,000/-. The petitioners are the parents of the deceased and they have lost their love & affection of the deceased and it is not measurable by money. However, a small amount of Rs.1,00,000/- is considered in the lumpsum calculation towards love and affection. Funeral Expenses : 18. Decent burial is also one on the right under Art 21 of our constitution, The petitioner has failed to produced any expenditure statement relating to the funeral 8 expenses, so the tribunal has awarded a minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- for the head, also relied the Judgment in Rajesh v. Rajbir singh [CDJ 2013 SC 485], the Hon’ble apex court has further held that “ Funeral expenses not only includes fee paid in crematorium or cementary but also includes religious practices and conventions performed on death in family. Hence in absence of any evidence to contrary, minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- to be awarded by Courts towards funeral expenses ”. Hence, a sum of Rs,25,000/- alone was considered and fixed the award in lumpsum manner. Loss of Estate, Transport Expenses and damages for articles:- 19. This Tribunal considered future prospects and 50% of income added towards future prospects. Hence, this Tribunal not awarded any under the head of Loss of Estate. The petitioner not produced any documentary evidence showing the actual expenses for transport expenses. However, this Tribunal awarded Rs. 5000/- towards transport expenses. The petitioners not accounted for the actual damages caused in accident. Hence, this Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs. 2000/- towards damage to clothes and articles. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 16,20,000/- 2.Loss of consortium ...Rs. NIL 3.Loss of Love & Affection …Rs. 1,00,000/- 4.Loss of estate ...Rs NIL 5.Medical Expenses …Rs. NIL 6.Funeral expenses ...Rs. 25,000/- 7.Transport expenses ...Rs. 5,000/- 8.Damages to cloths and articles ...Rs. 2,000/- ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 17,52,000/- ------------------------ 20. In the result, this petition is partly allowed with costs and the petitioners are entitled for Rs. 17,52,000/- (Rupees Seventeen Lakhs Fifty two Thousand only) as compensation. The 2nd respondents is directed to pay and deposit the award amount into this court within 4 weeks from this day with interest at 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this petition (9.4.2015) till the date of deposit. The 2nd respondent is directed to deposit the award amount through NEFT or RTGE mode in the account of FIRST ADDITIONAL DISTRICT COURT, MACT, Vellore in Account No. 35965368047 (IFSC 9 Code SBIN0008688) of SBI, Sathuvachari Branch, Vellore, under intimation to this court and claimants. The petitioners are the parents of the deceased and entitled to get award amount equally. In the first instance, the petitioners are ordered to receive 50% along with entire interest accrued thereupon on it and costs; The remaining share of the petitioners are ordered to be deposited in any one of the nationalized Bank for a period of not less than three years.

On perusal of the Ex-P1 F.I.R., it is proved that the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent riding of the rider, the 1st respondent herein. No contra evidence on the side of the respondent to disprove the petitioners' case. Considering the evidence of P.W.1 and the Ex-P1 F.I.R., it is decided that the accident was only due to the rash and negligent riding of the rider, the respondent. This point is answered accordingly.

Recently in a ruling reported in in Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (2) TNMAC 55(SC): 2013 (9) SCC 54 , it was decided future prospects applicable in a case of self-employed persons also. The annual income of the deceased was Rs. 6,000x 12= Rs.72,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased as 38 years, 50% of income added towards future prospects and the monthly income arrived to Rs.6000+3000=9,000/-. Deductions: 11. There are 4 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/4th of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/4th deduction ( 9000 – 2250 = 6750) the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs. 6750/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 12. Considering the age of the deceased is 38 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 15 is adopted for calculation of compensation.

COMPENSATION FOR CONSORTIUM AND LOVE AND AFFECTION CONSORTUM 5 13. The 1st petitioner is the wife of deceased Sankar. In Rajesh v.

Rajbir singh [CDJ 2013 SC 485], the Hon’ble apex court has further held that “ Funeral expenses not only includes fee paid in crematorium or cementary but also includes religious practices and conventions performed on death in family. Hence in absence of any evidence to contrary, minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- to be awarded by Courts towards funeral expenses ”. Hence, a sum of Rs,25,000/- alone was considered and fixed the award in lumpsum manner. 16. This Tribunal considered future prospects and 50% of income added towards future prospects. Hence, this Tribunal not awarded any amount under this head. The petitioners have not produced any documentary evidence showing the actual expenses for 6 transport expenses. However, this Tribunal awarded Rs. 5000/- towards transport expenses. The petitioners have not accounted for the actual damages caused in accident.

This petition, coming up for final hearing before this Tribunal, on 28.11.2016, in the presence of Thiru.M.L. Jambukumar, J. Vinothkumar & J. Dhineshkumar, Advocates for the Petitioners and Thiru. R.J.Mohan, counsel for the 2nd respondent and the 1st Respondent remained absent and set exparte and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court doth delivereth the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 3. Name of deceased Person : V. Mahendran 4. Age of the person dead : 40 years 5. Occupation : Beedi Worker 6. Income pleaded : Rs.10,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 20.10.2014 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.20,00,000/- 2 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the wife, sons and parents of the deceased Mahendran who died in a road accident. That on 20.10.2014 at about 3.30 P.M. while the deceased was riding his bicycle on Katpadi to Gudiyatham road, returning from Vikramasi Village to house, on the eastern side of the road, the lorry bearing Regn.No. TN-25-T-1569, owned by the 1st respondent was driven by its driver Mr. Baskaran in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the bicycle of the deceased and as a result of the accident the deceased sustained grievous injury on all over the body and immediately he was taken to Government Hospital at Vellore and subsequently died on 24.10.2014. The accident was reported to K.V. Kuppam P olice and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 363/2014, u/s. 279, 337, 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and doing Beedi Work and earned Rs. 10,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners has filed this petition claiming Rs.20,00,000/- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 2nd RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. The 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in slow and careful manner following all traffic rules. But the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent act of the deceased and not due to the rash driving of the driver of the 1st respondent. The deceased also contribute negligence to the accident. The 1st Respondent's driver has no valid driving license to drive the vehicle involved in the accident and it was violation of terms of Insurance policy and hence this Respondent is not liable to pay the compensation amount. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent ? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner examined as PW1 and Mr. Mohan examined as PW2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P. 4 marked on the side of the Petitioners. No oral and documentary evidence for the 2nd Respondent. 3 POINT NO.1 6. It is admitted fact that the 1st Respondent is the owner of the lorry bearing Reg.No. TN-25-T-1569 and one Baskaran was drove the offending vehicle at the time of accident. The petitioner contended that while the deceased riding bicycle, the 1st Respondent's driver drove the offending vehicle in a rash and negligence manner and dashed against the deceased. But, the 2nd Respondent contended that the 1st Respondent's driver drove the lorry in slow and careful manner and the accident was happened due to the rash and negligence of the deceased. Since, the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident pleaded by the claimants, we have to decide whether the 1st Respondent's driver is responsible for the accident and there was any contributory negligence on the part of deceased. 7. The P.W.1 deposed that on 20.10.2014 at about 3.00 P.M, after the work, while the deceased returning to house from Vikramasi Village to house by riding his bicycle on Katpadi to Gudiyatham road, proceeding from east to west direction, the 1st Respondent's driver drove the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. The PW1 not seen the accident directly and hence the P.W.1 evidence has no use to prove the manner of accident. The P.W. 2 examined as occurrence witness and he deposed that on 20.10.2014 at the time of accident he also riding bicycle towards Vaduganthangal and at that time the deceased coming in opposite direction in a bicycle and at that time the 1st Respondent's driver drove the offending vehicle from East to west direction in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and so that he sustained fatal injury. The accident was reported to K.V. Kuppam police station and they have registered case in Cr.No. 363/2014 for offence u/s 279, 337, 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and wherein also it was stated the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. After investigation the police have filed the charge sheet against the 1st Respondent's driver and this fact was proved through Ex.P. 3 copy of charge sheet. The 2nd Respondent has not put the 1st Respondent's driver into the witness box to state as to how accident occurred and to depose that he was not at fault and was not driving the vehicle in rash and negligent manner or that no accident occurred with the vehicle of 1st respondent. Hence it is decided the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. 4 Point No.2: 8. The 1st petitioner is the wife, 2nd and 3rd petitioners are sons and 4th and 5th petitioners are parents of deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P4 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein the Doctor noted the following External Injuries:- 1. Sutured wound (6 sutures) present on the posterior aspects of scalp right occipital region. 2. Abrasions of varying sizes seen on the chest, abdomen, both arms and both Legs. The Doctor also noted the following Internal Injuries:- 1. Diffuse Sub-Scalpal contusion on the occipital region. 2. There is linear fracture from right to left occipital region. 3. There is marked organized subdural and subarachnoid Hemorrhage both cerebral hemispheres. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died of complication of head injury sustained. 9. It is already decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased sustained fatal injury on his head and died on 24.10.2014. The first Respondent insured the vehicle with the 2nd Respondent and the insurance was in force on the date of accident. There was no contra evidence to show the 1st Respondent lorry not insured with the 2nd Respondent. Hence, the Respondents are liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. AGE 10. The claimants not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of the deceased person. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 40 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report also the approximate age of deceased mentioned as 40 years. Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximate age recorded in Ex.P.2 Postmortem Certificate accepted as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 40 years at the time of accident. 5 REIMBURSEMENT OF MEDICAL BILLS:- 11. Immediate to accident the deceased taken to Government Hospital, Vellore and admitted on 20.10.2014 and he was inpatient till his death on 24.10.2014. But, the petitioners not produced any Bills for medical expenses. Hence, no amount was awarded under this head. INCOME 12. The petitioners claimed Rs.20,00,000/- as compensation. The P.W. 1 deposed the deceased was working as a Beedi Worker at the time of accident and earned Rs. 10,000/- per month. There was no evidence to show the proof for occupation and income. The socio-economic condition forced to any individual to earn at the rate of Rs.300/- per day for his living. This court also consider the citation in APSRTC Ltd -Vs- Bharatahy & others, 2015(3) TNLJ 182 (CIVIL), in para 8 it is decided the daily income of carpenter assessed by the Tribunal at Rs. 300/- per day and monthly income of Rs. 9,000/- was not high. In the ruling reported in Managing Director, TNSTC vs Thahira & 3 others, 2016 (2) TNMAC 611 also it is held the notional income fixed by tribunal at Rs. 9,000/- was not excessive. Considering the above legal position , this Tribunal has fixed the monthly income of deceased person as Rs.9,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 13. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. Recently in a ruling reported in in Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (2) TNMAC 55(SC): 2013 (9) SCC 54 , it was decided future prospects applicable in a case of self-employed persons also. In the subsequent ruling reported in State Express Transport Crop Ltd vs D.Malliga, 2016 (1) TNMAC 309 (DB), it is decided the future prospects applicable to persons aged beyond 50 years and in case of self employed or on fixed wages, where there is no age of superannuation, 15% of income can be added towards future prospects for the persons in group of 50 – 60 years. The 6 annual income of the deceased was Rs. 9,000x12=1,08,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased was 40 years at the time of accident, 50% of income added towards future prospects and the annual income arrived to Rs. 108000+54000=162000/-. Deductions: 14.

After 1/4th deduction the annual income of the deceased fixed as Rs.162000 – 40,500 = 121500/- per Annum. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 15. Considering the age of the deceased is 40 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 15 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore the compensation calculated to Rs.121500x15x=Rs18,22,500/- and therefore the petitioners are entitled Rs.18,22,500/- as compensation towards loss of income.

This petition, coming up for final hearing before this Tribunal, on 28.11.2016, in the presence of Thiru.M.L. Jambukumar, J. Vinothkumar & J. Dhineshkumar, Advocates for the Petitioners and Thiru. R.J.Mohan, counsel for the 2nd respondent and the 1st Respondent remained absent and set exparte and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court doth delivereth the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 3. Name of deceased Person : V. Mahendran 4. Age of the person dead : 40 years 5. Occupation : Beedi Worker 6. Income pleaded : Rs.10,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 20.10.2014 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.20,00,000/- 2 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the wife, sons and parents of the deceased Mahendran who died in a road accident. That on 20.10.2014 at about 3.30 P.M. while the deceased was riding his bicycle on Katpadi to Gudiyatham road, returning from Vikramasi Village to house, on the eastern side of the road, the lorry bearing Regn.No. TN-25-T-1569, owned by the 1st respondent was driven by its driver Mr. Baskaran in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the bicycle of the deceased and as a result of the accident the deceased sustained grievous injury on all over the body and immediately he was taken to Government Hospital at Vellore and subsequently died on 24.10.2014. The accident was reported to K.V. Kuppam P olice and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 363/2014, u/s. 279, 337, 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and doing Beedi Work and earned Rs. 10,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners has filed this petition claiming Rs.20,00,000/- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 2nd RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. The 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in slow and careful manner following all traffic rules. But the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent act of the deceased and not due to the rash driving of the driver of the 1st respondent. The deceased also contribute negligence to the accident. The 1st Respondent's driver has no valid driving license to drive the vehicle involved in the accident and it was violation of terms of Insurance policy and hence this Respondent is not liable to pay the compensation amount. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent ? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner examined as PW1 and Mr. Mohan examined as PW2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P. 4 marked on the side of the Petitioners. No oral and documentary evidence for the 2nd Respondent. 3 POINT NO.1 6. It is admitted fact that the 1st Respondent is the owner of the lorry bearing Reg.No. TN-25-T-1569 and one Baskaran was drove the offending vehicle at the time of accident. The petitioner contended that while the deceased riding bicycle, the 1st Respondent's driver drove the offending vehicle in a rash and negligence manner and dashed against the deceased. But, the 2nd Respondent contended that the 1st Respondent's driver drove the lorry in slow and careful manner and the accident was happened due to the rash and negligence of the deceased. Since, the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident pleaded by the claimants, we have to decide whether the 1st Respondent's driver is responsible for the accident and there was any contributory negligence on the part of deceased. 7. The P.W.1 deposed that on 20.10.2014 at about 3.00 P.M, after the work, while the deceased returning to house from Vikramasi Village to house by riding his bicycle on Katpadi to Gudiyatham road, proceeding from east to west direction, the 1st Respondent's driver drove the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. The PW1 not seen the accident directly and hence the P.W.1 evidence has no use to prove the manner of accident. The P.W. 2 examined as occurrence witness and he deposed that on 20.10.2014 at the time of accident he also riding bicycle towards Vaduganthangal and at that time the deceased coming in opposite direction in a bicycle and at that time the 1st Respondent's driver drove the offending vehicle from East to west direction in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and so that he sustained fatal injury. The accident was reported to K.V. Kuppam police station and they have registered case in Cr.No. 363/2014 for offence u/s 279, 337, 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and wherein also it was stated the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. After investigation the police have filed the charge sheet against the 1st Respondent's driver and this fact was proved through Ex.P. 3 copy of charge sheet. The 2nd Respondent has not put the 1st Respondent's driver into the witness box to state as to how accident occurred and to depose that he was not at fault and was not driving the vehicle in rash and negligent manner or that no accident occurred with the vehicle of 1st respondent. Hence it is decided the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. 4 Point No.2: 8. The 1st petitioner is the wife, 2nd and 3rd petitioners are sons and 4th and 5th petitioners are parents of deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P4 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein the Doctor noted the following External Injuries:- 1. Sutured wound (6 sutures) present on the posterior aspects of scalp right occipital region. 2. Abrasions of varying sizes seen on the chest, abdomen, both arms and both Legs. The Doctor also noted the following Internal Injuries:- 1. Diffuse Sub-Scalpal contusion on the occipital region. 2. There is linear fracture from right to left occipital region. 3. There is marked organized subdural and subarachnoid Hemorrhage both cerebral hemispheres. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died of complication of head injury sustained. 9. It is already decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased sustained fatal injury on his head and died on 24.10.2014. The first Respondent insured the vehicle with the 2nd Respondent and the insurance was in force on the date of accident. There was no contra evidence to show the 1st Respondent lorry not insured with the 2nd Respondent. Hence, the Respondents are liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. AGE 10. The claimants not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of the deceased person. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 40 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report also the approximate age of deceased mentioned as 40 years. Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximate age recorded in Ex.P.2 Postmortem Certificate accepted as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 40 years at the time of accident. 5 REIMBURSEMENT OF MEDICAL BILLS:- 11. Immediate to accident the deceased taken to Government Hospital, Vellore and admitted on 20.10.2014 and he was inpatient till his death on 24.10.2014. But, the petitioners not produced any Bills for medical expenses. Hence, no amount was awarded under this head. INCOME 12. The petitioners claimed Rs.20,00,000/- as compensation. The P.W. 1 deposed the deceased was working as a Beedi Worker at the time of accident and earned Rs. 10,000/- per month. There was no evidence to show the proof for occupation and income. The socio-economic condition forced to any individual to earn at the rate of Rs.300/- per day for his living. This court also consider the citation in APSRTC Ltd -Vs- Bharatahy & others, 2015(3) TNLJ 182 (CIVIL), in para 8 it is decided the daily income of carpenter assessed by the Tribunal at Rs. 300/- per day and monthly income of Rs. 9,000/- was not high. In the ruling reported in Managing Director, TNSTC vs Thahira & 3 others, 2016 (2) TNMAC 611 also it is held the notional income fixed by tribunal at Rs. 9,000/- was not excessive. Considering the above legal position , this Tribunal has fixed the monthly income of deceased person as Rs.9,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 13. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. Recently in a ruling reported in in Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (2) TNMAC 55(SC): 2013 (9) SCC 54 , it was decided future prospects applicable in a case of self-employed persons also. In the subsequent ruling reported in State Express Transport Crop Ltd vs D.Malliga, 2016 (1) TNMAC 309 (DB), it is decided the future prospects applicable to persons aged beyond 50 years and in case of self employed or on fixed wages, where there is no age of superannuation, 15% of income can be added towards future prospects for the persons in group of 50 – 60 years. The 6 annual income of the deceased was Rs. 9,000x12=1,08,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased was 40 years at the time of accident, 50% of income added towards future prospects and the annual income arrived to Rs. 108000+54000=162000/-. Deductions: 14. The deceased was married person at the time of accident. There are 5 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/4th of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/4th deduction the annual income of the deceased fixed as Rs.162000 – 40,500 = 121500/- per Annum. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 15. Considering the age of the deceased is 40 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 15 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore the compensation calculated to Rs.121500x15x=Rs18,22,500/- and therefore the petitioners are entitled Rs.18,22,500/- as compensation towards loss of income. COMPENSATION FOR CONSORTIUM AND LOVE AND AFFECTION CONSORTIUM 16. In Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2009 (2) TN MAC 36 (SC) and followed in Shashikala & another -Vs- Gangalakshmamana & another , 2015 (1) TN MAC 785 (SC) it has held that “Loss of consortium is usually for loss for spouse’s affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations for future years and in such circumstances, Courts to award at least Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation for Loss of Consortium” and this position followed in Reliance General Insurance Co Ltd -Vs-K.Meena & others, 2015 (2) TNMAC 449 . The 1st petitioner is wife and aged about 40 years at the time of the accident, which is the crucial period, at which time she very needed the companionship of her husband and for which Rs.1,00,000/- is awarded. Loss of Love & affection & Mental Agony and loss of Expectancy of life : 17. In Asha Verman -Vs- Maharaj Singh, 2015(1) TN MAC 465 (SC), it is held in para 18, that each children entitled at Rs. 1,00,000/- towards love and affection and each 7 parents are entitled at Rs. 50,000/-. The petitioners are the wife, sons and parents of the deceased and they have lost their love & affection of the deceased and it is not measurable by money. However, a small amount of Rs.1,00,000/- is considered in the lumpsum calculation towards love and affection. Funeral Expenses : 18. Decent burial is also one on the right under Art 21 of our constitution. The petitioners have failed to produce any expenditure statement relating to the funeral expenses, so the tribunal has awarded a minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- for the head, also relied the Judgment in Rajesh v. Rajbir singh [CDJ 2013 SC 485], the Hon’ble apex court has further held that “ Funeral expenses not only includes fee paid in crematorium or cementary but also includes religious practices and conventions performed on death in family. Hence in absence of any evidence to contrary, minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- to be awarded by Courts towards funeral expenses ”. Hence, a sum of Rs,25,000/- alone was considered and fixed the award in lumpsum manner. Loss of Estate, Transport Expenses and damages for articles:- 19. This Tribunal considered future prospects and 50% of income added towards future prospects. Hence, this Tribunal not awarded any under the head of Loss of Estate. The petitioners have not produced any documentary evidence showing the actual expenses for transport expenses. However, this Tribunal awarded Rs. 5000/- towards transport expenses. The petitioners have not accounted for the actual damages caused in accident. Hence, this Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs. 2000/- towards damage to clothes and articles. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 18,22,500/- 2.Loss of consortium ...Rs. 1,00,000/- 3.Loss of Love & Affection …Rs. 1,00,000/- 4.Loss of estate ...Rs NIL 5.Funeral expenses ...Rs. 25,000/- 6.Transport expenses ...Rs. 5,000/- 7.Damages to cloths and articles ...Rs. 2,000/- ------------------------ Total ...

Ltd., Vellore. .. Respondents. This petition, coming up for final hearing before me, on 1.3.2017, in the presence of Thiru. S. Kumar, Advocate for the Petitioners and Thiru. M.V. Jagadeesan, counsel for the 2nd respondent and the 1st Respondent remained absent and set exparte and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court doth delivereth the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 3. Name of deceased Person : Rajendiran 4. Age of the person dead : 46 years 5. Occupation : Guard in Canara Bank, Chennai, Agriculturist and Ex-serviceman. 6. Income pleaded : Rs.40,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 02.08.2015 8. Compensation claimed : Rs. 35,00,000/- 2 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the wife, sons, daughter and mother of the deceased Rajendiran who died in road accident. That on 2.8.2015 at about 7.45 P.M, while the deceased was riding two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-25-AF-0420 from Kalambur to Vellore in NH from North to South direction near K.V.M. Petrol Bunk at Kaniyambadi, on extreme left western side of the road with following the traffic rules and regulations, the bus bearing Regn.No. TN-23-BC-4699, owned by the 1st respondent was driven by its driver Mr. Anandan in a rash and negligent manner from opposite direction and dashed against the deceased and as a result of the accident the deceased sustained fatal injury on his head and died on the spot. The accident was reported to Vellore Taluk Police and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 383/2015, u/s. 279 & 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and working as a Guard in Canara Bank, Chennai and earned Rs.17,366/- per month. He was Ex-Serviceman and received pension of Rs.11,346/- per month. He is cultivating land and earned Rs. 12,000/- per month and totally earned Rs 40,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs.35,00,000/- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 2nd RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. The relationship of the claimants with the deceased and right to claim compensation was denied. The allegation that the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in rash and negligence manner and caused the accident was denied. But the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent act of the deceased, who ride the two wheeler in rash and negligen t manner without having any valid license. The owner and Insurance company of the two wheeler not impleaded and hence this claim petition not maintainable and hence this Respondent is not liable to pay the compensation amount. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner examined as PW1 and Mr. Vignesh examined as PW2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P10 marked on the side of the Petitioners. No oral and documentary evidence for the 2nd Respondent. 3 POINT NO.1: 6. It is admitted fact the 1st Respondent is the owner of the bus bearing Reg.No. TN- 23-BC-4699 which involved in the accident and Mr. Anandan was driving the offending vehicle at the time of accident. It is the case of petitioners that the 1st Respondent's driver drove the offending vehicle in rash and negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler ride by the deceased. But, the 2nd Respondent contended the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in a slow and careful manner and the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler by the deceased. The offending vehicle was inspected by the MVI, and issued the Ex.P.2, M.V.I. report stating the tyre condition was satisfactory and the Breaking system was in order and the accident was not happened due to any mechanical defect in the offending vehicle. The Ex.P.3 is the MVI report for the two wheeler ride by the deceased. The damages noted in both the M.V.I. reports proved the involvement of 1st Respondent's vehicle in accident. In this case the accident was admitted and the manner of accident alone disputed. Since, there was no mechanical defect in the vehicle and the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident, irrespective of whether criminal prosecution launched or not and irrespective of its result, the claimants has to prove the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver independently before this Tribunal. So, we have to decide whether the claimants have proved the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver. 7. It is also settled law that the term rashness and negligence has to be construed lightly while making a decision on a petition for claim for the same as compared to the word rashness and negligence as mention in the Indian Penal Code . This is because the chapter in the Motor Vehicle Act dealing with compensation is a benevolent legislation and not a penal one. Minding this legal principle we have to consider whether the claimants have proved the negligence of the 1st Respondent's driver. The P.W.1 deposed that on 2.8.2015 at about 7.45 P.M, while the deceased was riding two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-25-AF-0420 from Kalambur to Vellore, in NH road, in North to South direction near K.V.M.

The annual pension income of the deceased was Rs.11,346x12 = Rs. 1,36,152/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased was 48 years at the time of accident, 30% of income added towards future prospects and the monthly income arrived to Rs. 11,346x30% = 3,404/- and total income arrived to Rs. 11,346 + 3,404 = 14,750/-.

Occupation : Guard in Canara Bank, Chennai, Agriculturist and Ex-serviceman. 6. Income pleaded : Rs.40,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 02.08.2015 8. Compensation claimed : Rs. 35,00,000/- 2 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the wife, sons, daughter and mother of the deceased Rajendiran who died in road accident. That on 2.8.2015 at about 7.45 P.M, while the deceased was riding two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-25-AF-0420 from Kalambur to Vellore in NH from North to South direction near K.V.M. Petrol Bunk at Kaniyambadi, on extreme left western side of the road with following the traffic rules and regulations, the bus bearing Regn.No. TN-23-BC-4699, owned by the 1st respondent was driven by its driver Mr. Anandan in a rash and negligent manner from opposite direction and dashed against the deceased and as a result of the accident the deceased sustained fatal injury on his head and died on the spot. The accident was reported to Vellore Taluk Police and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 383/2015, u/s. 279 & 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and working as a Guard in Canara Bank, Chennai and earned Rs.17,366/- per month. He was Ex-Serviceman and received pension of Rs.11,346/- per month. He is cultivating land and earned Rs. 12,000/- per month and totally earned Rs 40,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs.35,00,000/- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 2nd RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. The relationship of the claimants with the deceased and right to claim compensation was denied. The allegation that the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in rash and negligence manner and caused the accident was denied. But the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent act of the deceased, who ride the two wheeler in rash and negligen t manner without having any valid license. The owner and Insurance company of the two wheeler not impleaded and hence this claim petition not maintainable and hence this Respondent is not liable to pay the compensation amount. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner examined as PW1 and Mr. Vignesh examined as PW2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P10 marked on the side of the Petitioners. No oral and documentary evidence for the 2nd Respondent. 3 POINT NO.1: 6. It is admitted fact the 1st Respondent is the owner of the bus bearing Reg.No. TN- 23-BC-4699 which involved in the accident and Mr. Anandan was driving the offending vehicle at the time of accident. It is the case of petitioners that the 1st Respondent's driver drove the offending vehicle in rash and negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler ride by the deceased. But, the 2nd Respondent contended the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in a slow and careful manner and the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler by the deceased. The offending vehicle was inspected by the MVI, and issued the Ex.P.2, M.V.I. report stating the tyre condition was satisfactory and the Breaking system was in order and the accident was not happened due to any mechanical defect in the offending vehicle. The Ex.P.3 is the MVI report for the two wheeler ride by the deceased. The damages noted in both the M.V.I. reports proved the involvement of 1st Respondent's vehicle in accident. In this case the accident was admitted and the manner of accident alone disputed. Since, there was no mechanical defect in the vehicle and the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident, irrespective of whether criminal prosecution launched or not and irrespective of its result, the claimants has to prove the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver independently before this Tribunal. So, we have to decide whether the claimants have proved the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver. 7. It is also settled law that the term rashness and negligence has to be construed lightly while making a decision on a petition for claim for the same as compared to the word rashness and negligence as mention in the Indian Penal Code . This is because the chapter in the Motor Vehicle Act dealing with compensation is a benevolent legislation and not a penal one. Minding this legal principle we have to consider whether the claimants have proved the negligence of the 1st Respondent's driver. The P.W.1 deposed that on 2.8.2015 at about 7.45 P.M, while the deceased was riding two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-25-AF-0420 from Kalambur to Vellore, in NH road, in North to South direction near K.V.M.

The P.W.1 not seen the accident directly and hence the P.W.1 evidence is not sufficient to prove the manner of accident. 4 8. The P.W. 2 is a teacher, working at Seventh Day convent. The P.W. 2 examined as occurrence witness and he deposed th at on 2.8.2015 at about 7.45 P.M, while he and his friend Ezhilan were returned from Virubatheeswarar Temple at Veppankuppam, through two wheeler on Kaniyambadi to Vellore road, the deceased was riding two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-25-AF-0420 in front of them and at that time the bus bearing Regn.No. TN-23-BC-4699 was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner from opposite direction and while over taking the car, dashed against the deceased and as a result of the accident the deceased sustained fatal injury on head and died on the spot and then only came to know the deceased was the father of his student Vinoth Kumar and informed to their family about the accident.

The 2nd Respondent contended the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler by the deceased. The 2nd Respondent has not put the 1st Respondent's driver into the witness box to state as to how the accident occurred and to depose that he was not at fault and was not driving the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. On the other hand the P.W.2 deposed in cross examination that he saw the accident in 100 ft distance and his evidence proved the accident was occurred only due to rash and negligence of 1st Respondent's driver .

Occupation : Guard in Canara Bank, Chennai, Agriculturist and Ex-serviceman. 6. Income pleaded : Rs.40,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 02.08.2015 8. Compensation claimed : Rs. 35,00,000/- 2 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the wife, sons, daughter and mother of the deceased Rajendiran who died in road accident. That on 2.8.2015 at about 7.45 P.M, while the deceased was riding two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-25-AF-0420 from Kalambur to Vellore in NH from North to South direction near K.V.M. Petrol Bunk at Kaniyambadi, on extreme left western side of the road with following the traffic rules and regulations, the bus bearing Regn.No. TN-23-BC-4699, owned by the 1st respondent was driven by its driver Mr. Anandan in a rash and negligent manner from opposite direction and dashed against the deceased and as a result of the accident the deceased sustained fatal injury on his head and died on the spot. The accident was reported to Vellore Taluk Police and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 383/2015, u/s. 279 & 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and working as a Guard in Canara Bank, Chennai and earned Rs.17,366/- per month. He was Ex-Serviceman and received pension of Rs.11,346/- per month. He is cultivating land and earned Rs. 12,000/- per month and totally earned Rs 40,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs.35,00,000/- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 2nd RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. The relationship of the claimants with the deceased and right to claim compensation was denied. The allegation that the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in rash and negligence manner and caused the accident was denied. But the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent act of the deceased, who ride the two wheeler in rash and negligen t manner without having any valid license. The owner and Insurance company of the two wheeler not impleaded and hence this claim petition not maintainable and hence this Respondent is not liable to pay the compensation amount. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner examined as PW1 and Mr. Vignesh examined as PW2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P10 marked on the side of the Petitioners. No oral and documentary evidence for the 2nd Respondent. 3 POINT NO.1: 6. It is admitted fact the 1st Respondent is the owner of the bus bearing Reg.No. TN- 23-BC-4699 which involved in the accident and Mr. Anandan was driving the offending vehicle at the time of accident. It is the case of petitioners that the 1st Respondent's driver drove the offending vehicle in rash and negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler ride by the deceased. But, the 2nd Respondent contended the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in a slow and careful manner and the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler by the deceased. The offending vehicle was inspected by the MVI, and issued the Ex.P.2, M.V.I. report stating the tyre condition was satisfactory and the Breaking system was in order and the accident was not happened due to any mechanical defect in the offending vehicle. The Ex.P.3 is the MVI report for the two wheeler ride by the deceased. The damages noted in both the M.V.I. reports proved the involvement of 1st Respondent's vehicle in accident. In this case the accident was admitted and the manner of accident alone disputed. Since, there was no mechanical defect in the vehicle and the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident, irrespective of whether criminal prosecution launched or not and irrespective of its result, the claimants has to prove the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver independently before this Tribunal. So, we have to decide whether the claimants have proved the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver. 7. It is also settled law that the term rashness and negligence has to be construed lightly while making a decision on a petition for claim for the same as compared to the word rashness and negligence as mention in the Indian Penal Code . This is because the chapter in the Motor Vehicle Act dealing with compensation is a benevolent legislation and not a penal one. Minding this legal principle we have to consider whether the claimants have proved the negligence of the 1st Respondent's driver. The P.W.1 deposed that on 2.8.2015 at about 7.45 P.M, while the deceased was riding two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-25-AF-0420 from Kalambur to Vellore, in NH road, in North to South direction near K.V.M. Petrol Bunk at Kaniyambadi, on extreme left western side of the road with following the traffic rules and regulations, the bus bearing Regn.No. TN-23-BC-4699, owned by the 1st respondent was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner from opposite direction and dashed against the deceased and as a result of the accident the deceased sustained fatal injury on head and died on the spot. The P.W.1 not seen the accident directly and hence the P.W.1 evidence is not sufficient to prove the manner of accident. 4 8. The P.W. 2 is a teacher, working at Seventh Day convent. The P.W. 2 examined as occurrence witness and he deposed th at on 2.8.2015 at about 7.45 P.M, while he and his friend Ezhilan were returned from Virubatheeswarar Temple at Veppankuppam, through two wheeler on Kaniyambadi to Vellore road, the deceased was riding two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-25-AF-0420 in front of them and at that time the bus bearing Regn.No. TN-23-BC-4699 was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner from opposite direction and while over taking the car, dashed against the deceased and as a result of the accident the deceased sustained fatal injury on head and died on the spot and then only came to know the deceased was the father of his student Vinoth Kumar and informed to their family about the accident. The 1st petitioner lodged complaint before Vellore Taluk police and they have registered case in Cr.No.383/2015 u/s 279 & 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and wherein also it was stated the 1st Respondent's driver drove the bus in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against two wheeler ride by the deceased. 9. The 2nd Respondent contended the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler by the deceased. The 2nd Respondent has not put the 1st Respondent's driver into the witness box to state as to how the accident occurred and to depose that he was not at fault and was not driving the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. On the other hand the P.W.2 deposed in cross examination that he saw the accident in 100 ft distance and his evidence proved the accident was occurred only due to rash and negligence of 1st Respondent's driver . Hence, it is decided the accident was occurred only due to rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver. Point No.2: 10. The 1st petitioner is the wife, 2nd and 3rd petitioners are sons and 4th petitioner is daughter and 5th petitioner is mother of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.8 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.4 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein the Doctor noted the following External Injuries:- 1.

The Doctor also noted the following Internal Injuries:- 1.

It is already decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver. The Ex.P.4 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in accident. The first Respondent insured the vehicle with the 2nd Respondent and the insurance was in force on the date of accident and this fact was proved through Ex.P.9 copy of Insurance Policy certificate. The 1st Respondent's driver also has valid driving license to drive the offending vehicle at the time of accident and this fact was proved from entries in Ex.P.2 MVI report. The deceased also has valid driving license to ride two wheeler at the time of accident and this fact was proved from Ex.P.10 Xerox copy driving license of the deceased. Hence, the Respondents are liable to pay compensation to the claimants. HELMET 12. The 2nd Respondent counsel argued the deceased not wear the helmet at the time of accident and hence there was violation of MV. Rules by the deceased and hence the claimants not entitled for compensation. The Doctor opined in Ex.P.2 postmortem certificate that the death was due to effect of head injuries. The P.W. 1 & 2 also admitted the deceased was died due to head injury. If the deceased wear helmet, the death could have been avoided and there is every chance to save the life of the deceased. The 2nd Respondent not pleaded in counter about the non wearing of helmet by the deceased. There was cross examination before the P.W.1 & 2 in this regard. Hence, it is decided without raising the issue of non wearing helmet in counter, the 2nd Respondent not entitled to address in argument. Therefore, it is decided there was no negligence on the part of deceased. 6 AGE 13. The deceased was Ex-Serviceman. The Ex.P.7 is the discharge book with pension details of the deceased. In Ex.P.7 the date of birth of deceased was mentioned as 10.5.1968 and it is proved the age of deceased was 47 years, 2 months, 22 days and he crossed the age of 47 and hence the age of deceased was fixed to 48 years at the time of accident.

Natarajan, B.Sc., B.L., I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Vellore. Monday, the 3rd day of April, 2017. M.C.O.P.No. 604/2015 1. Rahana Begam @ Reyana Begam 2. Anwar Basha .. Petitioners. /Vs/ 1. Murugan 2. The Divisional Manager, The New India Insurance Co. Ltd., .. Respondents. This petition, coming up for final hearing before me, on 22.02.2017, in the presence of Thiru.S.Dakshinamoorthy, Advocate for the Petitioners and Thiru. J. Kathiravan, counsel for the 1st respondent and Thiru D.P. Paul Sudesh, Advocate for the 2nd Respondent and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court doth delivereth the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 3. Name of deceased Person : Usman Basha 4. Age of the person dead : 19 years 5. Occupation : +2 student 6. Income pleaded : Rs. NIL 7. Date of Accident : 28.05.2015 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.25,00,000/- 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the parents of the deceased Usman Basha who died in a road accident. That on 28.05.2015, at about 1.00 P.M, while the deceased was riding motor cycle bearing Reg.No. TN-23-BB- 1222 on the left side of the road at Thorapadi to Vellore main road, near Don Basco School ground, opposite to Nirmala Sisubhavan, the Lorry bearing Reg.No. TN-01-V-8541, owned by the 1st respondent, driven by its driver in the same direction, in a rash and 2 negligent manner without following the traffic rules, and dashed the deceased riding motor cycle and ran over the deceased body and he died on the spot. The accident was reported to Vellore South Police and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 338/2015, u/s. 279 & 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and was studying +2 and he was very brilliant student and due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs.25,00,000/- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 1st RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in slow and careful manner following all traffic rules. But the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler by the deceased. The accident vehicle is insured with the 2nd respondent and the policy was alive, and the driver had valid license at the time of accident and hence the 2nd respondent is liable to pay the claim amount. The petitioners are not entitled to get any compensation for the deceased for his own fault. The amount claimed is too excessive. 4. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 2nd RESPONDENT:- The age of the deceased is denied. The place, date and time of the accident are not admitted. The accident was solely due to the fault of the deceased who had ridden the two wheeler and suddenly turned without noticing the traffic rules and on coming lorry. There was contributory negligence at a major extent on the part of the deceased. The deceased had no driving license to drive the two wheeler at the time of accident. The amount claimed is excessive. 5. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 6. The 2nd petitioner examined as PW1 and Mr. Syed Khaleel examined as PW2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P.6 marked on the side of the Petitioners. Mr. Prabhu, the driver of the 1st respondent examined as RW1 and Ex.R1 to Ex.R3 marked on his side. 3 POINT NO.1:- 7. It is admitted fact that the 1st Respondent is the owner of the Lorry bearing Reg.No. TN-01-V-8541 which involved in the accident and the RW1 was the driver of the offending vehicle at the time of accident. The petitioners contended the R.W.1 drove the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler ridden by the deceased. But, the 2nd Respondent contended that the R.W.1 drove the lorry in a slow and careful manner and the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler by the deceased. Since, the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident as pleaded by the claimants and there was no mechanical defects in the offending vehicle, we have to decide whether the 1st Respondent's driver is responsible for the accident and there was any contributory negligence on the part of deceased. 8. The P.W.1 deposed that on 28.05.2015, at about 1.00 P.M, while the deceased was riding motor cycle bearing Reg.No. TN-23-BB-1222 on the left side of the road at Thorapadi to Vellore main road, near Don Basco School ground, opposite to Nirmala Sisubhavan, the Lorry bearing Reg.No. TN-01-V-8541, driven by its driver in the same direction, in a rash and negligent manner and dashed the deceased riding motor cycle and ran over the deceased body and caused the accident. The P.W.1 not seen the accident directly and hence the P.W.1 evidence is not sufficient to prove the manner of accident. 9. The P.W.2 examined as occurrence witness and he deposed that on 28.05.2015, at about 1.00 P.M, while the deceased was riding motor cycle bearing Reg.No. TN-23-BB- 1222 on the left side of the road at Thorapadi to Vellore main road, near Don Basco School ground, opposite to Nirmala Sisubhavan, the Lorry bearing Reg.No. TN-01-V-8541, came on the back side of the deceased two wheeler, driven by its driver, in a rash and negligent manner and dashed the deceased two wheeler and ran over the deceased body and he died on the spot. The P.W.2 denied the suggestion that the accident was happened due to the negligent riding of the two wheeler by the deceased. 10. The 1st Respondent's driver examined as R.W.1 and deposed that he has driving the lorry following the traffic rules and the deceased was riding the two wheeler in the opposite direction in a rash and negligent manner and suddenly turned on the right side and again turned on the leftern side and dashed against the another two wheeler and fell down near the back side left wheel of the lorry. The offending vehicles were inspected 4 by the MVI and issued the Ex.R2 and R3 M.V.I. reports. The Ex.R3 is the MVI report of the 1st respondent lorry wherein it is mentioned the damages of front and both wind screen glass are broken. The Ex.P.3 MVI report proved the involvement of 1st Respondent's lorry with the accident. The P.W. 2 clearly deposed the 1st Respondent's lorry dashed behind the two wheeler and hence the two wheeler fell down on the side of the road and the deceased fell down on the road itself and hence the left back side wheel run over the deceased. The P.W. 2 evidence clearly proved the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligence driving of R.W.1. Hence, it is decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligen t driving of R.W. 1. Point No.2: 11. The petitioners are the parents of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.3 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein the Doctor noted the following External Injuries:- 1. Reddish brown abrasions: a) 2.5 x 1.8 cm on front of the right forehead. b) 4.3 x 2.5 cm on the left cheek. c) 5.2 x 3.5 cm on the left side of the head. d) 5.8 x 3.5 cm on the right knee; e) multiple small abrasions over an area of 14.5 x 12.5 cm on the front and outer aspect of right foot. 2. Large reddish grazed abrasions a) 52.5 x 34.5 cm on the front of entire chest and abdomen; b) 18.2 x 11.5 cm on the back of the neck; c) 16.5 x 8.2 cm on the back of the left shoulder; d) 19.5 x 8.3 cm on the front and outer aspect of right thigh; 3) 21.5 x 9.5 cm on the outer aspect of left thigh. 3. Large reddish brown tyre mark on the entire back. 4) Vertically oblique large irregular laceration 24.5x 11.5 cm x bone deep on the left shoulder exposing the head of the right humerus; margins were irregular, crushed and contused; irregular comminuted fracture of left collar bone with surrounding soft tissue contusion and extravasation of blood were present. 5. Horizontally oblique large irregular laceration 48.5 x 22.5xm x pelvic cavity deep extending from the left iliac fossa to the inner aspect of the middle third of the right thigh across the perineum; margins were ragged and contused; Entire viscera of the chest and abdomen were found contused and exteriorized through the wound; upper halves of both thigh bones, genital organs, entire pelvic bone, entire spine below C6 vertebrae and their surrounding soft tissues were crushed and contused. 6. Swelling and deformity of the middle third of the right thigh was present; on further dissection: irregular complete fracture of middle third of right femur with surrounding soft tissues contusion and extravasation of blood were present. The Doctor also noted the following Internal Injuries:- 1. Thorax: irregular comminuted fracture of left collar bone, all the 24 ribs and sternum was present with surrounding soft tissues contusion and extravasation of blood; 2.Heart : contused and exteriorized 3.Lungs contused and exteriorized 4. Abdominal cavity: Empty except for few crushed parts of intestines; 5. Liver,Spleen and both the Kidneys: contused and exteriorized. 6. Intestines: contused and exteriorized. 5 The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died of crush injury to the chest and abdomen. 12. It is already decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in the accident. The 1st Respondent insured the vehicle with the 2nd Respondent and the insurance was in force on the date of accident and this fact was proved through Ex.P.6 copy of Insurance Policy certificate. AGE 13. The deceased was studying + 2 standard at the time of accident. The Ex.P. 4 is the xerox copy of the school transfer certificate and wherein the date of birth of the deceased was mentioned as 5.8.1998 and it proved the correct age of deceased was 16 years, 9 months and 23 days and hence the age deceased was fixed at 17 years at the time of accident. INCOME 14. The petitioners claimed Rs.25,00,000/- as compensation. The deceased was +2 student and he was non earing member at the time of accident. The deceased was studying XI th standard at the time of accident. In the ruling reported in The New India Assurance Co. Ltd. vs Bal Kishan Pawar & Ors. on 31 May, 2012, https://indiankanoon.org/doc/193748239/ , the notional income of XII standard student was fixed to Rs. 15,000/- and at para 13 of judgment the Hon'ble Delhi High Court decided as follows:- 13. In the present case, the deceased was a very bright student of 12th standard and had submitted an application for National Defence Academy (NDA) Examination on 24th June, 1992. The acknowledgment card of the said application has been proved as Ex.PW1/7. Upon successful passing of the said examination, the deceased would have joined the defence services as Second Lieutenant with a salary of `15,000/- per month and would have retired with a minimum salary of `35,000/- per month. In United India Insurance Co. v. Kanwar Lal (supra), the deceased aged 18 years, was a student of XIIth standard and was ambitious to become MBA/C.A. whereas in National Insurance Company Limited v. Gaje Singh (supra), the deceased aged 11 years, was a student of Vth standard and was ambitious to become an engineer. In both the aforesaid cases, the ambition of the deceased had not taken shape and this Court assumed the income of `10,800/- following the judgment of the Supreme Court in Municipal Corporation of 6 Delhi v. Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy (supra). However, in the present case, the deceased aged 17 years, was a brilliant student of XIIth standard and his ambition to join the defense services was taking shape as the deceased had applied for the NDA examination on 24th June, 1992 but his unfortunate accident snatched away his life before he could appear in the examination. The parents of the deceased successfully proved that upon selection in NDA examination, the deceased would have joined the defense services as Second Lieutenant at a salary of `15,000/- per month and would have retired as Lieutenant Colonel at a minimum salary of `35,000/- per month. In view of the clear evidence on record, it is safe to draw a presumption that the deceased would have earned atleast `15,000/- per month. Following the judgment of the Supreme Court in Municipal Corporation of Delhi v. Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy(supra) and of this Court in United India Insurance Company Limited v. Kanwar Lal (supra) and National Insurance Company Limited v. Gaje Singh (supra), the income of the deceased is taken to be `15,000/- per month. In the above referred case it was evidenced that the deceased was a student of 12th standard in a reputed school of Delhi with ambition to become MBA decree holder. Even though it was pleaded the deceased was brilliant student, there was no evidence for the ambition of the deceased and more over regarding the academy status of school wherein the deceased was studying XII Standard. Considering these aspects, this tribunal fixed the notional income of deceased at Rs.10,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 15. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. Recently in a ruling reported in In Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (2) TNMAC 55(SC): 2013 (9) SCC 54 , it was decided future prospects applicable in a case of self-employed persons also. The petitioner counsel argued that as per the above ruling the claimants are entitled for future prospects. The deceased not getting standard income. In the recent ruling reported in Chikkamma & another -Vs- Paravathamma & another, in C.A.No. 3409/2017, dated 28.2.2017, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided the issue of future prospects for unorganised sectors pending before the larger Bench and hence the concept of future prospects not applicable for 7 unorganised sectors. The deceased in this case also not getting standard income and an unorganised sector and hence it is decided the future prospects not applicable to this case. The same legal position was reiterated in the ruling of our High Court, Madras , reported in United India Insurance Co. vs Yasoda; 2016 TN MAC 784, has decided regarding the future prospects for self-employer or fixed wages as follows:- “ the future prospects in case of self-employer or fixed wages, to be added to the compensation towards the dependency, there is difference of opinion among the cases in Sarla Verma v. DTC (2009) 6 SCC 121, Reshma Kumari v. Madan Mohan (2013) 9 SCC 65 and Rajesh and Ors. v. Rajbir Singh & Ors ., (2013) 2 TN MAC 55 (SC). One view is that there can't be any addition towards future prospects for the deceased working in a non-organised sector. Another view is that 50% is to be added as future prospects in those cases. The matter is before the Larger Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Therefore, let us not advert to the future prospects in this case and take the monthly income as his earnings without adding future prospects”. The deceased in this case also belonged to non-organised sector. Hence, considering the above legal position, it is decided the future prospects not applicable for this case. Deductions: 16. The deceased was bachelor at the time of accident. There are 2 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted ½ of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After ½ deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs. 5000/- per month. MULTIPLIER FOR BACHELOR 17. The Honourable Supreme Court in the decision in Amirt Bhanu Shali vs. National Insurance Co. Ltd . (2012 (2) TN MAC 321 (SC)) has held as follows: The selection of Multiplier is based on the age of the deceased and not on the basis of the age of dependent. There may be a number of dependents of the deceased whose age may be different and, therefore, the age of dependents has no nexus with the computation of compensation As per the above dictum laid down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court , the age of the deceased considered for fixing the multiplier. Since the deceased 17 years of age at the time of accident as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 18 is adopted for calculation of “loss of dependency” to the family and arrived to Rs. 5000X12x18 =Rs.10,80,000/-. 8 COMPENSATION FOR LOVE AND AFFECTION 18. In Asha Verman -Vs- Maharaj Singh, 2015(1) TN MAC 465 (SC), it is held in para 18, that each children entitled at Rs. 1,00,000/- towards love and affection and each parents are entitled at Rs. 50,000/-. The petitioners are the parents of the deceased and they have lost their love & affection of the deceased and it is not measurable by money. However, a small amount of Rs.1,00,000/- is considered in the lumpsum calculation towards love and affection. Funeral Expenses : 19. Decent burial is also one on the right under Art 21 of our constitution, The petitioner has failed to produced any expenditure statement relating to the funeral expenses, so the tribunal has awarded a minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- for the head, also relied the Judgment in Rajesh v. Rajbir singh [CDJ 2013 SC 485], the Hon’ble apex court has further held that “ Funeral expenses not only includes fee paid in crematorium or cementary but also includes religious practices and conventions performed on death in family. Hence in absence of any evidence to contrary, minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- to be awarded by Courts towards funeral expenses ”. Hence, a sum of Rs,25,000/- alone was considered and fixed the award in lumpsum manner. Loss of Estate, Transport Expenses and damages for articles:- 20. This Tribunal considered not future prospects and hence this Tribunal awarded Rs.50,000/- under the head of Loss of Estate. The petitioner not produced any documentary evidence showing the actual expenses for transport expenses. However, this Tribunal awarded Rs. 5000/- towards transport expenses. The petitioners not accounted for the actual damages caused in accident. Hence, this Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs. 2000/- towards damage to clothes and articles. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 10,80,000/- 2.Loss of consortium ...Rs. NIL 3.Loss of Love & Affection …Rs. 1,00,000/- 4.Loss of estate ...Rs 50,000/- 5.Medical Expenses …Rs. NIL 6.Funeral expenses ...Rs. 25,000/- 7.Transport expenses ...Rs. 5,000/- 8.Damages to cloths and articles ...Rs. 2,000/- ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 12,62,000/- ------------------------ 9 21. In the result, this petition is partly allowed with costs and the petitioners are entitled for Rs. 12,62,000/- (Rupees Twelve Lakhs Sixty two Thousand only) as compensation. The 2nd respondents is directed to pay and deposit the award amount into this court within 4 weeks from this day with interest at 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this petition (28.7.2015) till the date of deposit.

The rider of the motorcycle was not holding valid driving licence and the said vehicle was also not insured with any insurance company at the time of accident. Totally 4 persons were travelled in the motorcycle at the time of accident which is against the provisions of Motor Vehicle Act. Therefore, the petitioners are not entitled to get compensation from the 2nd respondent. The rider/deceased was atleast guilty of contributory negligence to a major extent for which the award if any ought to be reduced. The compensation amount and interest claimed by the petitioners are so high. The 2nd respondent is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. Hence, the petitions are liable to be dismissed. 4. The Points to be considered are:- 1. Who is responsible for the accident? 2.

The petitioners have stated that on 26.02.2012 at about 08:30 P.M., while the rider of two wheeler, namely, Stalin has driven the two wheeler bearing registration No.TN 23 AF 6370, carrying his wife Nirmala and daughter Anjelin Celestina and proceeded from Chittoor towards Vellore at Panotoor Village, Chittoor to Vellore Road, Gudipala Mandal, met with an accident due to hitting of Mahindra Mini Bus bearing registration No.AP 03 U 9319 owned by the 1st respondent. To prove the claim of compensation in MCOP No.913/2014 and MCOP No.131/2015, the petitioner Nithyanandam has examined himself as P.W.1 and P.W.2 respectively. The 1st petitioner Premakumari in MCOP No.917/2014 has examined herself as P.W.3. The claimants/petitioners have examined one Nirmal Sekar as P.W.4/eye witness to the accident. All the above said witnesses have stated cogently in their evidence that the accident took place only due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the Mahindra Mini Bus 8 bearing registration No. AP 03 U 9319. Ex.P1 is the attested xerox copy of F.I.R., in which it is seen that Gudipala Police have registered the criminal case as against the driver of Mahindra Mini Bus bearing registration No. AP 03 U 9319 u/s 304(A) of IPC., Ex.P4 is the attested xerox copy of M.V.I. report in which it is mentioned that the accident was not due to any mechanical defect of the vehicle. 7. The accident was not denied by the respondents. The 1st respondent remained absent, set exparte. The 2nd respondent's contention is that the accident was occurred solely due to the rash and negligent driving of the rider of the motorcycle, namely, Stalin who had suddenly overtook the Mini Bus without observing the traffic rules and that there was no rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent's mini bus. It is further stated by the 2nd respondent in the counter that the rider of the motorcycle was not holding valid driving licence and the said vehicle was also not insured with any insurance company at the time of accident and that totally 4 persons were travelled in the motorcycle at the time of accident which is against the provisions of Motor Vehicle Act and that the police complaint was falsely given against the driver of the mini bus and hence, the petitioners are not entitled to get compensation from the 2nd respondent. Admittedly, no oral or documentary evidence was let in on the side of the 2nd respondent to prove that the accident occurred due to the rash driving and sudden overtake done by the deceased Stalin in a negligent manner. But, from the contents of F.I.R., Ex.P1, it is noticed that at the time of accident, the 9 deceased Stalin, his wife Nirmala and two female children, namely, Linni Cristina, aged 10 years and Angelin Celestina, aged 4 years travelled in the two wheeler, sustained multiple injuries and died at the spot. The complaint was given by one James Prakasam, S/o Yesudian. 8. The eye witness/P.W.2 has stated in his evidence that on 26.02.2012 at 08:30 P.M., he was standing on the left side edge of the Chittoor to Vellore road at Panatoor Village, Gudipala Mandal and at that time, the motorcycle driven by Stalin came there and that his wife Nirmala and his two daughters, namely, Anjelin Celestina and Linni Cristina travelled in the motorcycle as pillion riders and that the motorcyclist has driven the vehicle on the extreme left side of the road and at the same time, the Mini Bus bearing registration No. AP 03 U 9319 came in the opposite direction in the wrong route, in the extreme right side in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the motorcycle vehemently and all of them sustained severe, multiple injuries in their heads and all over the body and died on the spot itself. According to the eye witness/P.W.4, the driver of the Mini Bus was solely responsible for the accident. From the oral evidence of P.W.1 to 4 and from Ex.P1, the petitioners have proved that the Mini Bus driver has caused the accident by his rash and negligent driving. But, at the same time, the deceased has driven the motorcycle carrying two children and his wife as pillion riders as against the provisions of Motor Vehicle Act. There is every possibility for the deceased lost his balance. Further, all the four persons died due to head injury. It is not established by the petitioners that the riders worn 10 helmet at the time of accident. The 2nd respondent also contended that the deceased Stalin has not possessed valid driving licence and his vehicle has no policy coverage at the time of accident. No document is filed by the petitioners to prove that the deceased was holding valid driving licence at the time of accident. Ex.P4 M.V.I. Report disclosed the fact that Insurance Certificate was not produced at the time of accident. Therefore, taking into account of all these facts, it is held that the accident took place mainly due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the Mahindra Mini Bus bearing registration No. AP 03 U 9319 and also due to the contributory negligence of the rider of the motorcyclist and the responsibility is fixed at the ratio of 80% on the part of the Mini Bus Driver and 20% on the part of the motorcyclist and the Point No.1 is answered accordingly.

As per Ex.P6 Insurance Policy, the mini bus was duly insured with the 2nd respondent Insurance Company and the vehicle has valid policy coverage at the time of accident. The 1st responent who is the owner of 11 the Mahindra Mini Bus is vicariously liable for the negligent act of his driver. In Point No.1, contributory negligence was fixed on the part of the deceased at 20% and hence, the insurer of the 1st respondent's vehicle, i.e., the 2nd respondent is liable to pay 80% of compensation amount to the claimants in these cases and the Point No.2 is answered accordingly. POINT NO.3 :(MCOP.NO.913/2014):- 10. The petitioner Nithyanandam has claimed Rs.25,00,000/- in this application. The petitioner/P.W.1 has stated that he is the grandfather of the deceased Anjelin Celestina. He has stated in his evidence that the father and mother of the deceased Anjelin Celestina died in the same accident. Ex.P3 Relationship Certificate reveals the said fact. The petitioner has not filed sufficient proof for claiming Rs.25,00,000/- as compensation. Considering the available materials on hand, the compensation is computed as follows: AGE 11. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 4 years. In Ex.P2 Postmortem Report also the approximate age of deceased was recorded as 4 years. The petitioner has not filed any other authenticated proof to show the correct age of the deceased Anjelin Celestina.

Considering the oral evidence of P.W.1 and also considering the age and date of accident, this Tribunal has fixed the notional monthly income of deceased minor girl as Rs.5,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS: 17. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in its latest verdict in The National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and Others, Special Leave 13 petition (Civil) No. 25590 of 2014 order dated 31.10.2017 has held that even in case of person has self employed on a fixed salary, an additional of 40% of the established income should be the warrant where the deceased was below the age of 40 years. An addition of 25% where the deceased was between the age of 40 to 50 years and 10% where the deceased was between the age of 50 to 60 years should be regarded as the necessary method of computation. The deceased was a self employed. Considering the age and nature of work of the deceased, this tribunal deems that 40% of monthly income should be added towards future prospects and thus the income of the deceased is arrived at Rs.5,000/- + Rs.2,000/- = Rs. 7,000/-.

After such deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs.3,500/-. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME: 19. Considering the age of the deceased is 4 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 15 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, the compensation calculated to Rs.3,500/- x 12 x 15 = Rs.6,30,000/- and therefore the petitioner is entitled Rs. 6,30,000/- as compensation towards loss of income. 14 COMPENSATION UNDER OTHER HEADS: 20. The claimant is the grandfather of the deceased. He has lost the love and affection of the deceased and it is not measurable by money.

It is stated by the petitioners that at the time of accident, the deceased was aged about 37 years. In Ex.P9 Postmortem Certificate the age of the deceased was mentioned as 37 years. The petitioners have not filed any other authenticated proof of age. So, on the basis of Ex.P9, the age of the deceased is fixed as 37 years at the time of accident. INCOME 23.

Therefore, taking note of the facts and circumstances of the case, age of the deceased and date of accident, this Tribunal has fixed the notional monthly income of deceased person as Rs.9,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 24. The Counsel for the Petitioners has pointed out that the Hon'ble Supreme Court in its latest verdict in The National Insurance Company Limited Vs.

The 1st respondent/driver­cum­owner did not have licence to drive the two wheeler and without licence the 1st respondent drove the two wheeler and dashed the petitioner is against the conditions of Policy for which the 2nd respondent is not liable to pay any compensation to the petitioner for which the 1st respondent driver cum owner himself is liable to pay any compensation if arises.

The Court document, Disability Certificate issued by the Joint Director of Medical and Rural Health Services, Vellore, Vellore District is marked as Ex.C1. The learned counsel for the petitioner has filed the two citations reported in 2021(1) TNMAC 116 in the High Court of Madras CMA.No.651 of 2013 & M.P.No.1/2013, dated 06.11.2020 and reported in 2021(1) TNMAC 696 in the High Court of Madras CMA.No.739/2021 & CMP.No.4393/2021, dated 30.03.2021. /6/ 7. Point No.1: (i) It is the case of the Petitioner, that on 01.04.2013 at about 9.30 PM while the petitioner was walking on the left side of the road to go to his house at Kurumbalapalayam, proceeding from Kaniyambadi to Kaniyambadi Pudhur Road, Near Kuruvikara Colony in a very careful manner, at that time the 1st respondent driven his TVS XL Vehicle bearing Regn.No.TN.23.BB.7368 in a rash and negligent manner without following any traffic rules and regulations and he dashed on the petitioner, in which the petitioner sustained grievous injuries in his both legs and all over his body. (ii) To prove the case of the petitioner, the petitioner filed the copy of FIR, M.V.I. Report and Copy of the extract of Order passed in STC.No.309/2013 and the same are marked as Ex.P1, P.3 and P.4 . The rider of the Motorcycle bearing Regn.No.TN.23.BB.7368 was shown in the accused column. On the side of 2nd respondent, through RW1, Investigation Report has been marked as Ex.R.1 and on perusal of Ex.P.4, it is found that the rider of the Motorcycle bearing Regn.No. TN.23.BB.7368 was charged U/s.279, 338 IPC 3 r/w 181 MV Act and /7/ the accused admitted the offence and paid fine of Rs.2,500/­ for the said offences. The Second Respondent has not brought anything contra from the cross examination of PW1 as to the cause of the accident. (iii) Hence, from the oral evidence of P.W.1 & R.W.1, and the documentary evidence of Ex.P1, copy of FIR, Ex.P3,M.V.I. Report and Ex.P4 Copy of the extract of Order passed in STC.No.309/2013 and since there is no contra evidence available, this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the accident has occurred due to the rash and negligent riding of the rider of the Motorcycle bearing Regn.No.TN.23.BB.7368 . Thus the Point No.(1) is answered accordingly. 8. Point No.2 :­ In Point No.(1), it has been found that the accident has occurred due to the rash and negligent riding of the rider of the Motorcycle bearing Regn.No.TN.23.BB.7368 . The Second respondent has not denied about the insurance policy and marked copy of the Insurance policy as Ex.R.2, but stated in their counter that the drive cum owner did not have licence to drive the two wheeler and without licence the 1st respondent drove the two wheeler /8/ and dashed the petitioner. As per the copy of the extract of order passed in STC.No.309/2013 which is marked as Ex.P.4, he was charged U/s.279, 338 IPC 3 r/w 181 of MV Act. Hence it is proved that the rider of the 1st Respondent’s Motorcycle bearing Regn.No. TN.23.BB.7368 has driven the same without driving licence on the date of accident. Therefore, this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the said vehicle had a valid insurance issued by the Second respondent at the time of the accident and there is a violation of Insurance policy condition. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent at the time of arguments submitted that since there is a violation of policy condition the insurance company is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioner. But the learned counsel for the petitioner has filed the two citations reported in 2021(1) TNMAC 116 in the High Court of Madras CMA.No.651 of 2013 & M.P.No.1/2013, dated 06.11.2020 and reported in 2021(1) TNMAC 696 in the High Court of Madras CMA.No.739/2021 & CMP.No.4393/2021, dated 30.03.2021, wherein it is held that the insurance company has to pay the compensation and /9/ can recover the same from the owner of the vehicle. As per 2018(2) TNMAC Division Bench Judgement of Supreme Court by Justice Mr.Ranjan Gogai and MS R.Banumathy in C.A.No.8144/2018 (S.L.P(C) No.26955 of 2017) Dt.8.8.2018 in Shamanna and another Vs Oriental Insurance Co.Ltd and others. Held that "" Even where the Insurer is able to prove breach on the part of the insured concerning the policy condition regarding holding of a valid Licence by the driver or his qualification to drive during the relevant period, the insurer would not be allowed to avoid its liability towards the insured unless the said breach or breaches on the condition of driving licence is/are so fundamental as are found to have contributed to the cause of accident"" . If a vehicle at the time of accident was driven by a person having a learner's licence, the insurance companies would be liable to satisfy the decree. Hence, as per the above decision of Hon'ble Supreme court, the Second respondent being the insurer is liable to pay the compensation to the petitioner at first instance with a liberty to recover /10/ the same from the 1st Respondent without filing any petition. Accordingly the Point No.(2) is answered. 9. Point No.(3) (i) In this petition and as P.W.1 in his evidence, the petitioner has stated as to the injuries sustained by him in detail. The copy of Medical Officer's opinion given by Vellore Medical College Hospital, Adukkambarai and the same is marked as Ex.P.2. The Petitioner stated in his petition that he took inpatient treatment in the Vellore Medical College Hospital, Vellore from 01.04.2013 to 20.05.2013 and Plating was done for the fracture. On perusal of the medical records, it is seen that the petitioner has sustained Proximal humerous fracture on the left shoulder and fracture of tibia on the right leg and the injuries appears to be grievous in nature. The PW1 has not examined the Doctor who has given treatment to him. The Ex.C1 is the Disability Certificate issued by the Joint Director of Medical and Rural Health Services, Vellore and it shows the disability percentage as 30%. /11/ Hence this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the Petitioner has suffered Disability of 30% and the Petitioner is entitled for compensation for the injuries sustained by him, Rs.3,000/­ per percentage is allowed. Hence the Petitioner is entitled for Rs.90,000/­ only as just compensation for the injuries sustained by her. (ii) Income of the Petitioner: The Petitioner stated in his petition that he was an Agriculturist and Milk Vendor and was earning a sum of Rs.30,000/­ per month. But to prove his avocation and monthly income, he did not file any documentary evidence. Hence, in these circumstances, notional income has to be determined. Therefore, this Tribunal is inclined to fix Rs.7,000/­ as notional monthly income of the petitioner. (iii) Compensation for Pain and Sufferings: The Petitioner stated that for the above said injuries, he took treatment as inpatient in Vellore Government Medical College Hospital, Adukkambarai for 50 days and internal fixation done . Hence, this Tribunal considers, to award Rs.20,000/­ as just compensation under the head of Pain and Sufferings. /12/ (iv) Transport Charges: The petitioner took treatment as inpatient in Vellore Government Medical College Hospital, Adukkambarai for 50 days . Hence, this Tribunal considering the place of accident and distance to hospital considers, to award Rs.5,000/­ will be just compensation under the head of Transport Charges. (v) Medical Expenses: The petitioner has not filed any Medical Bills. Since the petitioner took treatment in the Government Hospital, this Tribunal is inclined to award no amount towards Medical Expenses. (vi) Extra­nourishment: The petitioner stated that he took treatment as inpatient in Vellore Government Medical College Hospital, Adukkambarai for 50 days. Hence, this Tribunal decides to award Rs.20,000/­ towards Extra­nourishment.

(viii) Loss of Earning: The petitioner in his petition and chief proof affidavit stated that he is not able to continue his job because of the injuries sustained by him. The Petitioner has not marked any document to prove that he is not continuing his job. Due to the above said injuries, the petitioner might not have attended his work for at least 3 months. Hence, this Tribunal is inclined to compensate a sum of Rs.21,000/­ towards loss of earnings during the period of treatment and recuperation. (ix) Loss of future Prospects: The PW1 has stated that due to the injuries sustained by him, he is not able to continue his job because of the injuries sustained by him and he is not doing any job due to his disability. Hence the petitioner is entitled for any amount towards Loss of future Prospects. But the petitioner has not produced any documentary and oral evidence to prove that due to the injury sustained by the petitioner, his future life is affected. /14/ Hence,Rs.20,000/­ is awarded towards loss of future prospects.

Natarajan, B.Sc., B.L., I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Vellore. Tuesday, the 10th day of January, 2017. M.C.O.P.No. 371/2015 1. Ravi 2. Rekha 3. Revathy .. Petitioners. /Vs/ 1. S. Ravichandiran `2. United India Insurance Co. Ltd., Rep. by its Divisional Manager, Vellore... Respondents. This petition, coming up for final hearing before me, on 20.12.2016, in the presence of Thiruvalargal R.A. Murugananthan and P. Subramaniyan, Advocates for the Petitioners and Thiru. N.S. Ramanathan, counsel for the 2nd respondent and the 1st Respondent remained absent and set exparte and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court doth delivereth the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 3. Name of deceased Person : Shanthi 4. Age of the person dead : 40 years 5. Occupation : House wife and mason worker 6. Income pleaded : Rs.12,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 14.3.2014 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.20,00,000/- 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the husband and daughters of the deceased Shanthi who died in a road accident. That on 14.3.2014 at about 5.30 P.M, while the deceased carefully crossing the road, at Ariyur Railway gate near Om Sakthi Koil opposite, the Hero Honda SD CD 100 two wheeler 2 bearing Regn.No. TN-33-E-3604, owned by the 1st respondent was ridden by Mr. Vishal in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and as a result of the accident the deceased was thrown out for 10 feet distance and sustained multiple injuries all over the body and immediately she was taken to Government Hospital at Vellore and Doctors declared she was already died. The accident was reported to Bagayam P olice and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 68/2014, u/s. 279 & 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident the deceased was hale and healthy and working as house wife and Mason worker and earned Rs.12,000- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs.20,00,000/- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 2nd RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. The 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in slow and careful manner following all traffic rules. But the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent act of the deceased and not due to the rash driving of the driver of the 1st respondent. The deceased also contribute negligence to the accident. The rider of two wheeler was minor and not eligible to drive any vehicle and to get driving license to drive the vehicle involved in the accident and it was violation of terms of Insurance policy and hence this Respondent is not liable to pay the compensation amount. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of the rider of the 1st respondent ? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner examined as PW1 and Govindammal examined as PW2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P.7 marked on the side of the Petitioners. Mr. Sridhar, Assistant, of the 2nd Respondent examined as RW1 and through him Ex.R1 marked. POINT NO.1 6. It is admitted fact the 1st Respondent is the owner of the two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-23-E-3604 which involved in the accident on 14.3.2014 and Mr. Vishal was 3 the riding the two wheeler at the time of accident. The petitioner contended the two wheeler was ridden by its rider in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. But, the 2nd Respondent contended that the rider of the two wheeler drove in a slow and careful manner and the accident was happened due to the negligent act of the deceased, since she suddenly crossed the road without noticing the vehicles on the road. The two wheeler was inspected by the MVI and issued the Ex.P.3, M.V.I. report stating there was no mechanical defect in the offending vehicle. Since, the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident as pleaded by the claimants and there was no mechanical defect in the offending vehicle, we have to decide whether the 1st Respondent's driver is responsible for the accident and there was any contributory negligence on the part of deceased. 7. The P.W.1 deposed that on 14.3.2014 at about 5.30 P.M, after the completion of Mason work at Ariyur, while the deceased was carefully crossing the road, at Ariyur Railway gate near Om Sakthi Koil opposite, the Hero Honda SD CD 100 two wheeler bearing Regn.No. TN-33-E-3604, owned by the 1st respondent was ridden by Mr. Vishal in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and as a result of the accident the deceased the thrown out for 10 feet distance and sustained multiple injuries all over the body and immediately she was taken to Government Hospital at Vellore and Doctors declared she was already died. The P.W.1 not seen the accident directly and hence the P.W.1 evidence is not sufficient to prove the manner of accident. 8. The P.W.2 examined as occurrence witness and she deposed that on 14.3.2014 at about 5.30 P.M, when she and others, including the deceased after completing the Meson work, while returning to house, they have crossed the road and the deceased also crossed the road in a careful manner and at that time the rider of two wheeler belonged to 1st Respondent rode it in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and due to accident the deceased was thrown out to 10 feet distance and she sustained multiple injuries all over the body. During cross examination, he admitted that the accident was occurred when the deceased was crossing the road. 9. The accident was reported to Bagayam police station and they have registered a case in Cr.No.68/2014 for offence u/s 279 & 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and wherein also it was stated the rider of the two wheeler rode the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. After investigation the 4 police have filed the charge sheet against the rider of two wheeler and this fact proved from Ex.P. 4 charge sheet. The 2nd Respondent contended that the deceased also contributed negligence to the accident. The contributory negligence is a sharing of responsibility for damage where a person suffers damage as a result partly of his own fault and partly of the fault of any other person. The 2nd Respondent has not put the rider of the offending two wheeler into the witness box to state as to how accident occurred and to depose that he was not at fault and was not driving the vehicle in rash and negligent manner or about the allegation of contributory negligence. In Ex.P1 FIR it is stated the rider dashed against the deceased who has fully crossed the road. There was no evidence to prove the accident was occurred in the middle of the road. More over, the P.W. 2 deposed that at the place of accident the road was so broad and it shows that if the rider take little care the accident would have been avoided. Therefore, it is decided the 2nd Respondent not proved the allegation of contributory negligence and the accident was occurred only due to rash and negligent riding of the two wheeler by its rider Vishal. Point No.2: 10. The 1st petitioner is the husband and 2nd and 3rd petitioners are the daughters and this fact was proved through Ex.P.6 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein the Doctor noted the following External and internal Injuries:- 1. Contused abrasions left temple, jaw, both sides of chest. 2. Right kidney shows multiple lacerations. 3. Fracture of last 3 ribs on the right side in the back. 4. Sub-scalpal contusion in the frontoparietal region. 5. Marked subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage both cerebral hemispheres. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries. 11. It is already decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler by its rider. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in accident. The first Respondent insured the vehicle with the 2nd Respondent and the insurance was in force on the date of accident and this fact was proved through Ex.P.7 copy of Insurance Policy certificate. 5 PAY AND RECOVER 12. The 2nd Respondent contended the rider of the two wheeler was minor at the time of accident and not eligible to ride two wheeler and no license was issued to him. The R.W.1 deposed that the rider not eligible to get driving license as per section 181 of the M.V. Act and the 1st Respondent allowed the ineligible person to ride the two wheeler and it is violation of terms of policy condition. The Ex.R1 is the M.V.I. report with summon order seizing the two wheeler for the reason that the owner allowed to ride it by minor person. The 2nd Respondent has established the fact that the rider of two wheeler belonged to the 1st Respondent was minor person and not eligible to drive any type of vehicle. In the ruling reported in ICICI Lombard General Insurance Vs. Annakkili, 2012 (1) TNMAC 226 it was decided the Insurer cannot be exonerated from paying compensation to third party claimant for the reasons of the driver had no license or Badge and there was illegality in directing insurer to pay and recover from insured. The same legal position was reiterated in another ruling in National Insurance Company Vs. T.Mathiazhagan, 2012 (1) TNMAC 536, and wherein the Insurance company proved the driver has no valid driving license and the Tribunal ordered pay and recover against Insurance company and it was decided in the case of Non-possession of effective driving license the Tribunal has rightly directed insurance to pay compensation and recover same from owner. In the circumstances, this Tribunal has sincerely obeyed the above rulings and conclude that the pay and recovery method is applicable to the present case. AGE 13. The claimants not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of deceased person. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 40 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report the approximate age of deceased was recorded as 40 years. Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximate age recorded in Ex.P.2 Postmortem Certificate treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 40 years at the time of accident. REIMBURSEMENT OF MEDICAL BILLS:- 14. The deceased was died before reaching to Government Hospital, Vellore . Hence there was no medical expenditure and hence no amount was awarded under this head. 6 INCOME 15. The petitioners claimed Rs.20,00,000/- as compensation. The P.W. 1 deposed the deceased doing Mason work and also looking the family as house wife and earned Rs. 12,000/-per month. The P.W.2 deposed that on 14.3.2014 the deceased also worked as Mason along with her and the accident was occurred while they return to home and it proved the deceased was Mason worker. The P.W. 2 further deposed that they get wages of Rs. 300 or 400/- per day. Considering the deceased was Mason worker and t he socio- economic condition forced to any individual to earn at the rate of Rs.300/- per day for living. This court also consider the citation in APSRTC Ltd -Vs- Bharatahy & others, 2015(3) TNLJ 182 (CIVIL), in para 8 it is decided the daily income of carpenter assessed by the Tribunal at Rs. 300/- per day and monthly income of Rs. 9,000/- was not high. In the ruling reported in Managing Director, TNSTC vs Thahira & 3 others, 2016 (2) TNMAC 611 also it is held the notional income fixed by tribunal at Rs. 9,000/- was not excessive. Considering the above legal position , this Tribunal has fixed the monthly income of deceased person as Rs.9,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 16. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. Recently in a ruling reported in in Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (2) TNMAC 55(SC): 2013 (9) SCC 54 , it was decided future prospects applicable in a case of self-employed persons also. The annual income of the deceased was Rs.9,000x12 = Rs. 1,08,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased was 40 years at the time of accident, 30% of income added towards future prospects and the monthly income arrived to Rs. 9,000 + 2700 = 11,700/-. Deductions: 17. The deceased was married person at the time of accident. There are 3 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/3rd of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/3rd deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs.11,700 – 3900 – 7,800/- per month. 7 MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF DEPENDENCY 18. Considering the age of the deceased is 40 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 15 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore the loss of dependency calculated to Rs.7800x12x15 Rs.14,04,000/-. COMPENSATION FOR CONSORTIUM AND LOVE AND AFFECTION CONSORTIUM 19. In Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2009 (2) TN MAC 36 (SC) and followed in Shashikala & another -Vs- Gangalakshmamana & another , 2015 (1) TN MAC 785 (SC) it has held that “Loss of consortium is usually for loss for spouse’s affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations for future years and in such circumstances, Courts to award at least Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation for Loss of Consortium” and this position followed in Reliance General Insurance Co Ltd -Vs-K.Meena & others, 2015 (2) TNMAC 449 .

The petitioners are the husband and daughters of the deceased and they have lost their love & affection of the deceased and it is not measurable by money. However, a small amount of Rs.1,00,000/- is considered in the lumpsum calculation towards love and affection. Funeral Expenses : 21. Decent burial is also one on the right under Art 21 of our constitution, The petitioner has failed to produce any expenditure statement relating to the funeral expenses, so the tribunal has awarded a minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- for the head, also relied the Judgment in Rajesh v. Rajbir singh [CDJ 2013 SC 485], the Hon’ble apex court has further held that “ Funeral expenses not only includes fee paid in crematorium or cementary but also includes religious practices and conventions performed on death in 8 family. Hence in absence of any evidence to contrary, minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- to be awarded by Courts towards funeral expenses ”. Hence, a sum of Rs,25,000/- alone was considered and fixed the award in lumpsum manner. Loss of Estate, Transport Expenses and damages for articles:- 22. This Tribunal considered future prospects and 30% of income added towards future prospects. Hence, this Tribunal not awarded any under the head of Loss of Estate. The petitioner not produced any documentary evidence showing the actual expenses for transport expenses. However, this Tribunal awarded Rs. 5000/- towards transport expenses.

Natarajan, B.Sc., B.L., I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Vellore. Tuesday, the 4th day of April, 2017. M.C.O.P.No. 590/ 2015 1. C. Kathirvelu 2. R. Megala 3. K. Venkatraman 4. K. Gokul Raman .. Petitioners. /Vs/ 1. D. Suresh `2. D.G. Praveen Kumar .. Respondents. This petition, coming up for final hearing before me, on 2.3.2017, in the presence of Thiru. N. Sankar, Advocate for the Petitioners and Thiru. A. Karthikeyan, counsel for the 1st respondent and Thiruvalargal. A. Kamalanathan and P. Ramesh, Advocates, appeared for the 2nd Respondent and remained absent and hence set exparte and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court doth delivereth the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 3. Name of deceased Person : K. Kuppu 4. Age of the person dead : 51 years 5. Occupation : Attender Higher Grade, BHEL Ranipet, 6. Income pleaded : Rs. 63,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 23.11.2014 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.1,00,00,000/- 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the Husband, Daughter and sons of the deceased Kuppu who died in a road accident. That on 2 23.11.2014 at about 1.00 P.M, while the deceased was travelling as pillion rider in a two wheeler ridden by her son, the 1st Respondent ride the two wheeler bearing Reg.No.AP- 03-BE-2134 in a rash and negligent manner and endangering the human life from opposite direction on the Chittoor – Tirupathi road, hit against the deceased and she sustained fatal injuries and immediately she was taken to Government Hospital at Chittoor and inspite of treatment she succumbed to death due to the injuries sustained in the accident. The accident was reported to N.R. Pet P olice Station and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 53/2014, u/s. 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and working as Higher Grade Attender and earned Rs.63,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs.1,00,00,000/- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 1st RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. The relationship of the claimants with the deceased and right to claim compensation was denied. The allegation that the 1st Respondent ride the two wheeler was denied. This Respondent never ride the two wheeler in a rash and negligent manner. The accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-73-D-6676 by one Venkataraman carrying the deceased as pillion rider and dashed against the two wheeler ridden by this Respondent. Hence this Respondent not liable to pay any compensation to the petitioners. The owner and Insurance company of the two wheeler ride by Venkataraman are necessary parties and this application is bad for non-joinder of necessary parties. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of the rider, the 1st respondent ? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 3rd petitioner examined as PW1 and Mr. Jayaprakash, the Deputy General Manager, BHEL, Ranipet, examined as PW2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P. 11 and Ex.X.1 to Ex.X.3 marked on the side of the Petitioners. No oral evidence for the 1st Respondent. The copy of judgments delivered by III-Additional Judicial Magistrate, I class, Chittoor, marked as Ex.R.1. 3 POINT NO.1: 6. It is admitted fact the 2nd Respondent is the owner of the two wheeler bearing Reg.No. AP-03-BE-2134, which involved in the accident and 1st Respondent ride the offending vehicle at the time of accident. It is the case of petitioners that the 1st Respondent ride the offending vehicle in rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased, while she travelling as pillion rider in a two wheeler ride by the P.W.1. But, the 1st Respondent contended that he ride the offending vehicle in slow and careful manner and the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligence riding of two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-73-D-6676 and dashed against the two wheeler ride by the 1st Respondent. The offending vehicle was inspected by the MVI, and issued the Ex.P.6, M.V.I. report stating the accident was not occurred due to mechanical defect in the offending vehicle. The damages noted in Ex.P.6, M.V.I. report proved the involvement of two wheeler ride by the 1st Respondent. In this case the accident was admitted and the manner of accident alone disputed. Since, there was no mechanical defect in the vehicle and the 1st Respondent denied the manner of accident, irrespective of whether criminal prosecution launched or not, and irrespective of its result, the claimants has to prove the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler by the 1st Respondent before this Tribunal. So, we have to decide whether the claimants have proved the rash and negligence riding of two wheeler by the 1st Respondent was proved. 7. It is also settled law that the term rashness and negligence has to be construed lightly while making a decision on a petition for claim for the same as compared to the word rashness and negligence as mention in the Indian Penal Code . This is because the chapter in the Motor Vehicle Act dealing with compensation is a benevolent legislation and not a penal one. Minding this legal principle we have to consider whether the claimants have proved the negligent riding of offending two wheeler by the 1st Respondent. 8. The P.W.1 deposed that on 23.11.2014 at about 1.00 P.M, he ride the two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-73-D-6676, along with the deceased as a pillion rider, on Chittor to Tiruthani road, at Lalapettai in a slow and careful manner, the 1st Respondent ride the two wheeler bearing Reg.No.AP-03-BE-2134 in a rash and negligent manner and endangering the human life from opposite direction and hit against the two wheeler and hence the deceased and he sustained fatal injuries and immediately she was taken to Government Hospital at Chittoor and inspite of treatment that her mother was died at 2.15 4 P.M. The P.W.1 lodged complaint to N.R. Pet P olice Station, A.P State, and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 53/2014, u/s. 304(A) of IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and Telungu version of complaint marked as Ex.P.2 and the English translated copy marked as Ex.P. 3, wherein also it was stated the 1st Respondent ride the two wheeler in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler wherein the deceased travelled as pillion rider. After investigation the police filed charge sheet against the 1st Respondent and this fact proved through the Ex.P.4 copy of charge sheet. After trial the 1st Respondent was acquitted and copy of the judgment marked as Ex.R. 1. During trial before the learned Judicial Magistrate court, at Chittoor, the 1st Respondent disputed the identification and the perusal of Ex.R.1 revealed the 1st Respondent was acquitted by giving benefit of doubt. 9. The 1st Respondent is the competent person to deposed regarding the manner of accident. The 1st Respondent has not enter into the witness box to state as to how accident occurred and to depose that he was not at fault and was not driving the vehicle in rash and negligent manner. On the other hand the P.W.1 evidence proved the accident was occurred only due to rash and negligent riding of offending two wheeler by the 1st Respondent. Hence, it is decided the accident was occurred only due to rash and negligent riding of 1st Respondent. Point No.2: 10. The 1st petitioner is the husband, 2nd petitioner is daughter and 3rd and 4th petitioners are sons of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.7 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.5 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein the Doctor noted the following External Injuries:- 1. Total open fracture of right leg with rupture of muscles. 2. Massive laceration of left thigh with rupture of thigh muscles. 3. Rupture of left great toe. The Doctor also noted the following Internal Injuries:- 1. Fracture of right tibia with rupture of leg muscles. 2. Fracture of left femur with rupture of thigh muscles and vessels. 3. Rupture of left great toe muscles. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died of Massive fracture and hemorrhagic shock. 5 11. It is already decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent. The Ex.P.5 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in accident. The 2nd Respondent is the owner of the offending two wheeler and not insured the vehicle. Hence, the Respondents are liable to pay compensation to the claimants. AGE :- 12. The age of deceased mentioned as 51 years in claim application. The deceased worked as attender Higher Grade. The birth certificate of deceased not marked. The Ex.P.9 is the Identification card issued from BHEL, Ranipet. The Ex.P.10 is the PAN card of the deceased. In Ex.P.9 and 10, the date of birth of the deceased mentioned as 16.7.1963 and proved the deceased was 51 years, 4 months, 7 days and she crossed the age of 51 and hence the age of deceased was fixed to 52 years at the time of accident. MEDICAL EXPENDITURE AND PAIN AND SUFFERINGS:- 13. Immediate to the accident the injured taken to Government Hospital, Chittoor and died on the same day. Therefore, this Tribunal not awarded any sum under these heads. INCOME :- 14. The petitioners claimed Rs. 1,00,00,000/- as compensation. The P.W.1 deposed the deceased was working as Attender, Higher Grade, at BHEL, Ranipet, at the time of accident and earned Rs.63,000/- per month. The P.W.2 working as Deputy General Manager and deposed that the deceased was working in BHEL, in employment No. 4154541 and for the month 2014, she draw monthly salary of Rs. 61,440/- and the salary bill marked as Ex.X.2. As per the Ex.X.2, salary bill, the Gross salary of the deceased was Rs. 61,449/- and the annual income was Rs. 61,449x12 = 7,37,388/-. The Ex.X.3 is the FORM No. 16, issued for the deceased by the BHEL and it proved the Gross income of the deceased was Rs. 15,35,765/- and she paid Income tax of Rs. 11,311/- and after deduction of Income tax, the Income of the deceased was Rs. 15,24,454/-. The perusal of Ex.X. 3 proved that on account of death, some terminal benefits also included in Ex.X.3 Form-16. Hence, it is decided the Ex.X.3 not relevant to decide the actual income of the deceased. The actual annual salary income of the deceased was Rs. 7,37,388/-. After deduction of Income tax paid for deceased the net annual salary income was Rs. 7,37,388 – 11311 = 7,26,077/-. Hence, the annual salary income of the deceased arrived to Rs. 7,26,077/-. 6 FUTURE PROSPECTS 15. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546 , the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary, to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. The deceased was 52 years at the time of accident and hence future prospects not applicable for this case. Deductions: 16. The deceased was married person at the time of accident. There are 4 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/4th salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/4th deduction the annual income of the deceased fixed as Rs. 7,26,077 – 1,81,519 = 5,44,558/-. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF DEPENDENCY 17. Considering the age of the deceased is 52 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 11 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore t he “loss of dependency” to the family is arrived to Rs. 544558X11 = 59,90,138/-. COMPENSATION FOR CONSORTIUM AND LOVE AND AFFECTION CONSORTIUM 18. In Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2009 (2) TN MAC 36 (SC) and followed in Shashikala & another -Vs- Gangalakshmamana & another , 2015 (1) TN MAC 785 (SC) it has held that “Loss of consortium is usually for loss for spouse’s affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations for future years and in such circumstances, Courts to award at least Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation for Loss of Consortium” and this position followed in Reliance General Insurance Co Ltd -Vs-K.Meena & others, 2015 (2) TNMAC 449 .

Decent burial is also one on the right under Art 21 of our constitution, The petitioners have failed to produce any expenditure statement relating to the funeral expenses, so the tribunal has awarded a minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- for the head, also relied the Judgment in Rajesh v. Rajbir singh [CDJ 2013 SC 485], the Hon’ble apex court has further held that “ Funeral expenses not only includes fee paid in crematorium or cementary but also includes religious practices and conventions performed on death in family. Hence in absence of any evidence to contrary, minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- to be awarded by Courts towards funeral expenses ”. Hence, a sum of Rs.25,000/- alone was considered and fixed the award in lumpsum manner. Loss of Estate, Transport Expenses and damages for articles:- 21.

Natarajan, B.Sc., B.L., I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Vellore. Tuesday, the 4th day of April, 2017. M.C.O.P.No. 590/ 2015 1. C. Kathirvelu 2. R. Megala 3. K. Venkatraman 4. K. Gokul Raman .. Petitioners. /Vs/ 1. D. Suresh `2. D.G. Praveen Kumar .. Respondents. This petition, coming up for final hearing before me, on 2.3.2017, in the presence of Thiru. N. Sankar, Advocate for the Petitioners and Thiru. A. Karthikeyan, counsel for the 1st respondent and Thiruvalargal. A. Kamalanathan and P. Ramesh, Advocates, appeared for the 2nd Respondent and remained absent and hence set exparte and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court doth delivereth the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 3. Name of deceased Person : K. Kuppu 4. Age of the person dead : 51 years 5. Occupation : Attender Higher Grade, BHEL Ranipet, 6. Income pleaded : Rs. 63,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 23.11.2014 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.1,00,00,000/- 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the Husband, Daughter and sons of the deceased Kuppu who died in a road accident. That on 2 23.11.2014 at about 1.00 P.M, while the deceased was travelling as pillion rider in a two wheeler ridden by her son, the 1st Respondent ride the two wheeler bearing Reg.No.AP- 03-BE-2134 in a rash and negligent manner and endangering the human life from opposite direction on the Chittoor – Tirupathi road, hit against the deceased and she sustained fatal injuries and immediately she was taken to Government Hospital at Chittoor and inspite of treatment she succumbed to death due to the injuries sustained in the accident. The accident was reported to N.R. Pet P olice Station and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 53/2014, u/s. 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and working as Higher Grade Attender and earned Rs.63,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs.1,00,00,000/- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 1st RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. The relationship of the claimants with the deceased and right to claim compensation was denied. The allegation that the 1st Respondent ride the two wheeler was denied. This Respondent never ride the two wheeler in a rash and negligent manner. The accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-73-D-6676 by one Venkataraman carrying the deceased as pillion rider and dashed against the two wheeler ridden by this Respondent. Hence this Respondent not liable to pay any compensation to the petitioners. The owner and Insurance company of the two wheeler ride by Venkataraman are necessary parties and this application is bad for non-joinder of necessary parties. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of the rider, the 1st respondent ? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 3rd petitioner examined as PW1 and Mr. Jayaprakash, the Deputy General Manager, BHEL, Ranipet, examined as PW2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P. 11 and Ex.X.1 to Ex.X.3 marked on the side of the Petitioners. No oral evidence for the 1st Respondent. The copy of judgments delivered by III-Additional Judicial Magistrate, I class, Chittoor, marked as Ex.R.1. 3 POINT NO.1: 6. It is admitted fact the 2nd Respondent is the owner of the two wheeler bearing Reg.No. AP-03-BE-2134, which involved in the accident and 1st Respondent ride the offending vehicle at the time of accident. It is the case of petitioners that the 1st Respondent ride the offending vehicle in rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased, while she travelling as pillion rider in a two wheeler ride by the P.W.1. But, the 1st Respondent contended that he ride the offending vehicle in slow and careful manner and the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligence riding of two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-73-D-6676 and dashed against the two wheeler ride by the 1st Respondent. The offending vehicle was inspected by the MVI, and issued the Ex.P.6, M.V.I. report stating the accident was not occurred due to mechanical defect in the offending vehicle. The damages noted in Ex.P.6, M.V.I. report proved the involvement of two wheeler ride by the 1st Respondent. In this case the accident was admitted and the manner of accident alone disputed. Since, there was no mechanical defect in the vehicle and the 1st Respondent denied the manner of accident, irrespective of whether criminal prosecution launched or not, and irrespective of its result, the claimants has to prove the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler by the 1st Respondent before this Tribunal. So, we have to decide whether the claimants have proved the rash and negligence riding of two wheeler by the 1st Respondent was proved. 7. It is also settled law that the term rashness and negligence has to be construed lightly while making a decision on a petition for claim for the same as compared to the word rashness and negligence as mention in the Indian Penal Code . This is because the chapter in the Motor Vehicle Act dealing with compensation is a benevolent legislation and not a penal one. Minding this legal principle we have to consider whether the claimants have proved the negligent riding of offending two wheeler by the 1st Respondent. 8. The P.W.1 deposed that on 23.11.2014 at about 1.00 P.M, he ride the two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-73-D-6676, along with the deceased as a pillion rider, on Chittor to Tiruthani road, at Lalapettai in a slow and careful manner, the 1st Respondent ride the two wheeler bearing Reg.No.AP-03-BE-2134 in a rash and negligent manner and endangering the human life from opposite direction and hit against the two wheeler and hence the deceased and he sustained fatal injuries and immediately she was taken to Government Hospital at Chittoor and inspite of treatment that her mother was died at 2.15 4 P.M. The P.W.1 lodged complaint to N.R. Pet P olice Station, A.P State, and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 53/2014, u/s. 304(A) of IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and Telungu version of complaint marked as Ex.P.2 and the English translated copy marked as Ex.P. 3, wherein also it was stated the 1st Respondent ride the two wheeler in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler wherein the deceased travelled as pillion rider. After investigation the police filed charge sheet against the 1st Respondent and this fact proved through the Ex.P.4 copy of charge sheet. After trial the 1st Respondent was acquitted and copy of the judgment marked as Ex.R. 1. During trial before the learned Judicial Magistrate court, at Chittoor, the 1st Respondent disputed the identification and the perusal of Ex.R.1 revealed the 1st Respondent was acquitted by giving benefit of doubt. 9. The 1st Respondent is the competent person to deposed regarding the manner of accident. The 1st Respondent has not enter into the witness box to state as to how accident occurred and to depose that he was not at fault and was not driving the vehicle in rash and negligent manner. On the other hand the P.W.1 evidence proved the accident was occurred only due to rash and negligent riding of offending two wheeler by the 1st Respondent. Hence, it is decided the accident was occurred only due to rash and negligent riding of 1st Respondent. Point No.2: 10. The 1st petitioner is the husband, 2nd petitioner is daughter and 3rd and 4th petitioners are sons of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.7 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.5 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein the Doctor noted the following External Injuries:- 1. Total open fracture of right leg with rupture of muscles. 2. Massive laceration of left thigh with rupture of thigh muscles. 3. Rupture of left great toe. The Doctor also noted the following Internal Injuries:- 1. Fracture of right tibia with rupture of leg muscles. 2. Fracture of left femur with rupture of thigh muscles and vessels. 3. Rupture of left great toe muscles. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died of Massive fracture and hemorrhagic shock. 5 11. It is already decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent. The Ex.P.5 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in accident. The 2nd Respondent is the owner of the offending two wheeler and not insured the vehicle. Hence, the Respondents are liable to pay compensation to the claimants. AGE :- 12. The age of deceased mentioned as 51 years in claim application. The deceased worked as attender Higher Grade. The birth certificate of deceased not marked. The Ex.P.9 is the Identification card issued from BHEL, Ranipet. The Ex.P.10 is the PAN card of the deceased. In Ex.P.9 and 10, the date of birth of the deceased mentioned as 16.7.1963 and proved the deceased was 51 years, 4 months, 7 days and she crossed the age of 51 and hence the age of deceased was fixed to 52 years at the time of accident. MEDICAL EXPENDITURE AND PAIN AND SUFFERINGS:- 13. Immediate to the accident the injured taken to Government Hospital, Chittoor and died on the same day. Therefore, this Tribunal not awarded any sum under these heads. INCOME :- 14. The petitioners claimed Rs. 1,00,00,000/- as compensation. The P.W.1 deposed the deceased was working as Attender, Higher Grade, at BHEL, Ranipet, at the time of accident and earned Rs.63,000/- per month. The P.W.2 working as Deputy General Manager and deposed that the deceased was working in BHEL, in employment No. 4154541 and for the month 2014, she draw monthly salary of Rs. 61,440/- and the salary bill marked as Ex.X.2. As per the Ex.X.2, salary bill, the Gross salary of the deceased was Rs. 61,449/- and the annual income was Rs. 61,449x12 = 7,37,388/-. The Ex.X.3 is the FORM No. 16, issued for the deceased by the BHEL and it proved the Gross income of the deceased was Rs. 15,35,765/- and she paid Income tax of Rs. 11,311/- and after deduction of Income tax, the Income of the deceased was Rs. 15,24,454/-. The perusal of Ex.X. 3 proved that on account of death, some terminal benefits also included in Ex.X.3 Form-16. Hence, it is decided the Ex.X.3 not relevant to decide the actual income of the deceased. The actual annual salary income of the deceased was Rs. 7,37,388/-. After deduction of Income tax paid for deceased the net annual salary income was Rs. 7,37,388 – 11311 = 7,26,077/-. Hence, the annual salary income of the deceased arrived to Rs. 7,26,077/-. 6 FUTURE PROSPECTS 15. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546 , the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary, to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. The deceased was 52 years at the time of accident and hence future prospects not applicable for this case. Deductions: 16. The deceased was married person at the time of accident. There are 4 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/4th salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/4th deduction the annual income of the deceased fixed as Rs. 7,26,077 – 1,81,519 = 5,44,558/-. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF DEPENDENCY 17. Considering the age of the deceased is 52 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 11 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore t he “loss of dependency” to the family is arrived to Rs. 544558X11 = 59,90,138/-. COMPENSATION FOR CONSORTIUM AND LOVE AND AFFECTION CONSORTIUM 18. In Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2009 (2) TN MAC 36 (SC) and followed in Shashikala & another -Vs- Gangalakshmamana & another , 2015 (1) TN MAC 785 (SC) it has held that “Loss of consortium is usually for loss for spouse’s affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations for future years and in such circumstances, Courts to award at least Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation for Loss of Consortium” and this position followed in Reliance General Insurance Co Ltd -Vs-K.Meena & others, 2015 (2) TNMAC 449 . The 1st petitioner is husband and aged about 59 years at the time of the accident, which is the crucial period, at which time he very needed the companionship of his wife and for which Rs.1,00,000/- is awarded. 7 Loss of Love & affection & Mental Agony and loss of Expectancy of life : 19.

The petitioners 2 to 4 are the daughter and sons of the deceased and they have lost their love & affection of the deceased and it is not measurable by money. However, a small amount of Rs.1,00,000/- is considered in the lumpsum calculation towards love and affection. Funeral Expenses : 20. Decent burial is also one on the right under Art 21 of our constitution, The petitioners have failed to produce any expenditure statement relating to the funeral expenses, so the tribunal has awarded a minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- for the head, also relied the Judgment in Rajesh v. Rajbir singh [CDJ 2013 SC 485], the Hon’ble apex court has further held that “ Funeral expenses not only includes fee paid in crematorium or cementary but also includes religious practices and conventions performed on death in family. Hence in absence of any evidence to contrary, minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- to be awarded by Courts towards funeral expenses ”. Hence, a sum of Rs.25,000/- alone was considered and fixed the award in lumpsum manner. Loss of Estate, Transport Expenses and damages for articles:- 21. This Tribunal not considered future prospects and hence, this Tribunal awarded Rs. 50,000/- towards loss of estate. The petitioners have not produced any documentary evidence showing the actual expenses for transport expenses. However, this Tribunal awarded Rs. 5000/- towards transport expenses. The petitioners not accounted for the actual damages caused in accident. Hence, this Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs. 2000/- towards damage to clothes and articles. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 59,90,138 2.Loss of consortium ...Rs. 1,00,000 3.Loss of Love & Affection …Rs. 1,00,000 4.Loss of estate ...Rs. 50,000 5.Medical Expenses …Rs.

The petitioners contended the 1st Respondent drove the offending vehicle in a 3 rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and the deceased sustained multiple grievous injuries and died. But, the 3rd Respondent denied the manner of accident as pleaded by the petitioners and contended that the 1st Respondent drove the vehicle in slow and careful manner and the accident was happened due to the rash and negligence of the deceased. The offending vehicle was inspected by the MVI and issued the Ex.P.3 M.V.I. report stating the tyre condition was satisfactory and the Breaking system was in order and there was no mechanical defect in the offending vehicle. Since, the 3rd Respondent denied the manner of accident as pleaded by the claimants and there was no mechanical defect in the offending vehicle, we have to decide whether the 1st Respondent is responsible for the accident. 7. The P.W.1 deposed that on 2.4.2014 at about 7.00 P.M, on Shenbakkam service road, adjacent to N.H road and opposite to OYASIS swimming pool, when the deceased was walking on the road, the lorry bearing Regn.No. TN-28-AD-8664 was driven by the 1st respondent in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and as a result of the accident, the deceased sustained multiple grievous injuries on all over the body. The P.W.1 has not seen the accident directly and hence the P.W.1 evidence is not sufficient to prove the manner of accident. 8. The P.W. 2 examined as occurrence witness and he deposed that on 2.4.2014 at about 7.00 P.M, on Shenbakkam service road, adjacent to N.H road and opposite to OYASIS swimming pool, when the deceased was walking on the road, the lorry bearing Regn.No. TN-28-AP-8664 was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and as a result of the accident, the deceased sustained multiple grievous injuries on all over the body. The accident was reported to Vellore Taluk police station and they have registered a case in Cr.No. 184/2015 for offence u/s 279 & 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and wherein also it was stated the 1st Respondent drove the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. The 3rd Respondent has not put the 1st Respondent into the witness box to state as to how the accident occurred and to depose that he was not at fault and was not driving the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. On the other hand the P.W.2 evidence proved the accident was occurred due to the rash negligent driving of the 1st respondent. Hence it is decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligence of the 1st Respondent. 4 Point No.2: 9. The 1st petitioner is the wife and the 2nd and 3rd petitioners are the daughters and 4th petitioner is the son and 5th petitioner is the mother of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.5 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein the Doctor noted the following External Injuries:- 1. Reddish brown abrasions : a) 2.5 x 1.8 cm on front of the right forehead; b) 9.3 x 6.5 cm on the back of the right side of the hip; c) imprint abrasion 8.5 x 6.2 cm on the outer aspect of left side of the hip; d) large grazed abrasion 18.2 x 11.5 cm on the front and outer aspect of right thigh; e) multiple small abrasions over an area of 14.5 x 12.5 cm on the front and outer aspect of right foot. 2. Horizontally oblique laceration 2.5 x 1.8 x 1.1 cm on the nasal ridge exposing the underlying irregular completer fracture of nasal bone with surrounding soft tissue contusion and extravasation of blood were present. 3. Vertically oblique laceration 4.5 x 0.8 x 0.8 cm on the right occipital region of the scalp with dark red diffuse contusion of the right parieto occipital region of the calvarium; on opening of the calvarium: Dark red 2.1 cm thick subdural hematoma present on right parietal and bilateral occipital lobes; thin diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage on all over the surface of the brain; Brain: edematous; C/S: Pale. Skull base intact. 4. Swelling and deformity of the pelvis on both sides; on further dissection: irregular comminuted fracture of both pelvic bones with surrounding soft tissues contusion and extravasation of blood to form large retro peritoneal hematoma; Pelvic cavity contained about 650 ml fluid blood. 5. Swelling and deformity of the middle third of the left thigh was present; on further dissection: irregular complete fracture of middle third of left femur with surrounding soft tissues contusion and extravasation of blood were present. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died of shock and hemorrhage due to multiple injuries. 10. It is already decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the injured was died due to the severe injuries sustained in the accident. The 2nd Respondent insured the vehicle with the 3rd Respondent and the insurance was in force on the date of accident and this fact was proved through Ex.P.6 copy of Insurance Policy certificate. The 3rd 5 respondent contended the 2nd respondent not renewed the fitness of the offending vehicle at the time of accident and hence the 3rd respondent not liable to pay the compensation to the claimants. The 3rd respondent send notice to RTO Namakkal office seeking particulars regarding the offending lorry and it was replied through the EX.R3 reply. In Ex.R3 reply it is specifically stated that the fitness was valid till 28.2.2014 and there was no further entries regarding the renewal of validity of fitness. The 3rd Respondent has established the fact that the 2nd respondent not renewed the fitness certificate of the offending vehicle. In the ruling reported in ICICI Lombard General Insurance Vs. Annakkili, 2012 (1) TNMAC 226 it was decided the Insurer cannot be exonerated from paying compensation to third party claimant for the reasons of the driver had no license or Badge and there was illegality in directing insurer to pay and recover from insured. The same legal position was reiterated in another ruling in National Insurance Company Vs. T.Mathiazhagan, 2012 (1) TNMAC 536, and wherein the Insurance company proved the driver has no valid driving license and the Tribunal ordered pay and recover against Insurance company and it was decided in the case of Non-possession of effective driving license the Tribunal has rightly directed insurance to pay compensation and recover same from owner. In the circumstances, this Tribunal comes to conclusion the said legal position also applicable when the owner not renewed the fitness certificate and hence this tribunal has sincerely obeyed the above rulings and conclude that the pay and recovery method is applicable to the present case. AGE 11. The claimants not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of deceased person. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 46 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report the age of deceased was appeared to be 48 years. Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximately the age recorded in Ex.P.2 Postmortem Certificate treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 48 years at the time of accident. MEDICAL EXPENSES:- 12. Immediate to the accident the injured has been admitted in CMC Hospital, Vellore and died on the same day. However, the petitioners not produced documents regarding the medical expenses meted out by them. Hence, no amount was awarded under this head. 6 INCOME 13. The petitioners claimed Rs. 25,00,000/- as compensation. The P.W. 1 deposed the deceased was working as a Gumastha in night hours at whole sale vegetable mundies at Nethaji Market at the time of accident and earned Rs.25,000/- per month. There was no evidence to show the income proof. The socio-economic condition forced to any individual to earn at the rate of Rs.300/- per day for his living. This court also consider the citation in APSRTC Ltd -Vs- Bharatahy & others, 2015(3) TNLJ 182 (CIVIL), in para 8 it is decided the daily income of carpenter assessed by the Tribunal at Rs. 300/- per day and monthly income of Rs. 9,000/- was not high. Considering the above legal position , this Tribunal has fixed the monthly income of deceased person as Rs.9,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 14. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. Recently in a ruling reported in in Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (2) TNMAC 55(SC): 2013 (9) SCC 54 , it was decided future prospects applicable in a case of self-employed persons also. The annual income of the deceased was Rs.9,000x12=1,08,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased was 48 years at the time of accident, 30% of income added towards future prospects and the monthly income arrived to Rs.9000+ 2700 = 11,700/- per month. Deductions: 15. The deceased was a married person at the time of accident. There are 5 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted ¼th of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After ¼th deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs. 11700 – 2925 = 8775/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 16. Considering the age of the deceased is 48 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 13 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore the loss of dependency calculated to Rs. 8775x12x13=Rs. 13,68,900/-. 7 COMPENSATION FOR CONSORTIUM AND LOVE AND AFFECTION CONSORTIUM 17. In Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2009 (2) TN MAC 36 (SC) and followed in Shashikala & another -Vs- Gangalakshmamana & another , 2015 (1) TN MAC 785 (SC) it has held that “Loss of consortium is usually for loss for spouse’s affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations for future years and in such circumstances, Courts to award at least Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation for Loss of Consortium” and this position followed in Reliance General Insurance Co Ltd -Vs-K.Meena & others, 2015 (2) TNMAC 449 . The 1st petitioner is wife and aged about 42 years at the time of the accident, which is the crucial period, at which time she very needed the companionship of her husband and for which Rs.1,00,000/- is awarded.

The petitioners 2 to 5 are the son, daughter and mother of the deceased and they have lost their love & affection of the deceased and it is not measurable by money. However, a small amount of Rs.1,00,000/- is considered in the lumpsum calculation towards love and affection. Funeral Expenses : 19. Decent burial is also one on the right under Art 21 of our constitution, The petitioner has failed to produced any expenditure statement relating to the funeral expenses, so the tribunal has awarded a minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- for the head, also relied the Judgment in Rajesh v. Rajbir singh [CDJ 2013 SC 485], the Hon’ble apex court has further held that “ Funeral expenses not only includes fee paid in crematorium or cementary but also includes religious practices and conventions performed on death in family. Hence in absence of any evidence to contrary, minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- to be awarded by Courts towards funeral expenses ”. Hence, a sum of Rs,25,000/- alone was considered and fixed the award in lumpsum manner. Loss of Estate, Transport Expenses and damages for articles:- 20. This Tribunal considered future prospects and 30% of income added towards future prospects. Hence, this Tribunal not awarded any under the head of Loss of Estate. 8 The petitioners have not produced any documentary evidence showing the actual expenses for transport expenses.

Dhanabakiyam .. Petitioners. /Vs/ 1. Vijayakumar `2. Padmanaban 3. Bharathi AXA General Insurance Co Ltd., Chennai. .. Respondents. This petition, coming up for final hearing before me, on 10.1.2017, in the presence of Thiru.T.S.Kannaiyan, Advocate for the Petitioners and Thiru. D. Muthukumar, counsel for the 3rd respondent and the Respondents 1 and 2 remained absent and set exparte and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court doth delivereth the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 3. Name of deceased Person : Venkatasan 4. Age of the person dead : 46 years 5. Occupation : Gumastha, during night hours in wholesale Vegetable Mundy. 6. Income pleaded : Rs.25,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 2.4.2015 8. Compensation claimed : Rs. 25,00,000/- 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the wife, daughters, son and mother of the deceased Venkatasan who died in road accident. 2 That on 2.4.2014 at about 7.00 P.M, on Shenbakkam service road, adjacent to N.H road and opposite to OYASIS swimming pool, when the deceased was walking on the road, the lorry bearing Regn.No. TN-28-AP-8664, owned by the 2nd respondent was driven by the 1st respondent in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and as a result of the accident, the deceased sustained multiple grievous injuries on all over the body and immediately he was taken to CMC Hospital, Vellore on the same night and he died at 11.30 P.M. The accident was reported to Vellore Taluk P olice and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 184/2015, u/s. 279 & 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and working as Gumastha during night hours in whole sale vegetable mundies at Nethaji Market at Vellore and earned Rs.25,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs. 25,00,000/- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 3rd RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. The 1st Respondent driver drove the vehicle in slow and careful manner following all traffic rules. But the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent act of the deceased. The 1st Respondent has no valid driving license to drive the vehicle involved in the accident and it was violation of terms of Insurance policy and hence this Respondent is not liable to pay the compensation amount. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver, the 1st respondent? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner examined as PW1 and Mani examined as PW2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P.6 marked on the side of the Petitioners. Mr. Arunachalam examined as RW1 and through him Ex.R1 to R3 marked. POINT NO.1 6. It is admitted fact the 2nd Respondent is the owner of the offending lorry bearing Reg.No. TN-28-AP-8664 and it was driven by 1st respondent as a driver at the time of accident. The petitioners contended the 1st Respondent drove the offending vehicle in a 3 rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and the deceased sustained multiple grievous injuries and died. But, the 3rd Respondent denied the manner of accident as pleaded by the petitioners and contended that the 1st Respondent drove the vehicle in slow and careful manner and the accident was happened due to the rash and negligence of the deceased. The offending vehicle was inspected by the MVI and issued the Ex.P.3 M.V.I. report stating the tyre condition was satisfactory and the Breaking system was in order and there was no mechanical defect in the offending vehicle. Since, the 3rd Respondent denied the manner of accident as pleaded by the claimants and there was no mechanical defect in the offending vehicle, we have to decide whether the 1st Respondent is responsible for the accident. 7. The P.W.1 deposed that on 2.4.2014 at about 7.00 P.M, on Shenbakkam service road, adjacent to N.H road and opposite to OYASIS swimming pool, when the deceased was walking on the road, the lorry bearing Regn.No. TN-28-AD-8664 was driven by the 1st respondent in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and as a result of the accident, the deceased sustained multiple grievous injuries on all over the body. The P.W.1 has not seen the accident directly and hence the P.W.1 evidence is not sufficient to prove the manner of accident. 8. The P.W. 2 examined as occurrence witness and he deposed that on 2.4.2014 at about 7.00 P.M, on Shenbakkam service road, adjacent to N.H road and opposite to OYASIS swimming pool, when the deceased was walking on the road, the lorry bearing Regn.No. TN-28-AP-8664 was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and as a result of the accident, the deceased sustained multiple grievous injuries on all over the body. The accident was reported to Vellore Taluk police station and they have registered a case in Cr.No. 184/2015 for offence u/s 279 & 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and wherein also it was stated the 1st Respondent drove the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. The 3rd Respondent has not put the 1st Respondent into the witness box to state as to how the accident occurred and to depose that he was not at fault and was not driving the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. On the other hand the P.W.2 evidence proved the accident was occurred due to the rash negligent driving of the 1st respondent. Hence it is decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligence of the 1st Respondent. 4 Point No.2: 9. The 1st petitioner is the wife and the 2nd and 3rd petitioners are the daughters and 4th petitioner is the son and 5th petitioner is the mother of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.5 legal heir certificate.

Skull base intact. 4. Swelling and deformity of the pelvis on both sides; on further dissection: irregular comminuted fracture of both pelvic bones with surrounding soft tissues contusion and extravasation of blood to form large retro peritoneal hematoma; Pelvic cavity contained about 650 ml fluid blood. 5. Swelling and deformity of the middle third of the left thigh was present; on further dissection: irregular complete fracture of middle third of left femur with surrounding soft tissues contusion and extravasation of blood were present. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died of shock and hemorrhage due to multiple injuries. 10. It is already decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the injured was died due to the severe injuries sustained in the accident. The 2nd Respondent insured the vehicle with the 3rd Respondent and the insurance was in force on the date of accident and this fact was proved through Ex.P.6 copy of Insurance Policy certificate. The 3rd 5 respondent contended the 2nd respondent not renewed the fitness of the offending vehicle at the time of accident and hence the 3rd respondent not liable to pay the compensation to the claimants. The 3rd respondent send notice to RTO Namakkal office seeking particulars regarding the offending lorry and it was replied through the EX.R3 reply. In Ex.R3 reply it is specifically stated that the fitness was valid till 28.2.2014 and there was no further entries regarding the renewal of validity of fitness. The 3rd Respondent has established the fact that the 2nd respondent not renewed the fitness certificate of the offending vehicle. In the ruling reported in ICICI Lombard General Insurance Vs. Annakkili, 2012 (1) TNMAC 226 it was decided the Insurer cannot be exonerated from paying compensation to third party claimant for the reasons of the driver had no license or Badge and there was illegality in directing insurer to pay and recover from insured. The same legal position was reiterated in another ruling in National Insurance Company Vs. T.Mathiazhagan, 2012 (1) TNMAC 536, and wherein the Insurance company proved the driver has no valid driving license and the Tribunal ordered pay and recover against Insurance company and it was decided in the case of Non-possession of effective driving license the Tribunal has rightly directed insurance to pay compensation and recover same from owner. In the circumstances, this Tribunal comes to conclusion the said legal position also applicable when the owner not renewed the fitness certificate and hence this tribunal has sincerely obeyed the above rulings and conclude that the pay and recovery method is applicable to the present case. AGE 11. The claimants not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of deceased person. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 46 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report the age of deceased was appeared to be 48 years. Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximately the age recorded in Ex.P.2 Postmortem Certificate treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 48 years at the time of accident. MEDICAL EXPENSES:- 12. Immediate to the accident the injured has been admitted in CMC Hospital, Vellore and died on the same day. However, the petitioners not produced documents regarding the medical expenses meted out by them. Hence, no amount was awarded under this head. 6 INCOME 13.

The P.W. 1 deposed the deceased was working as a Gumastha in night hours at whole sale vegetable mundies at Nethaji Market at the time of accident and earned Rs.25,000/- per month. There was no evidence to show the income proof. The socio-economic condition forced to any individual to earn at the rate of Rs.300/- per day for his living. This court also consider the citation in APSRTC Ltd -Vs- Bharatahy & others, 2015(3) TNLJ 182 (CIVIL), in para 8 it is decided the daily income of carpenter assessed by the Tribunal at Rs. 300/- per day and monthly income of Rs. 9,000/- was not high. Considering the above legal position , this Tribunal has fixed the monthly income of deceased person as Rs.9,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 14. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. Recently in a ruling reported in in Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (2) TNMAC 55(SC): 2013 (9) SCC 54 , it was decided future prospects applicable in a case of self-employed persons also. The annual income of the deceased was Rs.9,000x12=1,08,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased was 48 years at the time of accident, 30% of income added towards future prospects and the monthly income arrived to Rs.9000+ 2700 = 11,700/- per month.

5rlvflkps77kv2djpfn1hnaek0 (54).pdf,"1 BEFORE THE MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, VELLORE, VELLORE DISTRICT. (I ADDITIONAL DISTRICT AND SESSIONS COURT, VELLORE.) Present: Thiru S. Natarajan, B.Sc., B.L., I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Vellore. Tuesday, the 25th day of April, 2017. M.C.O.P.No. 119/2015 Estherrani .. Petitioner. /Vs/ 1. Ammaiyappan 2. The Divisional Manager The National Insurance Co. Ltd., .. Respondents. This petition, coming up for final hearing before me, on 12.4.2017 & 24.4.2017 in the presence of Thiru. S.Dakshinamoorthy, Advocate for the Petitioners and Thiru. L. Pandurangan, counsel for the 2nd respondent and 1st Respondent remained absent and set exparte and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court doth delivereth the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 3. Name of deceased Person : John Wilson 4. Age of the person dead : 70 years 5. Occupation : Retired School Teacher, 6. Income pleaded : Rs.18,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 13.8.2014 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.25,00,000/- 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioner is the wife of the deceased John Wilson who died in a road accident. That on 13.8.2014 at about 7.45 P.M, while the deceased was riding two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-23-BB-4403 on Vellore to Chittoor road, near Tamilnadu Vedi Marunthu Niruvanam, at that time the lorry bearing Regn.No. TN-28-AD-0345, owned by the 1st respondent was parked by its driver in middle of the road without signal and hence the deceased dashed against the parked lorry 2 and sustained grievous injury on his head and all parts of the body and died on the spot. The accident was reported to Katpadi P olice and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 267/2014, u/s. 279 & 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and getting pension of Rs.18,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the entire future life of the petitioner fully doomed. Hence, the petitioner has filed this petition claiming Rs.20,00,000/- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 2nd RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. The relationship of the claimant with the deceased and right to claim compensation was denied. The allegation that the 1st Respondent parked the lorry in the middle of the road without parking signal is denied. But the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent act of the deceased. The police has registered the case against the lorry driver falsely without verifying the rash and negligen t act of the deceased. The owner and Insurance company of the two wheeler not impleaded and hence this claim petition not maintainable. The deceased also contribute negligence to the accident. The 1st Respondent not produced the R.C, F.C, Permit, and driving license of his driver. The 1st Respondent's driver has no valid driving license to drive the offending vehicle and it was violation of terms of Insurance policy and hence this Respondent is not liable to pay the compensation amount. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent? 2. Whether the claimant is entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The petitioner examined as PW1 and Mr. Stalin Gerard examined as PW2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P.11 marked on the side of the Petitioners. No oral and documentary evidence for the 2nd Respondent. POINT NO.1 6. It is admitted fact the 1st Respondent is the owner of the lorry bearing Reg.No. TN-28-AD-0345 which involved in the accident and Mr. Venkatesan was acting as driver at the time of accident. It is the case of petitioner that when the deceased was riding two 3 wheeler, the 1st Respondent's driver parked the lorry in the middle of the road without any parking signal, the deceased dashed on the rear side of lorry. But, the 2nd Respondent denied the parking of lorry without any signal as pleaded by petitioner. The offending vehicle was inspected by the MVI, and issued the Ex.P.4 report stating that the accident was occurred not due to mechanical defect. In this case the accident was admitted and the manner of accident alone disputed. Since, there was no mechanical defect in the vehicle and the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident, irrespective of whether criminal prosecution launched or not and its result, the claimants has to prove the parking of lorry by 1st Respondent's driver without any signal in the middle of the road independently before this Tribunal. So, we have to decide whether the claimant has proved the negligence on the part of 1st Respondent's driver and the 2nd Respondent has proved the allegation of contributory negligence on the part of deceased. 7. It is also settled law that the term rashness and negligence has to be construed lightly while making a decision on a petition for claim for the same as compared to the word rashness and negligence as mention in the Indian Penal Code . This is because the chapter in the Motor Vehicle Act dealing with compensation is a benevolent legislation and not a penal one. Minding this legal principle we have to consider whether the claimants has proved the negligence of the 1st Respondent's driver. The P.W.1 deposed that on 13.8.2014 at about 7.45 P.M, while the deceased was riding two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-23-BB-4403 on Vellore to Chittoor road, near Tamilnadu Vedi Marunthu Niruvanam, at that time the lorry bearing Regn.No. TN-28-AD-0345 was parked by its driver in the middle of the road due to break down without signal, lighting indicator light, putting stones around the lorry and hence the deceased dashed against the parked lorry and sustained grievous injury on his head and all parts of the body and died on the spot. The P.W.1 not seen the accident directly and hence the P.W.1 evidence is not sufficient to prove the manner of accident. 8. The P.W. 2 examined as occurrence witness and he deposed that on 13.8.2014 after completing the land registration work at Chittoor, when he returned through his car bearing Reg.No. AP-03-BB—8583 to Vellore, at about 7.45 P.M when nearing Tamilnadu Vedi Marunthu Niruvanam, the deceased was riding two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-23- BB-4403 just front to him and dashed against the parked lorry bearing Regn.No. TN-28- AD-0345 and the said lorry was parked in the middle of the road without lighting indicator 4 light and signals and the accident was occurred due to parking of lorry negligently without following the traffic rules. 9. The P.W. 2 made complaint to Katpadi police station and they have registered a case in Cr.No.267/2014 u/s 279 & 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and wherein also it was stated the 1st Respondent's driver parked the lorry without lighting indicator light and any signal. After investigation the police has filed charge sheet stating the 1st Respondent's driver parked the break down lorry in the middle of the road without any signal and no indicator light and this fact was proved through Ex.P. 5 copy of charge sheet. 10. The 2nd Respondent contended the deceased also contributed negligence to the accident. The contributory negligence is a sharing of responsibility for damage where a person suffers damage as a result partly of his own fault and partly of the fault of any other person. The 1st Respondent's driver was the best person to depose about the allegation of the contributory negligence. The 2nd Respondent has not put the 1st Respondent's driver into the witness box to state as to whether he parked the lorry following traffic rules by lighting indicator lamp, signal. On the other hand the P.W. 2 evidence proved the 1st Respondent's driver parked the lorry without any signal and also not lighted the indicator light. Hence it is decided that there was no contributory negligence on the part of deceased and the accident was occurred only due to parking of lorry in the middle of the road without any signal. Point No.2: 11. The petitioner is the wife of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.3 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein the Doctor noted the following External Injuries:- 1. Multiple Grazed abrasion of varying sizes seen on both face, neck, right side abdomen, right check 2. Laceration 4x2x1 cm over right arm, 3. 5x3 cm contused swelling seen on the posterior occipital region. The Doctor also noted the following Internal Injuries:- 1. Skull: Sub-scalpal contusion on the parieto occipital region. 2. Linear fracture on the occipital region. 3. Marked subdural and subarachonid hemorrhage both cerebral hemisphere. 5 4. Fracture of middle and post cranial fosa. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died of Head injury. 12. It is already decided the accident was occurred only due to the negligent act of 1st Respondent's driver. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in accident. The first Respondent insured the vehicle with the 2nd Respondent and the insurance was in force on the date of accident and this fact was proved through Ex.P.9 copy of Insurance Policy certificate. The 1st Respondent's driver also has valid driving licence to drive the offending vehicle at the time of accident and this fact was proved from Ex.P.8 Xerox copy driving license. The 2nd Respondent contended the deceased Insured his two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-23-BB-4403 and the policy covering the owner cum driver and the deceased also get compensation from their Insurance and again filed this claim application for trying to get double compensation. It is argued that if any award passed, it will be double claim, which is not permissible under M.V. Act. The petitioner counsel argued the deceased was not the owner of the two wheeler involved in the accident no claim was made with its Insurance company. The Ex.P11 is the M.V.I. report for the two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-23-BB-4403 and it proved the deceased was not owner, the claimant is the owner of the said two wheeler. It is not proved that the deceased has driving license to ride two wheeler. Hence, it is not possible for the claimant to claim compensation from the Insurance company. There was no positive to presume the claimant has already get compensation for the two wheeler Insurance company. Therefore, it is decided there was no double claim and the Respondents are liable to pay compensation to the claimants. HELMET 13. The 2nd Respondent counsel argued the deceased not wear the helmet at the time of accident and hence there was violation of MV. Rules by the deceased and hence the claimant not entitled for compensation. In Ex.P. 2 postmortem certificate it is mentioned there was diffuse sub-scalpal contusion entire scalp and it proved the deceased sustained head injury and it leads to death. The P.W.1 also admitted that her husband was died due to head injury. If the deceased wear helmet, the death could have avoided and there is every chance to save the life of the deceased and it proved there was clear negligence on the part of deceased. It is not proper to decline the compensation to the claimants. Considering the deceased not wear the helmet, it is decided the claimants has to bear 25% of compensation. 6 AGE 14. The claimants not produced the birth certificate of the deceased to prove the correct age. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 70 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report the approximate age of the deceased was recorded as 70 years. Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximate age of deceased recorded in Ex.P2 Postmortem Certificate treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 70 years at the time of accident. INCOME 15. The petitioners claimed Rs.20,00,000/- as compensation. The P.W.1 deposed the deceased was retired school teacher and get pension of Rs.18,209/- per month. The Ex.P6 is the SBI saving pass book and it proved last pension amount of deceased a sum of Rs. 18,209/- was credited into his account 1.9.2014. In Lal Dei v. Himachal Road Transport, reported in (2007) 8 SCC 319 , relying upon the decision reported in Helen C.Rebello v. Maharashtra S.R.T.C ., reported in (1999) 1 SCC 90 , it was held that the family pension is earned by an employee for the benefit of his family in the form of his contribution in terms of service conditions receivable by the heirs after his death and therefore, there is no correlation between these two and hence the family pension amount paid to the family cannot be deducted while calculating the compensation awarded to the claimants. Therefore, considering pension of Rs. 18,209/- received by the deceased, his income was arrived to Rs. 18,200/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 16. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546 , the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary, to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. The deceased was 70 years old and pensioner and hence the concept of future prospects not applicable for this case. Deductions: 17. The deceased was married person at the time of accident and there is only one claimant. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & 7 others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/3rd of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/3rd deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs. 18,200 – 6067 = 12,133/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF DEPENDENCY 18. Considering the age of the deceased is 70 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 5 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore t he “loss of dependency” to the family is arrived to Rs. 12,133x12x5=Rs.7,27,980/-. It is already decided the deceased not wear helmet at the time of accident and there by violated the M.V. rules and hence the claimant has to bear 25% off compensation. After deduction of 25% of compensation, the loss to the dependency is fixed to Rs. 727980 – 181995 = Rs. 5,45,985/-. COMPENSATION FOR CONSORTIUM AND LOVE AND AFFECTION CONSORTIUM 19. In Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2009 (2) TN MAC 36 (SC) and followed in Shashikala & another -Vs- Gangalakshmamana & another , 2015 (1) TN MAC 785 (SC) it has held that “Loss of consortium is usually for loss for spouse’s affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations for future years and in such circumstances, Courts to award at least Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation for Loss of Consortium” and this position followed in Reliance General Insurance Co Ltd -Vs-K.Meena & others, 2015 (2) TNMAC 449 . The 1st petitioner is wife and aged about 48 years at the time of the accident, which is the crucial period, at which time she very needed the companionship of her husband and for which Rs.1,00,000/- is awarded. Since considered the consortium, and there was only one dependency, no amount was awarded for love and affection. Funeral Expenses : 20. Decent burial is also one on the right under Art 21 of our constitution, The petitioner has failed to produce any expenditure statement relating to the funeral expenses, so the tribunal has awarded a minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- for the head, also relied the Judgment in Rajesh v. Rajbir singh [CDJ 2013 SC 485], the Hon’ble apex court has further held that “ Funeral expenses not only includes fee paid in crematorium or cementary but also includes religious practices and conventions performed on death in 8 family. Hence in absence of any evidence to contrary, minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- to be awarded by Courts towards funeral expenses ”. Hence, a sum of Rs,25,000/- alone was considered and fixed the award in lumpsum manner. Loss of Estate, Transport Expenses and damages for articles:- 21. This Tribunal not considered future prospects. Hence, t his Tribunal awarded Rs.25,000/- towards loss of estate. The petitioner not produced any documentary evidence showing the actual expenses for transport expenses. However, this Tribunal awarded Rs. 5000/- towards transport expenses. The petitioners not accounted for the actual damages caused in accident. Hence, this Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs. 2000/- towards damage to clothes and articles. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 5,45,985 2.Loss of consortium ...Rs. 1,00,000 3.Loss of Love & Affection …Rs. NIL 4.Loss of estate ...Rs . 25,000 5.Medical Expenses …Rs. NIL 6.Pain and Suffering …Rs. NIL 7.Funeral expenses ...Rs. 25,000 8.Transport expenses ...Rs. 5,000 9.Damages to cloths and articles ...Rs. 2,000 ------------------------ Total ...

Prior to the accident, the petitioner in MCOP No. 927/2014 was hale and healthy and working as a mason and earned Rs. 15,000/- per month and after the accident, he could not earn for his livelihood and he is the only bread 3 winner of his entire family. Hence, the petitioner in MCOP No. 927/2014 filed petition claiming compensation of Rs. 50,00,000/- lakhs for the injuries sustained by him in the accident and the petitioners in MCOP No. 184/2015 filed petition claiming compensation of Rs. 75,00,000/- for the death of Viswanathan in the accident. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 1st RESPONDENT IN BOTH THE PETITONS :- The age, income, occupation of the deceased persons as well as the injured persons are denied. The place, date, time and manner of the accident are not admitted. The accident was happened purely due to the rash and negligent riding of the deceased and not and not due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 2nd respondent. The Van bearing Reg.No. TN-03-A-6655 was insured with the 2nd respondent at the time of accident and the insurance policy was in force and hence the 2nd respondent is liable to pay compensation to the claimants. 4. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 2nd RESPONDENT IN BOTH THE PETITONS :- The petition is not sustainable either in law or on facts. This respondent denied all the allegations made in the petition except those that are specifically admitted. The manner of the accident not admitted. The driver of the 1st respondent drove the alleged vehicle in a slow and careful manner and the deceased ride the two wheeler in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the van. The petition is bad for non joinder of necessary parties and mis joinder of unnecessary parties. The age, income, occupation of the deceased as well as the injured persons are denied. The valid DL, RC. IC and FC of the alleged vehicle have also been denied. The relationship of the petitioners with the deceased and claiming of compensation are not admitted. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. 5. The Points : 1.Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent ? 2.Whether the petitioners in MCOP 927/2014 are entitled for compensation? if so, how much? 3.Whether the petitioner in MCOP 184/2015 is entitled for compensation? if so, how much? 4 6. The 2nd petitioner in M.C.O.P. No.184/2015 and the petitioner in MCOP No.927/2014 were examined as PW1 and P.W.2 respectively. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P.13 were marked on the side of the Petitioners. Mr. Arul Vinayagam examined as RW1 on the side of the 2nd respondent and Ex.R1 and R2 marked on their side. The 2nd respondent has filed petitions in IA No. /2017 in MCOP 184/2015 and IA No. /2017 in MCOP 927/2014 u/s 170 M.V. Act and both the petitions was allowed on 26.10.2017. POINT NO.1 7. The admitted facts are the 1st respondent is the owner-cum-driver of the vehicle bearing Reg.No. TN-03-A-6655 involved in a road accident happened on 19.10.2014. According to the petitioners that on 19.10.2014 at 18.45 Hours, while the deceased Viswanathan was proceeding to Sathuvachari in a Two Wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-23- AM-0540 from South to East, along with a pillion rider namely Prabhu who is the petitioner in MCOP No. 927/2014, opposite to Madan Agencies, Jamadi 5th road, Sathuvachari, a Mahindra Van bearing Reg.No. TN-03-A-6655, driven by the 1st respondent in a rash and negligent manner and hit the deceased vehicle and as a result the deceased in MCOP No. 184/2015 sustained fatal injuries and the petitioner in MCOP 927/2014 sustained fracture injuries on his left hand. Immediately the injured persons were admitted in Nalam Hospital, Sathuvachari where the deceased Viswanathan brought dead and the petitioner in MCOP No. 927/2014 admitted at ICU ward. 8. The accident was reported before Sathuvachari Police and they have registered a case in Crime No. 378/2014 u/s. 279, 337 and 304(A) IPC as against the driver of the vehicle bearing Reg.No. TN-03-A-6655 and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and wherein it was stated the 1st Respondent drove the van in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased vehicle and caused the accident. The P.W.1 deposed the same facts as stated in the petition. The PW1 has not seen the accident directly. Hence, the PW1 evidence is not sufficient to prove the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent. The P.W.2 examined as occurrence witness as well as injured witness and he deposed that the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of the van driver. The PW2 denied the suggestion that the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of the deceased. The 2nd Respondent counsel argued that the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of the deceased and he himself hit the alleged vehicle and caused the accident. To prove his contention RW1 was 5 examined on their side. RW1 deposed that the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent riding of the deceased. The investigation report is marked as Ex.R1 and Rough sketch is marked as Ex.R2. But in the cross examination, RW1 fairly admitted that the police have filed charge sheet against the 1st respondent and also the 1st respondent admitted his guilt and paid fine. The careful perusal of P.W.1 and 2 and RW1 evidences and Ex.P1 FIR, it is proved the accident was occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st respondent. Hence, it is decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent. Accordingly, this point is answered. POINT NO.2 :- (MCOP NO. 927/2014) 9. The petitioner Prabhu has sustained injuries in the accident and immediately taken to Nalam Hospital, Vellore then shifted to CMC Hospital, Vellore and again shifted to BABA Hospital, Vellore and taken treatment as an inpatient from 23.10.2014 to 28.10.2014 and this fact proved from the Ex.P10 and P11 Discharge summaries . The Ex.P10 is the discharge summary, issued by CMC Hospital, Vellore and it shows the petitioner had been treated for mild head injury and left humerus fracture. The petitioner after taking initial treatment at CMC had moved to BABA Hospital, Vellore for further treatment. Ex.P11 is the discharge summary issued by BABA hospital reveals that he had been admitted for treatment as an inpatient from 23.10.2014 to 28.10.2014 and he had undergone surgery with ORIF with BDCP under supraclavicular block in right lateral, position approach 15 cm incision fracture exposed reduced and fixed with 8 hole NDCP with 3+4 x 4.5 cm cotical screws. 10. It is stated due to accident he was not able to do work as before. The Disability certificate issued for the petitioner by the Medical Board is marked by consent as Ex.P13. For the fracture injury the Board had fixed 35% permanent disability. Since, the disability certificate is issued by the Medical Board, the percentage is accepted. Therefore, it is decided the petitioner sustained 35% permanent disability. 11. For loss of earning capacity the learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that multiplier method should be considered. He would submit the reported decision in 2017(2) TN MAC 293, Metropolitan Transport Corporation Vs. Sundara Vadivel .. . wherein in Loss of earning capacity - assessment method - whether percentage of disability 6 method as adopted by Tribunal in case of 54 % disability and apprehension of inconsistencies in assessment of disability - direction issued by Division bench - discussed. But the above ruling is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case. Since the injured is 20 years old at the time of accident, mason, earning Rs. 15,000/- per month, but no documents filed to prove his age, avocation and income. Therefore, considering the nature of injury, period of treatment, this Tribunal not adopting the multiplier method. Hence, this Tribunal inclined to award Rs.3000/- per percentage (derived from 2013 (2) TNMAC 583, In the High Court of Madras, National Insurance Co., Ltd., Vs. G.Ramesh and P.Yoshuva's case) and a sum of Rs.1,05,000/- is allowed under the head of partial permanent disability. In absence of income proof, the income of the petitioner is fixed at Rs.9,000/- per month. On considering the medical evidence with oral evidence of PW2, it reveals that the petitioner is not return to his previous work fully after the accident at least for 3 months. Hence, this Tribunal has calculated the loss of income in lumpsum basis viz., 9000/- x 3 = Rs.27,000/-. 12. The petitioner claimed Rs.10,00,000/- towards pain and sufferings. Considering the petitioner sustained fracture injury, duration of treatment and underwent surgery, Rs. 25,000/- is granted towards pain and sufferings. The petitioner claimed Rs.1,00,000/- towards medical expenses. The Ex.P12 is the medical bills and it proved the petitioner has spent Rs.55,891.29 towards medical treatment. Therefore, this Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs.56,000/- towards medical expenses. The petitioner claimed Rs.50,000/- towards transport to hospital, but no document produced. However, considering the nature of injuries and the petitioner has taken treatment in three different hospitals, Rs. 25,000/- is awarded towards transport to hospital. The petitioner claimed Rs.50,000/- towards Extra nourishment, but no proof has been filed. However, considering the nature of injuries and surgery undergone by him, Rs. 25,000/- is granted for extra nourishment. The petitioner claimed Rs.50,000/- towards damages to clothing and articles, but not produced any documents. However, Rs.5,000/- is granted towards damages to clothing and articles. Apart from this, this Tribunal granted Rs. 25,000/- towards loss of amenities. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 7 1.Loss of Permanent Disability ...Rs. 1,05,000/- 2.Loss of income for 3 months ...Rs. 27,000/- 3.Medical bills ...Rs. 56,000/- 4.Pain and suffering ...Rs. 25,000/- 5.Transport Expenses ...Rs. 25,000/- 6.Extra nourishment ...Rs. 25,000/- 7.Loss of amenities ...Rs. 25,000/- 8.Damages to clothing and articles ... Rs. 5,000/- ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 2,93,000/- ------------------------- 13. The 1st respondent had duly insured his vehicle with the 2nd respondent. There is no plea for policy violation. The 1st respondent was having valid DL at the time of accident and this fact was proved from the Ex.P5 Driving license of the 1st respondent. Earlier, I have held that the accident had occurred due to the negligent act of the 1st respondent. So, as insurer of the 1st respondent's vehicle, the 2nd respondent is liable to pay the above compensation amount to the petitioner. POINT NO.3 :- (MCOP NO. 184/2015) 14. According to the petitioners, the 1st and 2nd petitioners are parents and 3rd is the sister of the deceased Viswanathan. The Ex.P7 is the Legal heirship certificate. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased Viswanathan and wherein noted the following External Injuries:- 1. Multiple grazed abrasions of varying sizes noted on the left arm and face. 2. Fracture deformity of the mandible. 3. 5 cm x 4 cm contused swelling on the right parietal region. The doctor has also noted the following internal injuries: 1. Subscalpal contusion on the fronto parietal region. 2. There is a linear fracture from the vault of the skull to the right parietal region. 3. There is marked subdural and subarachnoid hemorrage both cerebral hemispheres. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries sustained. 15. It is already decided the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the 8 deceased Viswanathan was died only due to the injuries sustained in the accident. The 1st Respondent validly insured the vehicle with the 2nd Respondent and this fact was proved by Ex.P3 insurance policy certificate and hence the 2nd Respondent is liable to pay compensation to the claimants on behalf of the 1st respondent. HELMET 16. The 2nd Respondent counsel argued the deceased not wear the helmet at the time of accident and hence there was violation of MV. Rules by the deceased and hence the claimants not entitled for compensation. The Doctor opined in Ex.P.2 postmortem certificate that the death was due to multiple injuries. The P.W.1 also admitted the deceased was died due to head injury. If the deceased wear helmet, the death could have been avoided and there is every chance to save the life of the deceased. The 2nd Respondent not pleaded in counter about the non wearing of helmet by the deceased. It is settled position of law, no amount of evidence can be considered without pleadings. Hence, it is decided without raising the issue of non wearing helmet in counter, the 2nd Respondent not entitled to address in argument. Therefore, it is decided there was no negligence on the part of deceased. AGE 17. This Tribunal accepted the date of birth of deceased mentioned in Ex.P.6, P8 and P9 as correct date of birth of deceased and the age of deceased was decided to 19 years, 5 months, 12 days at the time of accident and he crossed the age of 19 and hence the age of deceased is fixed as 20 years at the time of accident. INCOME 18. The petitioners claimed Rs.75,00,000/- as compensation for the death of their son. The deceased was a student at the time of accident and non earning member. The P.W.1 also admitted the deceased was non earning member at the time of accident and depending upon them. The Ex.P.8 and P.9 are the education certificates of the deceased. The deceased studying B.C.A. Third year student at the time of accident. The perusal of education certificates, it is proved the deceased completed five semesters and the accident was occurred during his six semester study. The counsel for the petitioner argued that the notional income of the deceased to be taken into Rs.9000/- per month and in support of his argument he relied on the ruling IFFCO-TOKIO, General Insurance 9 Co.Ltd Vs K.Elammal; (2015-2 TN MAC 42 , wherein the notional income of student in different categories discussed at para 7 as follows:- 7. Though Mr.C.R.Krishnamoorthy, learned counsel appearing for the appellant would submit that the deceased was a non earning member and if at all, only Rs.30,000/- can be taken as notional income as per the judgment in Kishan Gopal & another vs. Lala & others reported in 2013 (2) TN MAC 358 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in Ashvinbhai Jayantilal Modi Vs. Ramkaran Ramchandra Sharma and another reported in 2014 ACJ 2648 in respect of a first year Medical College student, who died in an accident, determined the monthly income at Rs.25,000/-. Similarly, this Court, in United India Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Velumyil and others reported in 2013 (2) TN MAC 846, in respect of a first year B.E. student, who died in an accident, determined Rs.15,000/- as monthly income. In this case, the deceased was a II year B.Com student. Though, he cannot be equated to a Medical College student or an Engineering College student, at least Rs.6,000/- per month should be taken as monthly income and adding 50% towards future prospects, as per the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Santosh Devi's case reported in (2012) 6 SCC 421, the total monthly income would be, = Rs.6000/- + 50% (Rs.6000/-) = Rs. 9000/-. In the above cited ruling notional income for B.Com., studying student was arrived to Rs. 6,000/-. Considering wide job opportunity, equal to the Engineering student, it is the view of this Tribunal, it would be justifiable in fixing the notional income of final year studying BCA student is Rs.9000/-. As per the above ruling 50% future prospects added and the notional monthly income of deceased was arrived to Rs. 13,500/-. Deductions: 19. The deceased was bachelor person at the time of accident. There are 3 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted ½ of income towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After ½ deduction the contribution to the parents fixed as Rs.6,750/- per month. Considering the deceased was 20 years at the time of accident, the proper multiplier is 18. Hence loss of dependency is calculated to Rs. 6750x12x18 = 14,58,000/- 10 20. The petitioners have claimed Rs. 9,00,000/- towards loss of love and affection. The petitioners are the parents and sister of the deceased and certainly there will be a loss to them on the death of the deceased and hence Rs.1,00,000 /- is awarded towards love and affection. For funeral expenses, the petitioners have claimed Rs.50,000/-, but not produced any document. However, a sum of Rs.25,000/- is granted towards funeral expenses. The petitioners claimed Rs. 50,000/- towards transport expenses, but not produced any document. However, this Tribunal awarded Rs. 25,000/- towards transport expenses. The petitioners have claimed Rs.50,000/- towards damages to clothing and articles, but not produced any document. However, Rs.5,000/- is granted towards damages to clothing and articles. The petitioners have claimed Rs.5,50,000/- towards mental shock and agony, Rs.3,00,000/- towards loss of estate and Rs.6,00,000/- towards loss of expectation of life. Since this Tribunal considered future prospects, not awarded any amount under the above heads. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 14,58,000/- 2.Loss of Love & Affection …Rs. 1,00,000/- 3.Funeral expenses ...Rs. 25,000/- 4.Transport expenses ...Rs. 25,000/- 5.Damages to clothing and articles ... Rs. 5,000/- ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 16,13,000/- ------------------------- MCOP NO. 927/2014 21.

According to the petitioners that on 19.10.2014 at 18.45 Hours, while the deceased Viswanathan was proceeding to Sathuvachari in a Two Wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-23- AM-0540 from South to East, along with a pillion rider namely Prabhu who is the petitioner in MCOP No. 927/2014, opposite to Madan Agencies, Jamadi 5th road, Sathuvachari, a Mahindra Van bearing Reg.No. TN-03-A-6655, driven by the 1st respondent in a rash and negligent manner and hit the deceased vehicle and as a result the deceased in MCOP No. 184/2015 sustained fatal injuries and the petitioner in MCOP 927/2014 sustained fracture injuries on his left hand. Immediately the injured persons were admitted in Nalam Hospital, Sathuvachari where the deceased Viswanathan brought dead and the petitioner in MCOP No. 927/2014 admitted at ICU ward. 8. The accident was reported before Sathuvachari Police and they have registered a case in Crime No. 378/2014 u/s. 279, 337 and 304(A) IPC as against the driver of the vehicle bearing Reg.No. TN-03-A-6655 and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and wherein it was stated the 1st Respondent drove the van in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased vehicle and caused the accident. The P.W.1 deposed the same facts as stated in the petition. The PW1 has not seen the accident directly. Hence, the PW1 evidence is not sufficient to prove the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent. The P.W.2 examined as occurrence witness as well as injured witness and he deposed that the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of the van driver. The PW2 denied the suggestion that the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of the deceased. The 2nd Respondent counsel argued that the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of the deceased and he himself hit the alleged vehicle and caused the accident. To prove his contention RW1 was 5 examined on their side. RW1 deposed that the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent riding of the deceased. The investigation report is marked as Ex.R1 and Rough sketch is marked as Ex.R2. But in the cross examination, RW1 fairly admitted that the police have filed charge sheet against the 1st respondent and also the 1st respondent admitted his guilt and paid fine. The careful perusal of P.W.1 and 2 and RW1 evidences and Ex.P1 FIR, it is proved the accident was occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st respondent. Hence, it is decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent. Accordingly, this point is answered. POINT NO.2 :- (MCOP NO. 927/2014) 9. The petitioner Prabhu has sustained injuries in the accident and immediately taken to Nalam Hospital, Vellore then shifted to CMC Hospital, Vellore and again shifted to BABA Hospital, Vellore and taken treatment as an inpatient from 23.10.2014 to 28.10.2014 and this fact proved from the Ex.P10 and P11 Discharge summaries . The Ex.P10 is the discharge summary, issued by CMC Hospital, Vellore and it shows the petitioner had been treated for mild head injury and left humerus fracture. The petitioner after taking initial treatment at CMC had moved to BABA Hospital, Vellore for further treatment. Ex.P11 is the discharge summary issued by BABA hospital reveals that he had been admitted for treatment as an inpatient from 23.10.2014 to 28.10.2014 and he had undergone surgery with ORIF with BDCP under supraclavicular block in right lateral, position approach 15 cm incision fracture exposed reduced and fixed with 8 hole NDCP with 3+4 x 4.5 cm cotical screws. 10. It is stated due to accident he was not able to do work as before. The Disability certificate issued for the petitioner by the Medical Board is marked by consent as Ex.P13. For the fracture injury the Board had fixed 35% permanent disability. Since, the disability certificate is issued by the Medical Board, the percentage is accepted. Therefore, it is decided the petitioner sustained 35% permanent disability. 11. For loss of earning capacity the learned counsel for the petitioner would submit that multiplier method should be considered. He would submit the reported decision in 2017(2) TN MAC 293, Metropolitan Transport Corporation Vs. Sundara Vadivel .. . wherein in Loss of earning capacity - assessment method - whether percentage of disability 6 method as adopted by Tribunal in case of 54 % disability and apprehension of inconsistencies in assessment of disability - direction issued by Division bench - discussed. But the above ruling is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case. Since the injured is 20 years old at the time of accident, mason, earning Rs. 15,000/- per month, but no documents filed to prove his age, avocation and income. Therefore, considering the nature of injury, period of treatment, this Tribunal not adopting the multiplier method. Hence, this Tribunal inclined to award Rs.3000/- per percentage (derived from 2013 (2) TNMAC 583, In the High Court of Madras, National Insurance Co., Ltd., Vs. G.Ramesh and P.Yoshuva's case) and a sum of Rs.1,05,000/- is allowed under the head of partial permanent disability. In absence of income proof, the income of the petitioner is fixed at Rs.9,000/- per month. On considering the medical evidence with oral evidence of PW2, it reveals that the petitioner is not return to his previous work fully after the accident at least for 3 months. Hence, this Tribunal has calculated the loss of income in lumpsum basis viz., 9000/- x 3 = Rs.27,000/-. 12. The petitioner claimed Rs.10,00,000/- towards pain and sufferings. Considering the petitioner sustained fracture injury, duration of treatment and underwent surgery, Rs. 25,000/- is granted towards pain and sufferings. The petitioner claimed Rs.1,00,000/- towards medical expenses. The Ex.P12 is the medical bills and it proved the petitioner has spent Rs.55,891.29 towards medical treatment. Therefore, this Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs.56,000/- towards medical expenses. The petitioner claimed Rs.50,000/- towards transport to hospital, but no document produced. However, considering the nature of injuries and the petitioner has taken treatment in three different hospitals, Rs. 25,000/- is awarded towards transport to hospital. The petitioner claimed Rs.50,000/- towards Extra nourishment, but no proof has been filed. However, considering the nature of injuries and surgery undergone by him, Rs. 25,000/- is granted for extra nourishment. The petitioner claimed Rs.50,000/- towards damages to clothing and articles, but not produced any documents. However, Rs.5,000/- is granted towards damages to clothing and articles. Apart from this, this Tribunal granted Rs. 25,000/- towards loss of amenities. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 7 1.Loss of Permanent Disability ...Rs. 1,05,000/- 2.Loss of income for 3 months ...Rs. 27,000/- 3.Medical bills ...Rs. 56,000/- 4.Pain and suffering ...Rs. 25,000/- 5.Transport Expenses ...Rs. 25,000/- 6.Extra nourishment ...Rs. 25,000/- 7.Loss of amenities ...Rs. 25,000/- 8.Damages to clothing and articles ... Rs. 5,000/- ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 2,93,000/- ------------------------- 13. The 1st respondent had duly insured his vehicle with the 2nd respondent. There is no plea for policy violation. The 1st respondent was having valid DL at the time of accident and this fact was proved from the Ex.P5 Driving license of the 1st respondent. Earlier, I have held that the accident had occurred due to the negligent act of the 1st respondent. So, as insurer of the 1st respondent's vehicle, the 2nd respondent is liable to pay the above compensation amount to the petitioner. POINT NO.3 :- (MCOP NO. 184/2015) 14. According to the petitioners, the 1st and 2nd petitioners are parents and 3rd is the sister of the deceased Viswanathan. The Ex.P7 is the Legal heirship certificate. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased Viswanathan and wherein noted the following External Injuries:- 1. Multiple grazed abrasions of varying sizes noted on the left arm and face. 2. Fracture deformity of the mandible. 3. 5 cm x 4 cm contused swelling on the right parietal region.

There is a linear fracture from the vault of the skull to the right parietal region. 3. There is marked subdural and subarachnoid hemorrage both cerebral hemispheres. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries sustained. 15. It is already decided the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the 8 deceased Viswanathan was died only due to the injuries sustained in the accident. The 1st Respondent validly insured the vehicle with the 2nd Respondent and this fact was proved by Ex.P3 insurance policy certificate and hence the 2nd Respondent is liable to pay compensation to the claimants on behalf of the 1st respondent. HELMET 16. The 2nd Respondent counsel argued the deceased not wear the helmet at the time of accident and hence there was violation of MV. Rules by the deceased and hence the claimants not entitled for compensation. The Doctor opined in Ex.P.2 postmortem certificate that the death was due to multiple injuries. The P.W.1 also admitted the deceased was died due to head injury. If the deceased wear helmet, the death could have been avoided and there is every chance to save the life of the deceased. The 2nd Respondent not pleaded in counter about the non wearing of helmet by the deceased. It is settled position of law, no amount of evidence can be considered without pleadings. Hence, it is decided without raising the issue of non wearing helmet in counter, the 2nd Respondent not entitled to address in argument. Therefore, it is decided there was no negligence on the part of deceased. AGE 17. This Tribunal accepted the date of birth of deceased mentioned in Ex.P.6, P8 and P9 as correct date of birth of deceased and the age of deceased was decided to 19 years, 5 months, 12 days at the time of accident and he crossed the age of 19 and hence the age of deceased is fixed as 20 years at the time of accident. INCOME 18. The petitioners claimed Rs.75,00,000/- as compensation for the death of their son. The deceased was a student at the time of accident and non earning member. The P.W.1 also admitted the deceased was non earning member at the time of accident and depending upon them. The Ex.P.8 and P.9 are the education certificates of the deceased. The deceased studying B.C.A. Third year student at the time of accident. The perusal of education certificates, it is proved the deceased completed five semesters and the accident was occurred during his six semester study. The counsel for the petitioner argued that the notional income of the deceased to be taken into Rs.9000/- per month and in support of his argument he relied on the ruling IFFCO-TOKIO, General Insurance 9 Co.Ltd Vs K.Elammal; (2015-2 TN MAC 42 , wherein the notional income of student in different categories discussed at para 7 as follows:- 7. Though Mr.C.R.Krishnamoorthy, learned counsel appearing for the appellant would submit that the deceased was a non earning member and if at all, only Rs.30,000/- can be taken as notional income as per the judgment in Kishan Gopal & another vs. Lala & others reported in 2013 (2) TN MAC 358 (SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court, in Ashvinbhai Jayantilal Modi Vs. Ramkaran Ramchandra Sharma and another reported in 2014 ACJ 2648 in respect of a first year Medical College student, who died in an accident, determined the monthly income at Rs.25,000/-. Similarly, this Court, in United India Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Velumyil and others reported in 2013 (2) TN MAC 846, in respect of a first year B.E. student, who died in an accident, determined Rs.15,000/- as monthly income. In this case, the deceased was a II year B.Com student. Though, he cannot be equated to a Medical College student or an Engineering College student, at least Rs.6,000/- per month should be taken as monthly income and adding 50% towards future prospects, as per the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Santosh Devi's case reported in (2012) 6 SCC 421, the total monthly income would be, = Rs.6000/- + 50% (Rs.6000/-) = Rs. 9000/-. In the above cited ruling notional income for B.Com., studying student was arrived to Rs. 6,000/-. Considering wide job opportunity, equal to the Engineering student, it is the view of this Tribunal, it would be justifiable in fixing the notional income of final year studying BCA student is Rs.9000/-. As per the above ruling 50% future prospects added and the notional monthly income of deceased was arrived to Rs. 13,500/-. Deductions: 19. The deceased was bachelor person at the time of accident. There are 3 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted ½ of income towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After ½ deduction the contribution to the parents fixed as Rs.6,750/- per month. Considering the deceased was 20 years at the time of accident, the proper multiplier is 18. Hence loss of dependency is calculated to Rs. 6750x12x18 = 14,58,000/- 10 20. The petitioners have claimed Rs. 9,00,000/- towards loss of love and affection. The petitioners are the parents and sister of the deceased and certainly there will be a loss to them on the death of the deceased and hence Rs.1,00,000 /- is awarded towards love and affection. For funeral expenses, the petitioners have claimed Rs.50,000/-, but not produced any document. However, a sum of Rs.25,000/- is granted towards funeral expenses. The petitioners claimed Rs. 50,000/- towards transport expenses, but not produced any document. However, this Tribunal awarded Rs. 25,000/- towards transport expenses.

Since this Tribunal considered future prospects, not awarded any amount under the above heads. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 14,58,000/- 2.Loss of Love & Affection …Rs. 1,00,000/- 3.Funeral expenses ...Rs. 25,000/- 4.Transport expenses ...Rs. 25,000/- 5.Damages to clothing and articles ...

This petition, coming up for final hearing before me, on 1.12.2016, in the presence of Thiru. N. Sankar, Advocate for the Petitioners and Tmt. M. Shamshath Hassini Begam, counsel for the 2nd respondent and Thiru. D. Mohanarangam, counsel appeared for 1st Respondent and remained absent and set exparte and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court doth delivereth the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 3. Name of deceased Person : Margabandhu 4. Age of the person dead : 69 years 5. Occupation : Tractor Owner/ Pensioner 6. Income pleaded : Rs.30,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 10.12.2014 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.30,00,000/- 2 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the wife, sons and daughters of the deceased Margabandhu who died in a road accident. That on 10.12.2014 at about 8.00 A.M, after attending marriage at Kumaran Marriage Hall at Alamalumangapuram, Vellore, he went to TNSTC regional office by walk from South to North side, opposite to TNSTC Regional office in NH road to catch bus to go to his village Chenganavaram. At that time the TVS Apache two wheeler bearing Regn.No. TN-73-Y- 7684, owned by the 1st respondent was driven by one Mohamed Rayon, in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and as a result of the accident, the deceased sustained grievous injury on all over the body and immediately he was taken to Government Hospital at Vellore and subsequently died. The accident was reported to Sathuvachari Police and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 475/2014, u/s. 279, 338 of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and the claimants are depending upon the income of the deceased and due to the sudden demise the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners has filed this petition claiming Rs.30,00,000/- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 2nd RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. The rider of the two wheeler was in slow and careful manner following all traffic rules, but the accident was occurred only due sudden cross of the road by the deceased. The deceased also contributed negligence to the accident. The rider of the two wheeler has no valid driving license to drive the vehicle involved in the accident and it was violation of terms of Insurance policy and hence this Respondent is not liable to pay the compensation amount. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 4th petitioner examined as PW1 and one Sakthivel examined as PW2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P.14 marked on the side of the Petitioners. No oral and documentary evidence for the 2nd Respondent. 3 POINT NO.1 6. It is admitted fact the 1st Respondent is the owner of the TVS Apache two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-73-Y-7684 which involved in the accident and Mr. H. Mohamed Rayan was rode the two wheeler at the time of accident. The petitioner contended the rider of the two wheeler rode it in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. But, the 2nd Respondent contended that the rider of the two wheeler was in a slow and careful manner and the accident was happened due to the sudden cross of the deceased. The offending vehicle was inspected by the MVI and issued the Ex.P.4, M.V.I. report stating the tyre condition was satisfactory and the Breaking system was in order and there was no mechanical defect in the offending vehicle. Since, the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident pleaded by the claimants and there was no mechanical defect in the offending vehicle, we have to decide whether the rider of two wheeler is responsible for the accident and there was any contributory negligence on the part of deceased. 7. The P.W.1 deposed that on 10.12.2014 at about 8.00 A.M, after attending marriage at Kumaran Marriage Hall at Alamalumangapuram, Vellore, he went to TNSTC regional office by walk from South to North side, opposite to TNSTC Regional office in NH road to catch bus to go to his village Chenganavaram, at that time the rider of Apache two wheeler bearing Regn.No. TN-73-Y-7684, owned by the 1st respondent ridden the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and as a result of the accident, the deceased sustained grievous injury on all over the body and immediately he was taken to Government Hospital at Vellore and subsequently died. The P.W.1 not seen the accident directly and hence the P.W. 1 evidence is not sufficient to prove the manner of accident. 8. The P.W. 2 examined as occurrence witness and he deposed that on 10.12.2014 at about 8.00 A.M, when he was taking morning tiffin at road side hotel, near to TNSTC Regional office, Vellore, while the deceased was walking to catch the bus, the rider of 1st Respondent's two wheeler rode the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and due to accident the deceased sustained injuries on all over the body. 9. The Sathuvachari police recorded the statement of the deceased while he was in treatment at Government Hospital , Vellore, and registered the case in Cr.No.475/2014 4 for offence u/s 279, 338 IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and wherein also it was stated the rider of the two wheeler rode it in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. After investigation the police has filed the charge sheet against the rider of the two wheeler and this fact proved through the Ex.P. 2 copy of charge sheet. 10. The 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident. The 2nd Respondent has not put the rider of the two wheeler into the witness box to state as to how accident occurred and to depose that he was not at fault and was not driving the vehicle in rash and negligent manner. The 2nd Respondent contended the deceased also contributed negligence to the accident. The contributory negligence is a sharing of responsibility for damage where a person suffers damage as a result partly of his own fault and partly of the fault of any other person. The P.W. 2 admitted in cross examination that the accident was happened wh ile the deceased crossed the NH road. The NH road has sufficient space for parallel running of two heavy goods vehicles. Even though the deceased crossed the road, considering there was sufficient space in NH road, the accident may be avoided if the rider of two wheeler takes little care and caution and applied driving skill. Therefore, it is decided the deceased not contributed negligence to the accident. It is proved from the P.W.2 evidence the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent riding of rider of the two wheeler. Hence it is decided the accident was occurred only due to rash and negligent riding of the rider of the two wheeler. Point No.2: 11. The 1st petitioner is the wife of the deceased. The petitioners 2 to 7 are sons and daughters of deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.14 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.3 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein the Doctor noted the following External and internal Injuries:- 1. Multiple abrasions over left side chest, abdomen, right knee and left shoulder. 2. Both bone fracture left leg present (Tibia and Fibula) 3. On dissection of scalp, skull and dura: Diffuse sub-scalpal contusions on the right temporal region. 4. Fracture of vault of skull: parietal as well as temporal bone on the right side. 5. Marked subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhage noted over both cerebral hemispheres. 6. Base of skull: Fracture of anterior and middle cranial fossa on the right side. 7. On dissection of the chest and abdomen: Laprotomy scar present. Fractured both sides 5 of 2 to 8 ribs of the chest and multiple puncture over anterior surface of the lungs. 8. Liver and spleen ruptured. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died of Multiple Injuries. 12. It is already decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent riding of rider of the two wheeler belonged to 1st Respondent. The Ex.P3 postmortem report proved the deceased was succumbed to death only due to the multiple injuries sustained in accident. The first Respondent insured the vehicle with the 2nd Respondent and the insurance was in force on the date of accident and this fact was proved through Ex.P.7 copy of Insurance policy certificate. The rider of the two wheeler also has valid driving license to drive the offending vehicle at the time of accident and this fact was proved from Ex.P.9 copy of driving license of rider Mohamed Rayon. Hence, the Respondents are liable to pay compensation to the claimants. AGE 13. The Ex.P.10 is copy of first page of SSLC Book and wherein the date of birth of deceased was recorded as 7.10.1945 and it is proved the deceased crossed the age of 69 and age 70 was running at the time of accident. Hence, the age of the deceased was fixed as 70 years at the time of accident. REIMBURSEMENT OF MEDICAL EXPENSES:- 14. After the accident the deceased was admitted at Government Hospital, Vellore and this fact was proved through the Ex.P. 6 wound certificate. Then the injured was shifted to CMC Hospital, Vellore for treatment and in spite of treatment he died on the same day and this fact was proved from the Ex.P. 5 death summary issued from CMC Hospital, Vellore. The Ex.P.13 is the consolidated statement of medical expenses and it proved the claimants spent Rs.32,115/- towards medical expenditure. The 2nd Respondent is liable to reimburse the same to the claimants. INCOME 15. The petitioners claimed Rs.30,00,000/- as compensation. The P.W.1 deposed that the deceased was retired TNSTC conductor and after retirement doing Agriculture work and earned Rs. 30,000/- per month. The P.W.1 further deposed that the deceased was owner of Tractor and earned Rs. 10,000/- from operation of Tractor. The claimants not 6 proved the deceased was retired TNSTC conductor and pensioner.

Book for Tractor bearing Reg.No. TN-73-C-8645 and it stands in the name of deceased. The perusal of Ex.P.11 and P.12 proved the deceased was Agriculturist. There will be much loss of income from the lands, it will be cultivated by the sons of the deceased. It is proved the deceased earned some income from operating Tractor. Considering the deceased was owner of Tractor and necessity of Tractor for modern Agriculture, it is decided the deceased earned Rs. 9,000/- per month through tractor operation. Considering the deceased was self Agriculturist and operating of tractor for rent, this court decided the deceased earned Rs. 15,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 16. The age of deceased was 70 years at the time of accident. Hence not entitled for future prospects. Deductions: 17. The deceased was family man at the time of accident. There are 7 claimants.

After 1/5th deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs. 15000 – 3000 = 12000/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF DEPENDENCY 18. Considering the age of the deceased was 70 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 5 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore the compensation calculated to Rs.12000x12x5=Rs.7,20,000/- and the “loss of dependency” to the family is arrived to Rs. 7,20,000/-.

Natarajan, B.Sc., B.L., I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Vellore. Monday, the 17th day of April, 2017. M.C.O.P.No. 436/2015 1. P. Kavitha 2. P. Silambarasan 3. P. Kaviyarasan 4. Unnamalai .. Petitioners. /Vs/ 1. E. Prabakaran `2. Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd., Rep. By its Divisional Manager, Vellore... Respondents. This petition, coming up for final hearing before me, on 28.3.2017, in the presence of Thiru. V. Padmanaban, Advocate for the Petitioners and Thiru. J. Chitti Babu, counsel for the 2nd respondent and the 1st Respondent remained absent and set exparte and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court doth delivereth the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 3. Name of deceased Person : V. Paneerselvam 4. Age of the person dead : 45 years 5. Occupation : Auto Owner cum Driver 6. Income pleaded : Rs.20,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 2.7.2014 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.45,00,000/- 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the wife, sons and mother of the deceased Paneerselvam who died in a road accident. That on 2.7.2014 at about 2.45 P.M, opposite to Government High School, Perumugai, while the deceased was driving his own Auto bearing Reg.No. TN-23-BB-7081, from south to 2 North at normal speed by following traffic rules, at that time the Maxi Cab van bearing Regn.No. TN-20-BL-0911, owned by the 1st respondent was driven by its driver Mr. Navasakthy Dev in a rash and negligent manner without following the traffic rules and regulation and without blowing horn from West to East direction in hurried manner and suddenly the van driver lost control and dashed against the rear side of Auto and due to strong hit the Auto was capsized and rolled two times and as a result of accident the deceased sustained head injury and multiple injuries on all over the body and immediately taken to Government Hospital at Vellore and died subsequently. The accident was reported to Sathuvachari P olice and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 205/2014, u/s. 279 & 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and working as Auto owner cum driver and earned Rs.20,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs. 45,00,000/- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 2nd RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. This Respondent denied the manner of accident. It is denied the death was caused due to the injuries. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. The relationship of the claimants with the deceased and right to claim compensation was denied. The deceased drove the Auto without F.C, Permit and Insurance and he had no valid driving license to drive Auto. The allegation that the 1st Respondent's driver drove the van in rash and negligent manner and caused the accident was denied. But the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent act of the deceased, who suddenly crossed the road without noticing the vehicles coming in the NH road. The deceased also contributed negligence to the accident. The 1st Respondent's driver has no valid driving licence to drive the offending vehicle and it was violation of terms of Insurance policy and hence this Respondent is not liable to pay the compensation amount. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 3 5. The 2nd petitioner examined as PW1 and Ex.P1 to Ex.P.8 marked on the side of the Petitioners. The 2nd Respondent examined Mr. Kumar, investigator as R.W.1 and through him Ex.R1 to R3 marked. POINT NO.1: 6. It is admitted fact the 1st Respondent is the owner of the Maxi Cab Van bearing Reg.No. TN-20-BL-0911 which involved in the accident and Mr.Navasakthy Dev was driving the offending vehicle at the time of accident. It is the case of petitioners that while the deceased drove the Auto bearing Reg.No. TN-23-BB-7081 in a slow and careful manner, the 1st Respondent's driver drove the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed on rear side of the Auto and thereby caused accident. But, the 2nd Respondent contended the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in slow and careful manner and the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the Auto by the deceased. The offending vehicle was inspected by the MVI, and issued the Ex.P.3, M.V.I. report stating the tyre condition was satisfactory and the Breaking system was in order and the accident was occurred not due to mechanical defect. The MVI report for the Auto driven by the deceased was attached with Ex.R.3 document and wherein also mentioned there was no mechanical defect in the vehicle. The damages noted in the M.V.I. reports proved the 1st Respondent's van and the Auto driven by the deceased were involved in the accident. In this case the accident was admitted, but the manner of accident alone disputed. The police investigated the crime and filed charge sheet against the 1st Respondent's driver and this fact was proved from Ex.P.4 copy of charge sheet. After trial, the 1st Respondent's driver was acquitted from the offence and the copy of judgment rendered by the learned Judicial Magistrate No.V, Vellore, in C.C.No. 523/2014. It is settled position of law, the judgments of the criminal courts are not relevant and admissible in the trial of civil cases or MCOP cases except to the extent of showing that there was a criminal prosecution and the same resulted in conviction or acquittal. Since, there was no mechanical defect in both the vehicles and the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident and also pleaded for contributed negligence, irrespective of whether criminal prosecution launched or not and its result, the claimants have to prove the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver independently before this Tribunal. So, we have to decide whether the claimants have proved the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver and the 2nd Respondent has proved the allegation of contributory negligence against the deceased. 4 7. It is also settled law that the term rashness and negligence has to be construed lightly while making a decision on a petition for claim for the same as compared to the word rashness and negligence as mention in the Indian Penal Code . This is because the chapter in the Motor Vehicle Act dealing with compensation is a benevolent legislation and not a penal one. Minding this legal principle we have to consider whether the claimants have proved the negligence of the 1st Respondent's driver. The P.W.1 deposed that on 2.7.2014 at about 2.45 P.M, opposite to Government High School, Perumugai, when he was talking with his friend Prabu, his father, the deceased was driving his own Auto bearing Reg.No. TN-23-BB-7081, from South to North, at normal speed by following traffic rules, at that time on the same direction, the Maxi Cab van bearing Regn.No. TN-20-BL- 0911 was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and without blowing horn and dashed against the Auto and the deceased was admitted at Government Hospital at Vellore and died subsequently. 8. At request of 2nd Respondent the R.W.1, the Investigator has investigated the accident and filed Ex.R.1 report stating there was no negligence on the part of 1st Respondent's driver and hence he was acquitted from charge and filed the copy of acquittal judgment as Ex.R. 2. The deposition recorded before Judicial Magistrate No. V, Vellore and other records pertained to accident marked as Ex.R.3. The R.W.1 also deposed in support of 2nd Respondent. The perusal of R.W.1 evidence revealed that he has not conducted fair investigation and he just perused the records available at police station and simply concluded there was no rash and negligen t driving on the part of 1st Respondent's driver. It is admitted fact the accident was occurred on Chennai to Bangalore NH road. The rough sketch in Ex.R.3 proved the road at accident spot runs on East to West direction. It was elicited from cross examination of P.W.1, that at the time of accident, the deceased drove the Auto from East to West direction and take “U” turn towards North direction and perusal of rough sketch also corroborated the P.W.1 evidence. It is also proved the deceased drove the Auto at South side track and the 1st Respondent's driver drove the van at North track from West to East direction and when the deceased take “U” turn towards north, the van was dashed against the Auto. These facts not stated in the Ex.R.1 report. 9. The 2nd Respondent contended the deceased also contributed negligence to the accident. The contributory negligence is a sharing of responsibility for damage where a person suffers damage as a result partly of his own fault and partly of the fault of any 5 other person. The 1st Respondent's driver was the best person to depose about the allegation of the contributory negligence. The petitioner counsel argued t he 2nd Respondent has not put the 1st Respondent's driver into the witness box to state as to how the accident occurred and to depose that he was not at fault and was not driving the vehicle in rash and negligent manner or the allegation of contributory negligence. It is not necessary to examine the 1st Respondent's driver to prove the allegation of contributory negligence. The P.W.1 evidence itself is enough to decide about the allegation of contributory negligence. The P.W.1 evidence proved the deceased take “U” turn towards North direction without noticing the vehicles coming on the Northern track. The deceased, being driver, before taking “U” turn, failed to take care to seen the vehicle coming at Northern side track. Therefore, this Tribunal easily come to conclusion the deceased also equally contributed negligence to the accident. Hence, it is decided the deceased contributed 50% negligence and the 1st Respondent's driver contributed 50% negligence to the accident and this point was decided accordingly. Point No.2: 10. The 1st petitioner is the wife, 2 and 3rd petitioners are the sons and 4th petitioner is the mother of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.6 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein the Doctor noted the following External Injuries:- 1. Reddish Brown abrasions, a) 4x2.5 cm on the front knee, b) 2.5x1.5 cm on front of right leg, c) 10x6.5 cm on the right side of abdomen. 2. Vertically oblique linear laceration 3.8x0.8x0.5 cm on the right parietal region of the scalp. On further dissection of head: Diffuse subgaleal hematoma on the occipital region of the calvarium; on opening the calvarium: Dark red subdural hematoma on bilateral fronto-parieto- occipital lobes and thin layer of sub arachnoid hemorrhage all over the surface of the brain was present; brain edematous; cut section was pale; linear 6.2 cm fissured fractured on the right side of occipital bone communicating with foramen magnum. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died of head injuries. 11. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in accident. The first Respondent insured the vehicle with the 2nd Respondent and the insurance was in force on the date of accident and this fact was 6 proved through Ex.P.7 copy of Insurance Policy certificate. The 1st Respondent's driver also has valid driving license to drive the offending vehicle at the time of accident and this fact was proved from entries in Ex.P.3, MVI report. Hence, the Respondents are liable to pay compensation to the claimants. AGE 12. The claimants not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of deceased person. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 45 years. The Ex.P.8 is the xerox copy driving license of the deceased and wherein the date of birth of deceased was mentioned as 15.6.1967 and it is proved the age of deceased was 47 years, 17 days and he crossed the age of 47 and hence the age of deceased was fixed to 48 years at the time of accident. INCOME 13. The petitioners claimed Rs. 45,00,000/- as compensation. The P.W. 1 deposed the deceased owned Auto and he himself drive the Auto. In Ex.R.1 report also it is mentioned the deceased was owner cum driver. The P.W.1 deposed that at the time of accident the deceased earned Rs. 20,000/- per month. There was no evidence to show the income proof. The petitioners not proved that whether the deceased was income tax payer. However, considering the deceased was owner cum driver of the Auto and t he socio-economic condition forced to any individual to earn for his living, this court fixed the monthly income of the deceased was Rs. 15,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 14. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546 , the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary, to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. The deceased in this case not getting standard income and hence as per the recent ruling reported in Chikkamma & another -Vs- Paravathamma & another, in C.A.No. 3409/2017, dated 28.2.2017, being the deceased was under unorganized sectors the concept of future prospects not applicable for this case. 7 Deductions: 15. The deceased was married person at the time of accident. There are 4 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted ¼th of income towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After ¼th deduction, the loss of dependency fixed as Rs.15,000 – 3,750 = 11,250/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF DEPENDENCY 16. Considering the age of the deceased is 48 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 13 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore t he “loss of dependency” to the family is arrived to Rs. 11,250x12x13=Rs. 17,55,000/-. It is already decided the deceased contributed 50% negligence to the accident. Hence, after deducting 50% of compensation towards contributed negligence of deceased, the loss of dependency to the family decided to Rs. 8,77,500/-. COMPENSATION FOR CONSORTIUM AND LOVE AND AFFECTION CONSORTIUM 17. In Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2009 (2) TN MAC 36 (SC) and followed in Shashikala & another -Vs- Gangalakshmamana & another , 2015 (1) TN MAC 785 (SC) it has held that “Loss of consortium is usually for loss for spouse’s affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations for future years and in such circumstances, Courts to award at least Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation for Loss of Consortium” and this position followed in Reliance General Insurance Co Ltd -Vs-K.Meena & others, 2015 (2) TNMAC 449 .

However, a small amount of Rs.1,00,000/- is considered in the lumpsum calculation towards love and affection. 8 Funeral Expenses : 19. Decent burial is also one on the right under Article 21 of our constitution. The petitioners have failed to produce any expenditure statement relating to the funeral expenses, so the tribunal has awarded a minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- for the head, also relied the Judgment in Rajesh v. Rajbir singh [CDJ 2013 SC 485], the Hon’ble apex court has further held that “ Funeral expenses not only includes fee paid in crematorium or cementary but also includes religious practices and conventions performed on death in family. Hence in absence of any evidence to contrary, minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- to be awarded by Courts towards funeral expenses ”. Hence, a sum of Rs,25,000/- alone was considered and fixed the award in lumpsum manner. Loss of Estate, Transport Expenses and damages for articles:- 20.

Petitioners. /Vs/ 1. E. Prabakaran `2. Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd., Rep. By its Divisional Manager, Vellore... Respondents. This petition, coming up for final hearing before me, on 28.3.2017, in the presence of Thiru. V. Padmanaban, Advocate for the Petitioners and Thiru. J. Chitti Babu, counsel for the 2nd respondent and the 1st Respondent remained absent and set exparte and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court doth delivereth the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 3. Name of deceased Person : V. Paneerselvam 4. Age of the person dead : 45 years 5. Occupation : Auto Owner cum Driver 6. Income pleaded : Rs.20,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 2.7.2014 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.45,00,000/- 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the wife, sons and mother of the deceased Paneerselvam who died in a road accident. That on 2.7.2014 at about 2.45 P.M, opposite to Government High School, Perumugai, while the deceased was driving his own Auto bearing Reg.No. TN-23-BB-7081, from south to 2 North at normal speed by following traffic rules, at that time the Maxi Cab van bearing Regn.No. TN-20-BL-0911, owned by the 1st respondent was driven by its driver Mr. Navasakthy Dev in a rash and negligent manner without following the traffic rules and regulation and without blowing horn from West to East direction in hurried manner and suddenly the van driver lost control and dashed against the rear side of Auto and due to strong hit the Auto was capsized and rolled two times and as a result of accident the deceased sustained head injury and multiple injuries on all over the body and immediately taken to Government Hospital at Vellore and died subsequently. The accident was reported to Sathuvachari P olice and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 205/2014, u/s. 279 & 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and working as Auto owner cum driver and earned Rs.20,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs. 45,00,000/- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 2nd RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. This Respondent denied the manner of accident. It is denied the death was caused due to the injuries. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. The relationship of the claimants with the deceased and right to claim compensation was denied. The deceased drove the Auto without F.C, Permit and Insurance and he had no valid driving license to drive Auto. The allegation that the 1st Respondent's driver drove the van in rash and negligent manner and caused the accident was denied. But the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent act of the deceased, who suddenly crossed the road without noticing the vehicles coming in the NH road. The deceased also contributed negligence to the accident. The 1st Respondent's driver has no valid driving licence to drive the offending vehicle and it was violation of terms of Insurance policy and hence this Respondent is not liable to pay the compensation amount. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 3 5. The 2nd petitioner examined as PW1 and Ex.P1 to Ex.P.8 marked on the side of the Petitioners. The 2nd Respondent examined Mr. Kumar, investigator as R.W.1 and through him Ex.R1 to R3 marked. POINT NO.1: 6. It is admitted fact the 1st Respondent is the owner of the Maxi Cab Van bearing Reg.No. TN-20-BL-0911 which involved in the accident and Mr.Navasakthy Dev was driving the offending vehicle at the time of accident. It is the case of petitioners that while the deceased drove the Auto bearing Reg.No. TN-23-BB-7081 in a slow and careful manner, the 1st Respondent's driver drove the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed on rear side of the Auto and thereby caused accident. But, the 2nd Respondent contended the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in slow and careful manner and the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the Auto by the deceased. The offending vehicle was inspected by the MVI, and issued the Ex.P.3, M.V.I. report stating the tyre condition was satisfactory and the Breaking system was in order and the accident was occurred not due to mechanical defect. The MVI report for the Auto driven by the deceased was attached with Ex.R.3 document and wherein also mentioned there was no mechanical defect in the vehicle. The damages noted in the M.V.I. reports proved the 1st Respondent's van and the Auto driven by the deceased were involved in the accident. In this case the accident was admitted, but the manner of accident alone disputed. The police investigated the crime and filed charge sheet against the 1st Respondent's driver and this fact was proved from Ex.P.4 copy of charge sheet. After trial, the 1st Respondent's driver was acquitted from the offence and the copy of judgment rendered by the learned Judicial Magistrate No.V, Vellore, in C.C.No. 523/2014. It is settled position of law, the judgments of the criminal courts are not relevant and admissible in the trial of civil cases or MCOP cases except to the extent of showing that there was a criminal prosecution and the same resulted in conviction or acquittal. Since, there was no mechanical defect in both the vehicles and the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident and also pleaded for contributed negligence, irrespective of whether criminal prosecution launched or not and its result, the claimants have to prove the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver independently before this Tribunal. So, we have to decide whether the claimants have proved the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver and the 2nd Respondent has proved the allegation of contributory negligence against the deceased. 4 7. It is also settled law that the term rashness and negligence has to be construed lightly while making a decision on a petition for claim for the same as compared to the word rashness and negligence as mention in the Indian Penal Code . This is because the chapter in the Motor Vehicle Act dealing with compensation is a benevolent legislation and not a penal one. Minding this legal principle we have to consider whether the claimants have proved the negligence of the 1st Respondent's driver. The P.W.1 deposed that on 2.7.2014 at about 2.45 P.M, opposite to Government High School, Perumugai, when he was talking with his friend Prabu, his father, the deceased was driving his own Auto bearing Reg.No. TN-23-BB-7081, from South to North, at normal speed by following traffic rules, at that time on the same direction, the Maxi Cab van bearing Regn.No. TN-20-BL- 0911 was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and without blowing horn and dashed against the Auto and the deceased was admitted at Government Hospital at Vellore and died subsequently. 8. At request of 2nd Respondent the R.W.1, the Investigator has investigated the accident and filed Ex.R.1 report stating there was no negligence on the part of 1st Respondent's driver and hence he was acquitted from charge and filed the copy of acquittal judgment as Ex.R. 2. The deposition recorded before Judicial Magistrate No. V, Vellore and other records pertained to accident marked as Ex.R.3. The R.W.1 also deposed in support of 2nd Respondent. The perusal of R.W.1 evidence revealed that he has not conducted fair investigation and he just perused the records available at police station and simply concluded there was no rash and negligen t driving on the part of 1st Respondent's driver. It is admitted fact the accident was occurred on Chennai to Bangalore NH road. The rough sketch in Ex.R.3 proved the road at accident spot runs on East to West direction. It was elicited from cross examination of P.W.1, that at the time of accident, the deceased drove the Auto from East to West direction and take “U” turn towards North direction and perusal of rough sketch also corroborated the P.W.1 evidence. It is also proved the deceased drove the Auto at South side track and the 1st Respondent's driver drove the van at North track from West to East direction and when the deceased take “U” turn towards north, the van was dashed against the Auto. These facts not stated in the Ex.R.1 report. 9. The 2nd Respondent contended the deceased also contributed negligence to the accident. The contributory negligence is a sharing of responsibility for damage where a person suffers damage as a result partly of his own fault and partly of the fault of any 5 other person. The 1st Respondent's driver was the best person to depose about the allegation of the contributory negligence. The petitioner counsel argued t he 2nd Respondent has not put the 1st Respondent's driver into the witness box to state as to how the accident occurred and to depose that he was not at fault and was not driving the vehicle in rash and negligent manner or the allegation of contributory negligence. It is not necessary to examine the 1st Respondent's driver to prove the allegation of contributory negligence. The P.W.1 evidence itself is enough to decide about the allegation of contributory negligence. The P.W.1 evidence proved the deceased take “U” turn towards North direction without noticing the vehicles coming on the Northern track. The deceased, being driver, before taking “U” turn, failed to take care to seen the vehicle coming at Northern side track. Therefore, this Tribunal easily come to conclusion the deceased also equally contributed negligence to the accident. Hence, it is decided the deceased contributed 50% negligence and the 1st Respondent's driver contributed 50% negligence to the accident and this point was decided accordingly. Point No.2: 10. The 1st petitioner is the wife, 2 and 3rd petitioners are the sons and 4th petitioner is the mother of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.6 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein the Doctor noted the following External Injuries:- 1. Reddish Brown abrasions, a) 4x2.5 cm on the front knee, b) 2.5x1.5 cm on front of right leg, c) 10x6.5 cm on the right side of abdomen. 2. Vertically oblique linear laceration 3.8x0.8x0.5 cm on the right parietal region of the scalp. On further dissection of head: Diffuse subgaleal hematoma on the occipital region of the calvarium; on opening the calvarium: Dark red subdural hematoma on bilateral fronto-parieto- occipital lobes and thin layer of sub arachnoid hemorrhage all over the surface of the brain was present; brain edematous; cut section was pale; linear 6.2 cm fissured fractured on the right side of occipital bone communicating with foramen magnum. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died of head injuries. 11. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in accident. The first Respondent insured the vehicle with the 2nd Respondent and the insurance was in force on the date of accident and this fact was 6 proved through Ex.P.7 copy of Insurance Policy certificate. The 1st Respondent's driver also has valid driving license to drive the offending vehicle at the time of accident and this fact was proved from entries in Ex.P.3, MVI report. Hence, the Respondents are liable to pay compensation to the claimants. AGE 12. The claimants not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of deceased person. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 45 years. The Ex.P.8 is the xerox copy driving license of the deceased and wherein the date of birth of deceased was mentioned as 15.6.1967 and it is proved the age of deceased was 47 years, 17 days and he crossed the age of 47 and hence the age of deceased was fixed to 48 years at the time of accident. INCOME 13. The petitioners claimed Rs. 45,00,000/- as compensation. The P.W. 1 deposed the deceased owned Auto and he himself drive the Auto. In Ex.R.1 report also it is mentioned the deceased was owner cum driver. The P.W.1 deposed that at the time of accident the deceased earned Rs. 20,000/- per month. There was no evidence to show the income proof. The petitioners not proved that whether the deceased was income tax payer. However, considering the deceased was owner cum driver of the Auto and t he socio-economic condition forced to any individual to earn for his living, this court fixed the monthly income of the deceased was Rs. 15,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 14. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546 , the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary, to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. The deceased in this case not getting standard income and hence as per the recent ruling reported in Chikkamma & another -Vs- Paravathamma & another, in C.A.No. 3409/2017, dated 28.2.2017, being the deceased was under unorganized sectors the concept of future prospects not applicable for this case. 7 Deductions: 15. The deceased was married person at the time of accident. There are 4 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted ¼th of income towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After ¼th deduction, the loss of dependency fixed as Rs.15,000 – 3,750 = 11,250/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF DEPENDENCY 16. Considering the age of the deceased is 48 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 13 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore t he “loss of dependency” to the family is arrived to Rs. 11,250x12x13=Rs. 17,55,000/-. It is already decided the deceased contributed 50% negligence to the accident. Hence, after deducting 50% of compensation towards contributed negligence of deceased, the loss of dependency to the family decided to Rs. 8,77,500/-. COMPENSATION FOR CONSORTIUM AND LOVE AND AFFECTION CONSORTIUM 17. In Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2009 (2) TN MAC 36 (SC) and followed in Shashikala & another -Vs- Gangalakshmamana & another , 2015 (1) TN MAC 785 (SC) it has held that “Loss of consortium is usually for loss for spouse’s affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations for future years and in such circumstances, Courts to award at least Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation for Loss of Consortium” and this position followed in Reliance General Insurance Co Ltd -Vs-K.Meena & others, 2015 (2) TNMAC 449 . The 1st petitioner is wife and aged about 39 years at the time of the accident, which is the crucial period, at which time she very needed the companionship of her husband and for which Rs.1,00,000/- is awarded.  Loss of Love & affection & Mental Agony and loss of Expectancy of life : 18.

The petitioners 2 and 3 are the sons and 4th petitioner is the mother of the deceased and they have lost love & affection of the deceased and it is not measurable by money. However, a small amount of Rs.1,00,000/- is considered in the lumpsum calculation towards love and affection. 8 Funeral Expenses : 19. Decent burial is also one on the right under Article 21 of our constitution. The petitioners have failed to produce any expenditure statement relating to the funeral expenses, so the tribunal has awarded a minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- for the head, also relied the Judgment in Rajesh v. Rajbir singh [CDJ 2013 SC 485], the Hon’ble apex court has further held that “ Funeral expenses not only includes fee paid in crematorium or cementary but also includes religious practices and conventions performed on death in family. Hence in absence of any evidence to contrary, minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- to be awarded by Courts towards funeral expenses ”. Hence, a sum of Rs,25,000/- alone was considered and fixed the award in lumpsum manner. Loss of Estate, Transport Expenses and damages for articles:- 20. This Tribunal not considered future prospects and hence t his Tribunal awarded Rs. 50,000/- towards loss of estate. The petitioners not produced any documentary evidence showing the actual expenses for transport expenses. However, this Tribunal awarded Rs. 5000/- towards transport expenses. The petitioners not accounted for the actual damages caused to Auto in accident. Hence, this Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs. 2000/- towards damage to clothes and articles. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 8,77,500 2.Loss of consortium ...Rs. 1,00,000 3.Loss of Love & Affection …Rs. 1,00,000 4.Loss of estate ...Rs . 50,000 5.Medical Expenses …Rs.

THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the parents of the deceased Vinayagamurthy who died in a road accident. That on 1.6.2014 at about 3.30 P.M, while the deceased was riding in bi-cycle to go to Virinjipuram proceeding 2 from Chennai to Bangalore NH road, he was standing at Vallandaraman koot road, and waiting for cross the road, the TATA van bearing Regn.No. TN-22-Y-3992, owned by the 1st respondent was driven by its driver Mr. Loganathan in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and as a result of the accident the deceased sustained grievous injury on all over the body and immediately he has been taken to Government Hospital at Vellore by N.H ambulance, but treatment failed and he died on the same day at 11.00 P.M. The accident was reported to Virinjipuram P olice and they have registered a case in Cr. No.177/2014, u/s. 279 & 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and doing Mason work and also Agriculturist and earned Rs.25,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs. 15,00,000/- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 2nd RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. The 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in slow and careful manner following all traffic rules. But the accident was occurred only due to sudden cross by the deceased without noticing the vehicle. The 1st Respondent's driver has no valid driving license to drive the vehicle involved in the accident and it was violation of terms of Insurance policy and hence this Respondent is not liable to pay the compensation amount. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent ? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner examined as PW1 and Mr. Arunkumar examined as PW2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P.8 marked on the side of the Petitioners. No oral and documentary evidence for the 2nd respondent. POINT NO.1 6. It is admitted fact the 1st Respondent is the owner of the offending TATA van bearing Reg.No. TN-22-Y-3992 and it was driven by one Loganathan as a driver at the time of accident. The petitioners contended the 1st Respondent's driver drove the offending 3 vehicle in a rash and negligence manner and dashed against the deceased who stand along with Bi-cycle and caused fatal injuries to the deceased and died on the same day. But, the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident as pleaded by the petitioners and contended that the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in a slow and careful manner and the accident was happened due to the sudden cross of the deceased on NH road without noticing the on coming vehicles. The offending vehicle was inspected by the MVI and issued the Ex.P.5 M.V.I. report stating the tyre condition was satisfactory and the Breaking system was found intact and there was no mechanical defect in the offending vehicle. Since, the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident as pleaded by the claimants and there was no mechanical defect in the offending vehicle, we have to decide whether the 1st Respondent's driver is responsible for the accident and there was any contributory negligence on the part of deceased. 7. The P.W.1 deposed that on 1.6.2014 at about 3.30 P.M, while the deceased was riding in a bi-cycle to go to Virinjipuram proceeding from Chennai to Bangalore NH road, he was standing at Vallandaraman koot road, he has waiting for cross the road at centre meridian area, the TATA van bearing Regn.No. TN-22-Y-3992 was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and as a result of the accident the deceased sustained grievous injury on all over the body and immediately he was taken to Government Hospital at Vellore. The P.W.1 not seen the accident directly and hence the P.W.1 evidence is not sufficient to prove the manner of accident. 8. The P.W.2 examined as occurrence witness and he deposed that on 1.6.2014 at about 3.30 P.M, while he was standing in front of tea shop at Vallandaraman koot road, the deceased was riding a bi-cycle to go to Virinjipuram proceeding from Chennai to Bangalore NH road and waiting for cross the road at centre meridian area and at that time the TATA van bearing Regn.No. TN-22-Y-3992 was driven by its driver from West to East direction in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and as a result of the accident the deceased sustained grievous injury on all over the body and immediately he was taken to Government Hospital at Vellore by N.H ambulance, but treatment failed and he died on the same day. 9. The 2nd petitioner reported the accident to Virinjipuram police station and they have registered a case in Cr.No. 177/2014 for offence u/s 279 & 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and wherein also it was stated the 1st Respondent's driver 4 drove the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. After investigation the police has filed the charge sheet against the 1st Respondent driver and this fact proved through the Ex.P. 8 copy of charge sheet. 10. The 2nd Respondent has not put the 1st Respondent's driver stepped into the witness box to state as to how accident occurred and to depose that he was not at fault and was not driving the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner or the allegation of sudden cross by the deceased. On the other hand the P.W. 2 evidence proved that the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver. Hence it is decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver. Point No.2: 11. The petitioners are the parents of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.6 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein the Doctor noted the following Injuries:- 1. 6x2 cm sutured laceration on the left forehead. 2. 10x4 cm grazed abrasion on the left cheek 3. Crush injury left leg below knee (Both bone fractured) 4. 4x2 cm abrasion on the left forearm 5. Irregular abrasion on the left temporo parietal region 6. 5x3 cm abrasion on the right knee. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died due to crush injury. 12. It is already decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in accident. The first Respondent insured the vehicle with the 2nd Respondent and the insurance was in force on the date of accident and this fact was proved through Ex.P.3 copy of Insurance Policy certificate. The Ex.P. 4 is the driving license of the 1st Respondent's driver with badge endorsement and it proved the 1st Respondent's driver has valid driving license at the time of accident to drive the offending vehicle. Hence, the Respondents are liable to pay compensation to the claimants. 5 AGE 13. The claimants not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of deceased person. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 21 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report the age of deceased was appeared to be 21 years. Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximately the age recorded in Ex.P.2 Postmortem Certificate treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 21 years at the time of accident. INCOME 14. The petitioners claimed Rs. 15,00,000/- as compensation. It is the case of petitioners that the deceased was working as a Mason and also an Agriculturist at the time of accident and earned Rs.20,000/- per month. There was no evidence to show the income proof. The socio-economic condition forced to any individual to earn at the rate of Rs.200/- per day for his living. This court also consider the citation in Sadiq and others Vs. Divisional Manager United India Insurance Co., Ltd. 2014 ACJ 627, the claimant was a vegetable vendor who met with an accident in 2008 and the Hon'ble Supreme Court assessed income at Rs.6,500/-p.m. Considering the above legal position and age of deceased, this Tribunal has fixed the monthly income of deceased person as Rs.6,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 15. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. Recently in a ruling reported in in Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (2) TNMAC 55(SC): 2013 (9) SCC 54 , it was decided future prospects applicable in a case of self-employed persons also. The annual income of the deceased was Rs.6,000x12 =72,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased 50% of income added towards future prospects and the monthly income arrived to Rs. 6000+3000=9000/-. 6 Deductions: 16. The deceased was bachelor person at the time of accident. There are 2 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted ½ income towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After ½ deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs.4500/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 17. Considering the age of the deceased is 21 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 18 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore the compensation calculated to Rs.4500x12x18=Rs. 9,72,000/- and therefore the petitioners are entitled Rs. 9,72,000/- as compensation towards loss of income. COMPENSATION FOR LOVE AND AFFECTION 18.

Decent burial is also one on the right under Art 21 of our constitution, The petitioner has failed to produced any expenditure statement relating to the funeral expenses, so the tribunal has awarded a minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- for the head, also relied the Judgment in Rajesh v. Rajbir singh [CDJ 2013 SC 485], the Hon’ble apex court has further held that “ Funeral expenses not only includes fee paid in crematorium or cementary but also includes religious practices and conventions performed on death in family. Hence in absence of any evidence to contrary, minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- to be awarded by Courts towards funeral expenses ”. Hence, a sum of Rs,25,000/- alone was considered and fixed the award in lumpsum manner. Loss of Estate, Transport Expenses and damages for articles:- 20.

The Divisional Manager, The New India Assurance Company Limited, Vellore. .. Respondents. This petition is coming up for final hearing before me, on 23.02.2018, in the presence of Thiru S. Dakshnamoorthy, Advocate for the Petitioners and Thiru K.M. Saravanan, Advocate for the 2nd respondent and the 1st respondent remained absent and set exparte and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court delivered the following: ORDER Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec.166 of MV Act. 3. Name of deceased : Durai 4. Age of the deceased : 35 years 5. Occupation : Landlord 6. Income pleaded : Rs.30,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 28.08.2015 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.50,00,000/- 2 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The 1st petitioner is the wife, 2nd and 3rd petitioners are the children and 4th and 5th petitioners are the parents of the deceased Durai. On 28.08.2015 at 03.30 P.M., while the deceased Durai was standing along with motorcycle bearing registration No. TN 25 AV 9533 on the left side of road at Varagoor, Pattikulamedu, near Annadurai land, at that time, the tractor bearing registration No.TN 32 H 1675 was suddenly reversed by its driver rashly and negligently and hit against the deceased and as a result of which, the deceased fell down and the tractor ran over the head of the deceased and caused him instantaneous death on the spot. Thimiri police have also registered a case in Crime No.282/2015 u/s 279 and 304(A) of IPC., against the tractor driver. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and he was a landlord and he earned Rs.30,000/- per month. The deceased was the sole bread winner of the family. Due to the sudden demise of the deceased, the petitioners' entire future life is fully doomed and questionable. The 1st respondent is the owner of the Tractor and the 2nd respondent is the Insurance Company of the said vehicle which involved in the accident. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming compensation of Rs.50,00,000/- for the death of Durai in the accident. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR THE 2nd RESPONDENT:- The petition is not sustainable in law and on facts. The respondent did not admit any of the allegations made in the petition save those that are specifically admitted. The allegations regarding the age, occupation and monthly income of the deceased are denied. The manner of accident was also denied. The vehicle involved in the accident was not insured with the 2nd respondent. The driver of the vehicle has not possessed valid driving licence at the time of accident. The deceased died due to his own negligence. There is no rashness or negligent on the part of the driver of the tractor. The petitioners have not impleaded the owner and the insurer of the two wheeler bearing registration No.TN 25 AV 9533. This petition is bad for non joinder of necessary parties. The amount claimed is highly excessive. Hence, the petition is liable to be dismissed. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent ? 2. Whether the respondents are liable to pay compensation to the petitioners? 3 3. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. On the side of the petitioners, P.W.1 and 2 were examined. Ex.P1 to P8 were marked. No oral and documentary evidence were let in on the side of the respondents. The 2nd respondent has filed a petition in IA No.119/2018 u/s 170 M.V. Act and the same was allowed on 14.02.2018. POINT NO.1: 6. It is admitted fact that the 1st Respondent is the owner of the Tractor bearing Reg.No. TN-32-H-1675 and it was driven by one Iyappan on the date of accident. The petitioners contended the accident was happened only due to rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent's driver. The Ex.P4 is the MVI report and wherein it was stated that there was no mechanical defect in the vehicle. Since there was no mechanical defect in the vehicle we have to decide whether the 1st respondent's driver is responsible for the accident. 7. The 1st petitioner is the wife of the deceased and examined as P.W.1 and she deposed that on 28.08.2015 at 3.30 P.M. while the deceased was standing along with motorcycle bearing registration No. TN 25 AV 9533 on the left side of road at Varagoor, Pattikulamedu, near Annadurai land, at that time, the tractor bearing registration No.TN 32 H 1675 was suddenly reversed by its driver rashly and negligently without making any signal and hit against the deceased and as a result of which, the deceased fell down and the tractor ran over the head of the deceased and caused him instantaneous death on the spot. P.W.1 has stated in the cross examination that she had not seen the occurrence directly. One Elumalai was examined as P.W.2. He deposed that at the time of occurrence, he stood near the land of Annadurai and that the driver of the tractor vehicle - TN 32 H 1675 suddenly started the vehicle and applied reverse gear and dashed against the deceased due to which the deceased received crush injury in his head and died on the spot itself. The accident was reported to Thimiri police station and they have registered case in Cr.No. 282/2015 for the offences u/s 279 and 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P1. After the investigation, the tractor driver, namely, Iyappan was prosecuted for his rash driving and for causing death to said Durai, which is evidenced from Ex.P5 certified xerox copy of charge sheet. It is contended on the side of the 2nd 4 respondent that the deceased has invited the accident by his own negligence. But, no oral or documentary evidence was let in on the side of the 2nd respondent to prove the said contention. The death of the deceased was caused while the driver Iyappan took reverse of the tractor vehicle. Had he reversed the vehicle in a careful manner after confirming whether anybody was there on the rear side, this accident would not have occurred. Therefore, it is held that the accident took place only due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the tractor vehicle. The owner of the vehicle, the 1st respondent is vicariously liable for the negligent act of his driver. Ex.P7 is the xerox copy of driving licence of the driver Iyyappan. Ex.P8 xerox copy of Insurance Policy reveals that the offending vehicle was insured with the 2nd respondent and that the policy was in force at the time of accident. Hence, it is held that the 2nd respondent is liable to compensate the petitioners for the death of Durai and these points are answered thus. Point No.3: 8. The 1st petitioner is the wife and 2nd and 3rd petitioners are the minor children and 4th and 5th petitioners are the parents of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.3 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and it proved the deceased was died due to the injuries sustained in the accident. The Ex.P6 is the Transfer Certificate of the deceased. 9. It is already decided the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of Respondent's driver. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in the accident. Hence, the 2nd Respondent is liable to pay compensation to the claimants. AGE 10. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 35 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report also the approximate age of deceased was recorded as 35 years. The claimants have produced Ex.P6 Xerox copy of Transfer Certificate to prove the correct age of deceased person. As per Ex.P6, the date of birth of the deceased was noted as 04.06.1977. Considering the above document, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 38 years at the time of accident. 5 INCOME 11. The petitioners claimed Rs.50,00,000/- as compensation. The PW1 deposed that the deceased was a landlord and earned Rs.30,000/- per month. The petitioners have not produced any document showing the occupation and income of the deceased. In the absence of any proof to show that the deceased was a landlord and thereby he earned Rs.30,000/- per month, this tribunal could not take into account that the monthly income of the deceased would be Rs.30,000/-. C onsidering the age and date of accident, this Tribunal has fixed the notional income of deceased person as Rs.6,500/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 12. Recently the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided in The National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and Others, Special Leave petition (Civil) No. 25590 of 2014 order dated 31.10.2017, that in case of person has self employed on a fixed salary, an additional of 40% of the established income should be the warrant where the deceased was below the age of 40 years. An addition of 25% where the deceased was between the age of 40 to 50 years and 10% where the deceased was between the age of 50 to 60 years should be regarded as the necessary method of computation.In this case, the age of the deceased was 38 at the time of accident. He would definitely earn moderately to brought up the family in future had he been alive. So, this is a fit case to award compensation under the head of future prospects. Considering the income of the deceased was fixed to Rs. 6,500/-, the annual income of the deceased was Rs. 6,500 x 12 = 78,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased was fixed to 38 years at the time of accident 40% of income added towards future prospects and the monthly income arrived to Rs. 6,500+2600/- =Rs.9,100/-. Deductions: 13. The deceased was married person at the time of accident. There are 5 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/5th of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/5th deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs.9,100 – 1820 = Rs.7,280/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 14. Considering the age of the deceased is 38 years and as per the dictum laid 6 down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 15 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, the compensation calculated to Rs.7,280/- x 12 x 15 = Rs.13,10,400/- and therefore the petitioners are entitled Rs. 13,10,400/- as compensation towards loss of income. LOVE AND AFFECTION 15. The 2nd and 3rd petitioners are minor children and the petitioners 4 and 5 are the parents of the deceased. They have lost their love & affection of the deceased. Hence, a lumpsum of Rs.1,00,000/- is awarded as compensation towards love and affection. 16. As per the dictum laid down in The National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and Others, Special Leave petition (Civil) No. 25590 of 2014 order dated 31.10.2017, This tribunal awarded Rs.40,000/- towards loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner, Rs.15,000/- is awarded towards funeral expenses. Apart from this, Rs. 10,000/- is granted towards transport expenses. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 13,10,400/- 2.Loss of Love & Affection …Rs. 1,00,000/- 3.Loss of consortium ...Rs. 40,000/- 4.Funeral expenses ...Rs. 15,000/- 5.Transport expenses ...Rs. 10,000/- ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 14,75,400/- ------------------------- 17. In the result, this petition is allowed with costs and the petitioners are entitled for Rs. 14,75,400/- (Rupees Fourteen Lakhs Seventy-Five thousand and Four hundred only) as compensation . The 2nd respondent is directed to pay and deposit the award amount into this court within 4 weeks from this day with interest at 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this petition (17.11.2015) till the date of deposit, excluding period of default if any.

In spite of continuous treatment the injured succumbed to death. 8. To strengthen their claim the petitioners would file Ex.P1, FIR, registered by Vellore Taluk Police in crime number 921/2013. The said police had registered a criminal case against the 1st respondent U/S 279, 337 IPC. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent would examine a Private Investigator as RW1 and mark his report as Ex.R1. From Ex.P1, FIR and Ex.R1 private investigation report it can be found that Vellore Taluk Police had sent an alteration report to Judicial Magistrate No.1, Vellore. The charge against the 1st respondent had been altered to 279, 304(A) IPC. PW2, police official attached to Vellore Taluk Police admits the above facts. 9. The accident is not denied, but, the learned counsel for the 2nd respondent would contend that the accident did not take place as deposed by PW1 or PW2. He would submit that on the date of accident the motor-cycle rider came in a slow manner and it was the deceased who had suddenly crossed the road without noticing the motor-cycle and invited the accident. The 2nd respondent would further add that the deceased Pavunammal at the time of accident was mentally retarded. In this scenario he would attribute contributory negligence on the petitioner. To prove his case he would rely on the FIR and rough sketch. In the FIR it is stated that the accident took place when Pavunammal was crossing the road from east to west. But, quite contra the as per Ex.R2, 4 rough sketch the SOC is on the extreme left hand side of the north-south road. I have carefully gone through the FIR, rough sketch and the evidence of PW1 and PW2. I do not find any evidence for contributory negligence. From the available evidence it can be seen that the accident had occurred due to the negligence of the 1st respondent. Therefore, I hold that the 1st respondent had negligently caused the accident. This point is answered accordingly. POINT NO.2: 10. The petitioners claim a sum of 23,00,000/- as compensation for the death of ₹ Pavunammal. The 1st petitioner is the mother of the deceased. The 2nd and 3rd petitioners are the brother and sister of the deceased. The ExP4, Legal Heir certificate shows that the 1st petitioner is the sole legal heir of the deceased. However, it cannot be denied that the 3rd and 4th petitioners are the dependents of the deceased. From Ex.P2, Postmortem certificate it can be noted that the doctor who had conducted the autopsy had opined that the deceased would appear to have died due to head injuries. 11. The claimants have not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of the deceased. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased is shown as 48. In Ex.P2, Postmortem report the age of the deceased is recorded as 50 years. As there is no direct evidence to prove the age of the deceased, from the postmortem report the age of the deceased Pavunammal is fixed at 50 years at the time of accident. 12. The petitioners claimed that the deceased was doing coolie work and earning a sum 10,000/- per month. The claimants would file Ex.P5, Vocational Training Certificate ₹ issued by Self Help Association for Rural Education and Employment, Vellore. They would content that the deceased as a skill worker was earning substantially and supporting her family. On the other hand the learned counsel for the 2nd respondent would oppose the certificate as a basic certificate issued to mentally retarded person for doing craft work. But, to prove this fact no contra evidence was let in. In absence of income proof as per the dictum laid in Syed Saduq and others Vs. Divisional Manager, United India Insurance Co.Ltd., the monthly income of the deceased is fixed at 6500/-. ₹ 13. The learned counsel for the petitioners would submit that future prospects should be considered along with income. In the reported decision in Sarala Verma Vs 5 Delhi Transport Corporation (2009 2 SCC 1546), our Honorable Supreme Court had held that in case of person having permanent job below 40 years, an addition of 50% can be added towards future prospects, whereas for persons between 40 to 50 years, for future prospects only 30% can be considered. Furthermore, for persons above 50 years there should be no addition towards future prospects. In the case in hand the age of the deceased is 50 years. So, I am not considering any amount towards future prospects. So, the monthly income of the deceased is fixed at 6500/- per month. ₹ 14. There are three claimants. As per the ruling laid in Sarala Verma Vs Delhi Transport Corporation (2009 2 SCC 1546), this court deducts 50% salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After ½ deduction the monthly income of the deceased is fixed at 3250x12= 39,000/-. Considering the age of the deceased as 50 ₹ ₹ years and as per the dictum laid in Sarala Verma Vs Delhi Transport Corporation (2009 2 SCC 1546), a multiplier of 13 is adopted for calculating compensation. Therefore, the compensation amount towards loss of income would be 39,000/- x 13 = 5,07,000/-. ₹ ₹ 15. For compensation towards love and affection, considering the fact that the deceased is unmarried and the 1st petitioner being the mother aged 70 years and the other two claimants being brother and sister, I am awarding a sum of 25,000/- each. Total ₹ 75,000/-. Also, I am considering a sum of 25,000/- towards funeral expenses. This₹ ₹ tribunal further considers a sum of 5000/- towards transport expenses and a sum of ₹ 2000/- towards damages to clothes and articles. ₹ 16. Considering the above facts, this court awards compensation as follows: 1. Loss of income ₹5,07,000/- 2. Loss of Love and affection 75₹ ,000/- 3. Funeral expenses 25₹ ,000/- 4. Transportation ₹ 5,000/- 5. Loss towards personal belonging 2,000/₹ - Total 6₹,14,000/- 6 POINT NO.3 : 17. The 1st respondent had duly insured his vehicle with the 2nd respondent. The 2nd respondent admits this fact, but, he would contend that at the time of accident the 1st respondent was not having a valid driving license to drive a motor-cycle. To prove this fact, he would examine RW1, an official of his insurance company and through him, he would file Ex.R1, Private Investigation Report. In this regard, it is pertinent to note that the 1st respondent had paid fine for not having driving license. Ex.R4, is the CR issued by MVI Vellore. 18. As per the terms of insurance policy a person should posses a valid license to drive a motor-cycle. As rightly put forth by the 2nd respondent, it is policy violation and as such the insurance company is not liable to indemnify for the negligent act of 1st respondent. On the side of the petitioner it was contended that as far as the claimants are concerned they are third parties and their interest should be protected. 19. So, considering the fact that the petitioners are third party claimants and that they should not suffer for the mischief of 1st respondent and also on the lines of various judgments of our Apex court, I consider that the principle of 'Pay and Recover' should be applied for the case in hand. Therefore, the 2nd respondent as insurer is directed to pay compensation to the petitioner and later, recover the amount from the 1st respondent. This point is answered accordingly. 20. In the result, this petition is partly allowed with cost and the 2nd respondent is ordered to pay a compensation of 6,14,000/-( Six Lakhs Fourteen thousand only)₹ ₹ to the petitioners with interest at the rate of 7.5% from the date of petition (11.09.2015) till the date of payment in the first instance and later recover the same from the 1st respondent or from the owner of the insured vehicle. The 1st petitioner who is the mother of the deceased is entitled to get 4,14,000/- from the above award amount. The 2 ₹nd and 3rd petitioners are entitled to get 1,00,000/- each from the award amount. In the first instance, the ₹ petitioners 1 to 3 are ordered to receive 50% of the award amount along with entire accrued interest and costs. The balance amount is ordered to be deposited in a Nationalized Bank for a period of three years. Time for payment of compensation and interest is one month. The petitioners had paid 2/- as court fee. The petitioners had been ₹ exempted from paying the court fee at the time of filing and he is directed to deposit the 7 deficit court fee of Rs. . 5510.50 into court within 15 days, failing which they are not ₹ entitled to interest for the default period.

Date of Accident : 05.10.2013 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.23,00,000/- 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the mother and brothers of the deceased Pavunu Ammal who died in a road accident. That on 05.10.2013 at 11.30 A.M., while the deceased was crossing the road from west to east, a Hero Honda CD Dawn two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-23-J-5743 came from Vellore to 2 Kaniyambadi driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and dashed the deceased and as a result, Pavuvu ammal sustained grievous injuries and she was taken to GVMCH, Vellore and then shifted to Government General Hospital, Chennai and due to the severe head injury, she died on 06.10.2013. The accident was reported to Vellore Taluk P.S. and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 921/2013, u/s. 279, 337 of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and working as coolie and earned Rs.10,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners are suffering from food and clothing and lost their supporter in life. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs. 23,00,000/- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 2nd RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The date, time and manner of accident are not admitted. The accident was occurred due to the negligent of the deceased and not due to the rash and negligent riding of the rider of the two wheeler. The rider of the 1st respondent not having valid driving license at the time of accident and hence there is a violation of policy condition. The amount claimed is highly exorbitant. Hence, this Respondent is not liable to pay the compensation amount. 4. In the course of trial, the learned counsel for the 2nd respondent filed a petition U/S 170 M.V. Act, contending that he apprehend collusion between the petitioner and the 1st respondent as he had neither furnished vital information regarding the accident nor filed claim petition. This court permitted the 2nd respondent to avail all or any other defense the 1st respondent may plead by allowing the application in I.A.748/16 dated 20.12.2016. 5. The points to be decided in this petition are : 1.Whether the accident had occurred due to the rash and negligent act of the 1st respondent or not? 2.What is the compensation amount the claimants are entitled to? 3.If so, from whom to be paid? 6. The 1st petitioner examined as PW1 and Mr. Senthil Kumar examined as PW2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P5 and Ex.X1 and Ex.X4 marked on the side of the Petitioners. Mr. 3 Sampath Kumar, the investigation officer of the 2nd respondent examined as RW1 and through him Ex.R1 to R4 marked. POINT NO.1: 7. From the contends of the FIR and evidence of PW1 and PW2, it can be seen that the accident had occurred on 05.10.2013 at about 11.30 am, when the deceased Pavunammal was crossing the road from west to east on the Vellore-Arani road near Sathumadurai Bajanai Koil Street Junction. From the further evidence of the said witnesses it can be seen that the 1st respondent at the time riding a Hero Honda CD deluxe motor-cycle bearing registration number TN23-J-5743, came from the north to south in a rash manner and hit the deceased. As a result of the sudden impact the deceased Pavunammal had fell on the road and sustained injuries. Immediately she was taken to Vellore Medical College Hospital for treatment and thereafter she was shifted to Chennai Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital for advance treatment. In spite of continuous treatment the injured succumbed to death. 8. To strengthen their claim the petitioners would file Ex.P1, FIR, registered by Vellore Taluk Police in crime number 921/2013. The said police had registered a criminal case against the 1st respondent U/S 279, 337 IPC. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent would examine a Private Investigator as RW1 and mark his report as Ex.R1. From Ex.P1, FIR and Ex.R1 private investigation report it can be found that Vellore Taluk Police had sent an alteration report to Judicial Magistrate No.1, Vellore. The charge against the 1st respondent had been altered to 279, 304(A) IPC. PW2, police official attached to Vellore Taluk Police admits the above facts. 9. The accident is not denied, but, the learned counsel for the 2nd respondent would contend that the accident did not take place as deposed by PW1 or PW2. He would submit that on the date of accident the motor-cycle rider came in a slow manner and it was the deceased who had suddenly crossed the road without noticing the motor-cycle and invited the accident. The 2nd respondent would further add that the deceased Pavunammal at the time of accident was mentally retarded. In this scenario he would attribute contributory negligence on the petitioner. To prove his case he would rely on the FIR and rough sketch. In the FIR it is stated that the accident took place when Pavunammal was crossing the road from east to west. But, quite contra the as per Ex.R2, 4 rough sketch the SOC is on the extreme left hand side of the north-south road. I have carefully gone through the FIR, rough sketch and the evidence of PW1 and PW2. I do not find any evidence for contributory negligence. From the available evidence it can be seen that the accident had occurred due to the negligence of the 1st respondent. Therefore, I hold that the 1st respondent had negligently caused the accident. This point is answered accordingly. POINT NO.2: 10. The petitioners claim a sum of 23,00,000/- as compensation for the death of ₹ Pavunammal. The 1st petitioner is the mother of the deceased. The 2nd and 3rd petitioners are the brother and sister of the deceased. The ExP4, Legal Heir certificate shows that the 1st petitioner is the sole legal heir of the deceased. However, it cannot be denied that the 3rd and 4th petitioners are the dependents of the deceased. From Ex.P2, Postmortem certificate it can be noted that the doctor who had conducted the autopsy had opined that the deceased would appear to have died due to head injuries. 11. The claimants have not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of the deceased. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased is shown as 48. In Ex.P2, Postmortem report the age of the deceased is recorded as 50 years. As there is no direct evidence to prove the age of the deceased, from the postmortem report the age of the deceased Pavunammal is fixed at 50 years at the time of accident. 12. The petitioners claimed that the deceased was doing coolie work and earning a sum 10,000/- per month. The claimants would file Ex.P5, Vocational Training Certificate ₹ issued by Self Help Association for Rural Education and Employment, Vellore. They would content that the deceased as a skill worker was earning substantially and supporting her family. On the other hand the learned counsel for the 2nd respondent would oppose the certificate as a basic certificate issued to mentally retarded person for doing craft work. But, to prove this fact no contra evidence was let in. In absence of income proof as per the dictum laid in Syed Saduq and others Vs. Divisional Manager, United India Insurance Co.Ltd., the monthly income of the deceased is fixed at 6500/-. ₹ 13. The learned counsel for the petitioners would submit that future prospects should be considered along with income. In the reported decision in Sarala Verma Vs 5 Delhi Transport Corporation (2009 2 SCC 1546), our Honorable Supreme Court had held that in case of person having permanent job below 40 years, an addition of 50% can be added towards future prospects, whereas for persons between 40 to 50 years, for future prospects only 30% can be considered. Furthermore, for persons above 50 years there should be no addition towards future prospects. In the case in hand the age of the deceased is 50 years. So, I am not considering any amount towards future prospects. So, the monthly income of the deceased is fixed at 6500/- per month. ₹ 14. There are three claimants. As per the ruling laid in Sarala Verma Vs Delhi Transport Corporation (2009 2 SCC 1546), this court deducts 50% salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After ½ deduction the monthly income of the deceased is fixed at 3250x12= 39,000/-. Considering the age of the deceased as 50 ₹ ₹ years and as per the dictum laid in Sarala Verma Vs Delhi Transport Corporation (2009 2 SCC 1546), a multiplier of 13 is adopted for calculating compensation. Therefore, the compensation amount towards loss of income would be 39,000/- x 13 = 5,07,000/-. ₹ ₹ 15. For compensation towards love and affection, considering the fact that the deceased is unmarried and the 1st petitioner being the mother aged 70 years and the other two claimants being brother and sister, I am awarding a sum of 25,000/- each. Total ₹ 75,000/-. Also, I am considering a sum of 25,000/- towards funeral expenses. This₹ ₹ tribunal further considers a sum of 5000/- towards transport expenses and a sum of ₹ 2000/- towards damages to clothes and articles. ₹ 16. Considering the above facts, this court awards compensation as follows: 1. Loss of income ₹5,07,000/- 2. Loss of Love and affection 75₹ ,000/- 3. Funeral expenses 25₹ ,000/- 4.

The respondent did not admit the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The accident was occurred due to the negligence of the deceased and not due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent driver. The amount claimed is excessive. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 3rd petitioner examined as PW1 and Mr. R.Mani examined as PW2. Ex.P1 to Ex.P10 marked on the side of the Petitioners. No oral and documentary evidence were let in on the side of the respondents. The 2nd respondent has filed a petition in IA No. 1311/2017 u/s 170 M.V. Act and the same was allowed on 22.10.2017. 3 POINT NO.1: 6. It is admitted fact the 1st Respondent is the owner of the lorry bearing Reg.No. AP-27-X-1935 which involved in the accident and Mr. Venkataramana Reddy was driving the offending vehicle at the time of accident. It is the case of petitioners that while the deceased Palani was travelled in Hero Passion XPRO bearing Reg.

The offending vehicle was inspected by the MVI and issued the Ex.P.3 M.V.I. report stating the tyre condition was satisfactory and the Breaking system was in order and there was no mechanical defect in the offending vehicle. Since, the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident as pleaded by the claimants and there was no mechanical defect in the offending vehicle, we have to decide whether the 1st Respondent's driver is responsible for the accident or the deceased alone responsible for the accident. 7. The P.W.1 deposed that the 1st Respondent's driver drove the offending lorry in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased two wheeler. The P.W.1 not seen the accident directly.

The PW2 denied the suggestion that the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of the two wheeler by the deceased. The accident was reported to Vellore Taluk police and they have registered a case in Crime No. 386/2014 u/s. 279 & 304(A) of IPC against the lorry driver and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and wherein also it was stated the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner 4 and dashed against the deceased. The Ex.P6 is the copy of the Driving license of the deceased. 8. The 1st Respondent's driver was the best person to depose about the manner of accident. The 2nd Respondent has not put the 1st Respondent's driver stepped into the witness box to state as to how accident occurred and to depose that he was not at fault and was not driving the vehicle in rash and negligent manner. On the other hand the careful perusal of P.W.2 evidence and Ex.P1 FIR, Ex.P3 MVI Report, it is proved the accident was occurred only due to rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver . Hence, it is decided the accident was occurred only due to rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver. Accordingly, this point is answered. POINT NO. 2 : 9. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of the deceased and wherein the Doctor mentioned that the deceased was died of head injuries. It is already decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in accident. The first Respondent insured the vehicle with the 2nd Respondent and the insurance was in force on the date of accident and this fact was proved through Ex.P.7 copy of Insurance Policy certificate. Hence, on behalf of the 1st respondent, the 2nd Respondent is liable to pay compensation to the claimants. 10. It is stated that at the time of accident, the deceased was aged about 26 years. The Ex.P10 is the xerox copy of Transfer certificate of the deceased and in which it is mentioned the date of birth of the deceased is 5.6.89 and he was completed 25 years, 3 months and 14 days and he crossed the age of 25 and hence it is decided the deceased was 26 years at the time of accident. INCOME 11. The petitioners claimed Rs.30,00,000/- as compensation for the death of Palani. It is stated the deceased was working as carpenter and earned Rs.20,000/- per month. The Ex.P8 is the cash receipt issued by labours welfare society. The Ex.P9 is the Membership Certificate issued by the Tamil Nadu Labour welfare Board. The petitioners have not filed any proof to show the income of the deceased. Considering there was no proof for income of the deceased and consid ering the age, avocation of the deceased, this Tribunal has fixed the monthly income of deceased person as Rs.9,000/- per month. 5 FUTURE PROSPECTS 12. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. The annual income of the deceased was Rs.9,000x12 = 1,08,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased 50% of income added towards future prospects and the monthly income arrived to Rs. 9000+4500 = 13,500/-. Deductions: 13. The deceased was married person at the time of accident. There are 3 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/3rd of income towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/3rd deduction, the monthly contribution to family was arrived to Rs.13,500 - 4,500 = 9000/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 14. Considering the age of the deceased is 26 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 17 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, the compensation calculated to Rs.9000x12x17=Rs.18,36,000/- and therefore the petitioners are entitled Rs.18,36,000/- as compensation towards loss of income. 15. The 1st petitioner claimed loss of consortium Rs.1,00,000/-. Indeed the 1st petitioner is young and aged 23 years and their would be definitely, loss of consortium as a wife and therefore Rs.50,000/- is granted as loss of consortium. For funeral expenses, the petitioners have claimed Rs.50,000/-, but not produced any document. However, a sum of Rs.15,000/- is granted towards funeral expenses. For loss of love and affection, the petitioners have claimed Rs.6,00,000/-, which is higher side.

Hence for each petitioners, Rs.25,000/- is considered and in total Rs.75,000/- is awarded towards love and affection. The petitioners claimed Rs. 2,00,000/- towards medical expenses, but they have not filed any proof and hence not granted. The petitioners have claimed Rs.3,50,000/- for mental shock and agony, Rs.6,00,000/- towards loss of expectation of life and Rs. 6,00,000/- towards loss of estate. Since this Tribunal considered 6 future prospects, not awarded any amount under the above heads. Apart from this tribunal is granted Rs.10,000/- towards transport expenses.

The 3rd petitioner is a handicapped person and he is not able to walk and he completely depends another person. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners lost the dependency. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs. 30,00,000/- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR 2nd RESPONDENT:- The petition is not maintainable either in law or on facts. The respondent denied all the allegations stated in the petition except those that are specifically admitted. The manner of the accident not admitted. The valid DL, IC of the erring vehicle have also been denied. The involvement of the alleged vehicle in the accident is denied. The respondent did not admit the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The accident was occurred due to the negligence of the deceased and not due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent driver. The amount claimed is excessive. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 3rd petitioner examined as PW1 and Mr. R.Mani examined as PW2. Ex.P1 to Ex.P10 marked on the side of the Petitioners. No oral and documentary evidence were let in on the side of the respondents. The 2nd respondent has filed a petition in IA No. 1311/2017 u/s 170 M.V. Act and the same was allowed on 22.10.2017. 3 POINT NO.1: 6. It is admitted fact the 1st Respondent is the owner of the lorry bearing Reg.No. AP-27-X-1935 which involved in the accident and Mr. Venkataramana Reddy was driving the offending vehicle at the time of accident. It is the case of petitioners that while the deceased Palani was travelled in Hero Passion XPRO bearing Reg.

The offending vehicle was inspected by the MVI and issued the Ex.P.3 M.V.I. report stating the tyre condition was satisfactory and the Breaking system was in order and there was no mechanical defect in the offending vehicle. Since, the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident as pleaded by the claimants and there was no mechanical defect in the offending vehicle, we have to decide whether the 1st Respondent's driver is responsible for the accident or the deceased alone responsible for the accident. 7. The P.W.1 deposed that the 1st Respondent's driver drove the offending lorry in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased two wheeler. The P.W.1 not seen the accident directly.

Income pleaded : Rs.50,000/ - 7. Date of Accident : 10.02.2014 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.20,00,000/- 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the legal heirs of the deceased Anbazhagan. That on 10.2.2014 at about 10.20 A.M, when the deceased was riding his motor cycle bearing Reg.No. TN-23-AP-2543, Hero Honda 2 Splendor, on the left side of the road on Chennai to Vellore road, near Nanthiyalam Anna Nagar Anchaneyar Koil, the bus bearing Regn.No. TN-23-N-1601, owned by the respondent was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner without showing any signal suddenly crossed the the road from N.H. to service road and the front side of the bus dashed against the two wheeler ride by the deceased and as a result of the accident, the deceased sustained fatal injuries on his head and and all over the body and immediately taken to Government Hospital , Walajah, and the Doctor declared already he died.

Prior to the accident the deceased was hale and healthy and working as Civil contractor as building construction and earned Rs.50,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming compensation of Rs.20,00,000/-. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR THE RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. This Respondent denied the dependency of the petitioners and their entitlement to claim compensation. This Respondent denied the date, time and manner of accident. This Respondent's driver drove the bus with due care and caution observing traffic rules stopped the bus at Nanthiyalam bus stop and after dropping and picking up passengers and he drove the bus in a slow manner and after lighting the indicator lamp he drove the bus to service road, the deceased ride the two wheeler in a rash and negligen t manner and over take the bus on left side against traffic rules and dashed against the barricade wall and there was no accident with the bus and hence this Respondent is not liable to pay any compensation to the petitioners. The deceased had no valid driving license and the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent act of the deceased and this claim application is not maintainable for want of Non-Joinder of necessary parties and the petitioners are not entitled to claim compensation from this Respondent. The petitioners are not dependents of the deceased and not entitled for compensation. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of Respondent's driver ? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 3 5. The 1st petitioner, Ponnusamy and Arjun examined respectively as PW1 to PW3. Mr. Dinakaran, the Respondent's driver examined as RW1. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P7 marked on the side of petitioners. No documents marked for Respondent. POINT NO.1: 6. It is admitted fact the Respondent is the owner of the bus bearing Reg.No. TN- 23-N-1601 and the R.W.1 drove the bus at the time of accident. The petitioners contended that when the deceased riding two wheeler with slow and careful manner, the R.W.1 suddenly crossed from the NH road to service road and dashed against the deceased and the accident was happened only due to rash and negligent driving of R.W.1. But, the Respondent contended the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent riding of the deceased. Both vehicles were inspected by M.V.I and the report for inspection of two wheeler marked as Ex.P.3 and inspection report for bus marked as Ex.P.4. It is proved from the Ex.P.3 and Ex.P.4 that the accident was occurred not due to mechanical defect. Since there was no mechanical defect in the Respondent's vehicle, we have to decide whether the R.W.1 was responsible for the accident. 7. The 1st petitioner is the wife of the deceased and examined as P.W.1 and she deposed that on 10.2.2014 at about 10.20 A.M, when the deceased was riding his motor cycle bearing Reg.No. TN-23-AP-2543, Hero Honda Splendor, on the left side of the road on Chennai to Vellore road, near Nanthiyalam Anna Nagar, near Anchaneyar Koil, the bus bearing Reg.No. TN-23-N-1601 was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner without showing any signal suddenly crossed into service road from N.H road and the front side of the bus dashed against the two wheeler and so that the deceased sustained fatal injuries on his head and all over the body and immediately taken to Government Hospital , Walajah, and Doctor declared already died. The P.W.1 not seen the accident directly and hence her evidence not useful to decide the manner of accident. 8. The P.W.2 examined as occurrence witness. The P.W.2 deposed 10.2.2014 at about 10.20 A.M, when he riding his two wheeler on Chennai to Vellore road, near Nanthiyalam Anna Nagar Anchaneyar Koil, the Government bus bearing Reg.No. TN-23- N-1601 was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and suddenly crossed on left side into service road and dashed against the two wheeler passing in front of him and the deceased sustained fatal injuries and immediately taken to Government Hospital , Walajah. The PW2 deposed in cross examination that the accident took place just 50 ft in 4 front of him and the Government bus coming in first lane on left side and denied the suggestion that the RW1 drive the bus in a slow manner. 9. The RW1 is the driver of 1st Respondent at the time of accident and deposed that he drove the vehicle in a slow and careful manner, but the deceased ride the two wheeler in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the bus. The accident was reported to Arcot Town police station and they have registered a case in Cr.No.68/2014 u/s 279 & 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and wherein it was stated the RW1 drove the bus in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. The RW1 admitted that the police has filed charge sheet against him and this fact was also proved from the Ex.P.5 copy of charge sheet. The PW2 evidence also proved the accident was occurred only due to rash and negligen t driving of RW1. Hence, it is decided the RW1 drove the bus in a rash and negligent manner and caused accident. Point No.2: 10. The 1st petitioner is the wife and 2nd and 3rd petitioners are Minor daughters and this fact was proved through Ex.P.6 legal heirship certificate. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein noted the following External Injuries:- 1. Abrasion 1x2cms in Right knee; Abrasion 1x2cm in left knee; Abrasion 21x5cms right elbow, Abrasion right side of check 10x5 cms; 2. Nasal bleeding and ear bleeding from both ears. 3. Multiple abrasions extended from neck to right axilla, 4. Fracture of right mandible, fracture of right maxilla 5. Fracture of right side orbit, fracture of left parietal bone and left temporal bone. The Doctor also noted the following Internal Injuries:- 1. Brain parenchyma laceration. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died of Neurogenic shock due to Head injury. 11. It is already decided the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of RW1. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only because of the injuries sustained in the accident. Hence, the Respondent is liable to pay compensation to the claimants. 5 AGE 12. The Ex.P7 is the School Transfer certificate and wherein the date of birth of deceased was mentioned as 5.6.1981 and it proved the age of deceased was 33 years at the time of accident. No other contra evidence was supplied by Respondent and hence the age of deceased fixed to 33 years at the time of accident. INCOME 13. The petitioners claimed Rs.20,00,000/- as compensation. It is stated the deceased was working as a Civil contractor building construction at the time of accident and earned Rs.50,000/- per month. The petitioners not produced documentary evidence to prove the occupation of deceased. The P.W.3 examined to prove the occupation and income of the deceased. The P.W.3 deposed that the deceased known to him and he was doing Civil contract work for 5 years and he has entrusted his own house for construction work on contact basis and the deceased constructed house measuring 4 sq.mt for Rs. 5,00,000/- and he started construction work in the month of October, 2013 and finished the construction work in the month of December, 2013. The P.W.3 evidence proved the deceased was working as Civil construction Contractor. But, there was no sufficient proof for the income of Rs. 50,000/- was earned by the deceased. However, considering the deceased was doing Civil contract work, it is opinion of this Tribunal that the deceased could have earn not less than Rs. 15,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 14. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. The deceased was un-organised sector and not get standard income and hence as per the recent decision reported in Chikkamma & another -Vs- Paravathamma & another, in C.A.No. 3409/2017, dated 28.2.2017, being the deceased was under unorganized sectors the concept of future prospects not applicable for this case. Deductions: 15. The deceased was married person at the time of accident and there are 3 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma 6 & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/3rd of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/3rd deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs.15,000 – 5,000 = Rs. 10,000/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 16. Considering the age of the deceased was 33 years at the time of accident and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 16 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore the compensation calculated to Rs.10,000 x12x16= Rs.19,20,000/- and therefore the “ Loss of Dependency to the Family” calculated to Rs. 19,20,000/-. COMPENSATION FOR CONSORTIUM AND LOVE AND AFFECTION CONSORTIUM 17. The petitioners claimed Rs. 1,75,000/- towards loss of consortium. In Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2009 (2) TN MAC 36 (SC) and followed in Shashikala & another -Vs- Gangalakshmamana & another , 2015 (1) TN MAC 785 (SC) it has held that “Loss of consortium is usually for loss for spouse’s affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations for future years and in such circumstances, Courts to award at least Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation for Loss of Consortium” and this position followed in Reliance General Insurance Co Ltd -Vs-K.Meena & others, 2015 (2) TNMAC 449 . The 1st petitioner is wife and aged about 27 years at the time of the accident, which is the crucial period, at which time she very needed the companionship of her husband and for which Rs.1,00,000/- is awarded. Loss of Love & affection & Mental Agony and loss of Expectancy of life : 18. In Asha Verman -Vs- Maharaj Singh, 2015(1) TN MAC 465 (SC), it is held in para 18, that each children entitled at Rs. 1,00,000/- towards love and affection and each parents are entitled at Rs. 50,000/-. The petitioners 2 and 3 are the Minor daughters of the deceased and they have lost their love & affection of the deceased and it is not measurable by money. However, a small amount of Rs.1,00,000/- is considered in the lumpsum calculation towards love and affection. Funeral Expenses : 19. Decent burial is also one on the right under Art 21 of our constitution, The petitioners have failed to produce any expenditure statement relating to the funeral 7 expenses, so the tribunal has awarded a minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- for the head, also relied the Judgment in Rajesh v. Rajbir singh [CDJ 2013 SC 485], the Hon’ble apex court has further held that “ Funeral expenses not only includes fee paid in crematorium or cementary but also includes religious practices and conventions performed on death in family. Hence in absence of any evidence to contrary, minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- to be awarded by Courts towards funeral expenses ”. Hence, a sum of Rs,25,000/- alone was considered and fixed the award in lumpsum manner. Loss of Estate, Transport Expenses and damages for articles:- 20. This Tribunal not considered future prospects and hence t his Tribunal awarded Rs. 50,000/- towards loss of estate. The petitioner not produced any documentary evidence showing the actual expenses for transport expenses. However, this Tribunal awarded Rs. 5000/- towards transport expenses. The petitioners not accounted for the actual damages caused in accident. Hence, this Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs. 2000/- towards damage to clothes and articles. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 19,20,000 2.Loss of consortium ...Rs. 1,00,000 3.Loss of Love & Affection …Rs. 1,00,000 4.Loss of estate ...Rs 50,000 5.Funeral expenses ...Rs. 25,000 6.Transport expenses ...Rs. 5,000 7.Damages to cloths and articles ...Rs. 2,000 ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 22,02,000 ------------------------- 21. The petitioners claimed compensation of Rs. 20,00,000/-. But the calculation of compensation exceeds the claim made by the petitioners. In Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 ACJ 1403, the Full bench of the Hon’ble Apex Court has held that tribunal has the power for compensation in excess of claim. It has further held that “ The Courts have to attempt to equate misery suffered by injured/ dependants of the deceased with compensation so that injured/ dependants do not suffer hardship in life on account of loss of income earned by the victim. The courts have to ignore the technicalities and niceties in process”. This court followed the above legal position and even though the petitoners claimed Rs. 20,00,000/- as compensation, as per the above calculation awarded Rs. 22,02,000/- as total compensation to the petitioners. 8 22. In the result, this petition is partly allowed with costs and the petitioners are entitled for Rs. 22,02,000/- (Rupees Twenty Two Lakhs and Two Thousand only) as compensation. The respondent is directed to pay and deposit the award amount into this court within 4 weeks from this day with interest at 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this petition (15.9.2015) till the date of deposit. The respondent is directed to deposit the award amount through NEFT or RTGE mode in the account of FIRST ADDITIONAL DISTRICT COURT, MACT, Vellore in Account No. 35965368047 (IFSC Code SBIN0008688) of SBI, Sathuvachari Branch, Vellore, under intimation to this court ad claimants. The 1st petitioner who is the wife of the deceased is entitled to get Rs.10,00,000/- from the above award amount. The Minor petitioners 2 and 3 are entitled to share the remaining award amount equally. In the first instance, the 1st petitioner is ordered to receive 50% along with entire interest accrued thereupon on it and costs; The remaining share of the petitioners is ordered to be deposited in any one of the nationalized Bank for a period of not less than three years.

Ramanathan, Advocate for the 2nd respondent and the 1st Respondent remain absent and set exparte and on hearing the arguments of both side and upon perusing the case records, written argument and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court delivered the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 3. Name of deceased person : Dayalan 4. Age of the deceased person : 28 years 5. Occupation : Electrician & Agriculturist 6. Income pleaded : Rs.25,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 20.04.2015 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.25,00,000/- 2 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the wife, daughter and parents of the deceased Dayalan who died in a road accident. That on 20.04.2015 at about 2.20 P.M. while the deceased was riding the motor cycle Hero Honda Splendor bearing Reg.No. TN-25-AY-7936 on the left side of the road, on Arni to Arcot road, opposite to ACS Arts College, at that time, the 1st respondent's two wheeler TVS XL Super bearing Reg.No. TN-25 R 1694, ridden by one Gopalakrishnan, came rashly and negligently in the wrong side and dashed the two wheeler ridden by the deceased Dayalan and as a result of which, the deceased sustained multiple injuries on his head and face. Immediately, he was taken to the Government Hospital, Arni for treatment and then shifted to the Government Vellore Medical College Hospital, for further management. But, unfortunately he died on the same day at about 06.30 P.M., Arni Taluk Police have registered a case in Crime No. 107/2015 u/s. 279, 337 and 304(A) of IPC against the rider of the two wheeler - TN 25 R 1694. Prior to the accident the deceased was hale and healthy and he was working as an electrician and also he was an agriculturist and thereby earned Rs.25,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs.25,00,000/- for the death of Dayalan as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER OF 1st RESPONDENT:- The petition is not sustainable in law and on facts. The allegations made in the petition are denied except those that are admitted. The age, income and occupation of the deceased are denied. The place, date, time and manner of accident are not admitted. The alleged nature of injuries of deceased are denied. It is denied that the death was due to alleged nature of injuries. It is not true that the accident was due to rash and negligent riding of the rider of the 1st respondent's two wheeler bearing registration No. TN-25 R 1694. In fact, the alleged accident was solely due to the fault of the deceased Dayalan as he had ridden the two wheeler rashly and negligently and dashed against the 1st respondent's motorcycle. As a result of which, the rider of the 1st respondent's motorcycle died on the spot itself. Further the petitioners have not impleaded the insurer of the two wheeler ridden by the deceased Dayalan and hence, the petition is bad for non joinder of necessary parties. This respondent is not liable to compensate the petitioners. The amount claimed is excessive. At the time of accident, the 1st respondent's vehicle was insured with he 2nd respondent and the policy was in force. Hence, the petition is liable to be dismissed as far as the 1st respondent is concerned. 3 4. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER OF 2ND RESPONDENT:- The petition is not sustainable in law and on facts. The allegations made in the petition are denied except those that are admitted. The allegations regarding the age, income and occupation of the deceased are denied. The two wheeler ridden by the deceased Dayalan was not insured with any Insurance company. It is denied that the rider of the two wheeler TVS XL bearing No.TN 25 R 1694 was negligent and came on the wrong side of the road and caused the accident. The deceased Dayalan has ridden his two wheeler in a rash and negligent manner and hit against the TVS XL 50 vehicle and caused the death of its rider Gopalakrishnan and also caused injuries to the pillion rider Sathya. Hence, the 2nd respondent is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. The legal heirs of the deceased Gopalakrishnan have filed MCOP No.185/2015 on the file of Sub Court, Arni claiming compensation and the same is pending. The injured pillion rider Sathya had also filed MCOP on the file of Sub Court, Arni, claiming compensation. The amount claimed as compensation is highly excessive. Hence, the peition is liable to be dismissed. 4. The Points : 1.Who is responsible for the accident? 2.Whether the respondents are liable to pay compensation? If so, which respondent is liable? 3.Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner Latha was examined as PW1. One Ramarajan was examined as PW2. Mr.M. Ravichandran, S.S.I., Arni was examined as P.W.3. Ex.P1 to P10 were marked on the side of the petitioners. On the side of respondents, no witness was examined and no document was marked as exhibit. The 2nd respondent has filed a petition in IA No. 896/2017 u/s 170 M.V. Act and the same was allowed on 21.09.2017. POINT NO.1: 6. It is the case of the petitioners that on 20.04.2015 at about 2.20 P.M. while the deceased Dayalan was riding the motor cycle Hero Honda Splendor bearing Reg.No. TN- 25-AY-7936 on the left side of the road, on Arni to Arcot road, opposite to ACS Arts College, at that time, the 1st respondent's two wheeler TVS XL Super bearing Reg.No. TN- 25 R 1694, ridden by one Gopalakrishnan, came rashly and negligently in the wrong side 4 and dashed the two wheeler ridden by the deceased Dayalan and as a result of which, the deceased sustained multiple injuries on his head and face and then succumbed to the injuries at about 06.30 P.M., in the Government Vellore Medical College Hospital. But the 2nd respondent denied the manner of the accident and contended that t he accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent riding of the two wheeler by the deceased. Since, the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident as pleaded by the claimants we have to decide whether the 1st Respondent's driver is responsible for the accident and there was any contributory negligence on the part of deceased. 7. PW1 deposed that the accident was happened due the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent driver. She had admitted in the cross examination that she had not seen the accident directly. PW2 Ramarajan is the occurrence witness and he deposed that on 20.04.2015, he had handed over the electric motor in the repair shop which is situated opposite to ACS Arts College on Arni to Aroct road and while he was speaking with a person near the welding shop, the deceased Dayalan came from South to North by riding his two wheeler TN 25 AY 7636 and at the same time, another two wheeler namely TNS XL Super bearing No. TN 25 R 1694 came from the College Gate and its rider has ridden the said vehicle by talking with the pillion rider and the said vehicle dashed the two wheeler of the deceased Dayalan and caused the accident. He has confirmed in the cross examination that the said Dayalan rode his two wheeler in a slow manner and that the accident took place only due to the rider of the two wheeler who came from college gate by speaking with the person on the pillion. 8. The accident was reported before the Arni Taluk Police by PW1, and the police have registered a case in Crime No. 107/2015 u/s. 279, 337 and 304(A) of IPC against the rider of the 1st respondent's vehicle. The copy of FIR is marked as Ex.P1 and wherein it is stated the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent driver. Though the counsel for the 2nd respondent contended that the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of the two wheeler by the deceased Dayalan, no oral or documentary evidence was let in on their side. On receipt of Court summon, Mr.M. Ravichandran, Special Sub Inspector of Police, Arni appeared before this tribunal and examined as P.W.3. In his evidence he has stated that since the accused Gopalakrishnan died, further action was dropped in the criminal case. He has marked the referred charge sheet as Ex.P9 and Rough Sketch as Ex.P10 respectively. 5 Absolutely, there is no evidence on record to prove that the deceased Dayalan has caused the accident by his rash and negligent riding. P.W.2 has clearly spoken that the negligent act of the driver of the 1st respondent's vehicle was the main cause for the accident. Hence, it is decided the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. The 1st respondent, owner of the vehicle is vicariously liable for the negligent act of his driver. As per Ex.P8, the offending two wheeler was insured with the 2nd respondent insurance company and the policy was in force at the time of accident. Therefore, the 2nd respondent is liable to compensate the petitioners and these points are answered accordingly. POINT No.3: 9. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that only because of the accident, the deceased Dayalan, young man, aged 28 years lost his life and that the petitioners who are the dependents of the deceased lost their only bread winner of the family and that for computing the quantum of compensation, the rulings reported in the following cases may be considered: 1. 2013(2) TNMAC 55 (SC) - Rajesh & others -vs- Rajbir Singh & Others 2. 2016(2) TNMAC 611 (DB) - Managing Director, TNSTC., Kanchipuram -vs- Thahira and others. 3. 2017(2) TNMAC 609 (SC) - National Insurance Company Limited -vs- Pranay Sethi and Others. In this case, the 1st petitioner is the wife, 2nd petitioner is the daughter and the petitioners No.3 and 4 are the parents of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P5 legal heir certificate. HELMET 10. The 2nd Respondent counsel argued the deceased not wear the helmet at the time of accident and hence there was violation of MV. Rules by the deceased and hence the claimants not entitled for compensation. The Doctor noted the injuries on the scalp in Ex.P.2 postmortem certificate. P.W.2 also admitted the deceased was died due to head injury. If the deceased wear helmet, the death could have been avoided and there is every chance to save the life of the deceased. It is not proper to decline the compensation to the claimants for the reason that the deceased not wear the helmet. Considering the deceased not wear helmet, this tribunal fix the responsibility of the deceased at 10%. 6 AGE 11. The petitioners/claimants have filed the Postmortem Certificate, Death Report and Death Certificate and marked the same as Ex.P2, P3 and P4 respectively. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 28 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report the age of deceased was appeared to be 28 years. The original driving licence of the deceased Dayalan was marked as Ex.P6 and E.S.I. card was marked as Ex.P7. Ex.P6 and P7 disclosed that the deceased was born in the year 1989. Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximate age recorded in Ex.P.2 Postmortem Certificate treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 28 years at the time of accident. INCOME 12. The petitioners have claimed Rs. 25,00,000/- as compensation. According to the petitioners, the deceased was working as electrician and also doing agriculture and earned Rs.25,000/- per month. There was no evidence to show the income proof. No document is filed to show that the deceased was earning Rs.25,000/- per month through agriculture or by doing electrical works. The socio-economic condition forced to any individual to earn minimum at the rate of Rs.200/- per day for his living. Considering the age of the deceased, this Tribunal has fixed the notional income of deceased person as Rs.6,500/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 13. Recently the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided in The National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and Others, Special Leave petition (Civil) No. 25590 of 2014 order dated 31.10.2017, that in case of person has self employed on a fixed salary, an additional of 40% of the established income should be the warrant where the deceased was below the age of 40 years. An addition of 25% where the deceased was between the age of 40 to 50 years and 10% where the deceased was between the age of 50 to 60 years should be regarded as the necessary method of computation. Considering the income of the deceased was fixed to Rs. 6,500/-, the annual income of the deceased was Rs. 6,500 x 12 = 78,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased was fixed to 28 years at the time of accident 40% of income added towards future prospects and the monthly income arrived to Rs. 6,500+2600 = Rs.9,100/-. 7 Deductions: 14. There are 4 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/4 of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/4 deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs. 9,100 - 2275 = Rs.6,825/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF DEPENDENCY 15. Considering the age of the deceased is 28 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 17 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, t he “loss of dependency” to the family is arrived to Rs. 6,825/- x 12 x 17 = Rs.13,92,300/- LOVE AND AFFECTION 16. In Asha Verman -Vs- Maharaj Singh, 2015(1) TN MAC 465 (SC), it is held in para 18, that each children entitled at Rs. 1,00,000/- towards love and affection and each parents are entitled at Rs. 50,000/-. The 2 to 4 petitioners are daughter, mother and father of the deceased and they have lost their love & affection of the deceased and it is not measurable by money. However, a small amount of Rs.1,00,000/- is considered in the lumpsum calculation towards love and affection. 20. As per the dictum laid down in The National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and Others, Special Leave petition (Civil) No. 25590 of 2014 order dated 31.10.2017, This tribunal awarded Rs.40,000/- towards loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner, Rs.15,000/- is awarded towards funeral expenses. Apart from this, Rs. 10,000/- is granted towards transport expenses. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 13,92,300/- 2.Loss of Love & Affection …Rs. 1,00,000/- 3.Loss of consortium ...Rs. 40,000/- 4.Funeral expenses ...Rs. 15,000/- 5.Transport expenses ...Rs. 10,000/- ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 15,57,300/- ------------------------- 8 21. It is already decided that since the deceased contributed 10% of negligence to accident, the petitioners has to bear the 10% of compensation. So, the 90% of compensation payable by the 2nd Respondent is arrived to Rs. 14,01,570/- to the claimants. 22. In the result, this petition is partly allowed with costs as against the 2nd respondent and the petitioners are entitled for Rs.14,01,570/- (Rupees Fourteen Lakhs One thousand Five hundred and Seventy only) as compensation being 90% of compensation.

Income pleaded : Rs.25,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 20.04.2015 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.25,00,000/- 2 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the wife, daughter and parents of the deceased Dayalan who died in a road accident. That on 20.04.2015 at about 2.20 P.M. while the deceased was riding the motor cycle Hero Honda Splendor bearing Reg.No. TN-25-AY-7936 on the left side of the road, on Arni to Arcot road, opposite to ACS Arts College, at that time, the 1st respondent's two wheeler TVS XL Super bearing Reg.No. TN-25 R 1694, ridden by one Gopalakrishnan, came rashly and negligently in the wrong side and dashed the two wheeler ridden by the deceased Dayalan and as a result of which, the deceased sustained multiple injuries on his head and face. Immediately, he was taken to the Government Hospital, Arni for treatment and then shifted to the Government Vellore Medical College Hospital, for further management. But, unfortunately he died on the same day at about 06.30 P.M., Arni Taluk Police have registered a case in Crime No. 107/2015 u/s. 279, 337 and 304(A) of IPC against the rider of the two wheeler - TN 25 R 1694. Prior to the accident the deceased was hale and healthy and he was working as an electrician and also he was an agriculturist and thereby earned Rs.25,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs.25,00,000/- for the death of Dayalan as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER OF 1st RESPONDENT:- The petition is not sustainable in law and on facts. The allegations made in the petition are denied except those that are admitted. The age, income and occupation of the deceased are denied. The place, date, time and manner of accident are not admitted. The alleged nature of injuries of deceased are denied. It is denied that the death was due to alleged nature of injuries. It is not true that the accident was due to rash and negligent riding of the rider of the 1st respondent's two wheeler bearing registration No. TN-25 R 1694. In fact, the alleged accident was solely due to the fault of the deceased Dayalan as he had ridden the two wheeler rashly and negligently and dashed against the 1st respondent's motorcycle. As a result of which, the rider of the 1st respondent's motorcycle died on the spot itself. Further the petitioners have not impleaded the insurer of the two wheeler ridden by the deceased Dayalan and hence, the petition is bad for non joinder of necessary parties. This respondent is not liable to compensate the petitioners. The amount claimed is excessive. At the time of accident, the 1st respondent's vehicle was insured with he 2nd respondent and the policy was in force. Hence, the petition is liable to be dismissed as far as the 1st respondent is concerned. 3 4. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER OF 2ND RESPONDENT:- The petition is not sustainable in law and on facts. The allegations made in the petition are denied except those that are admitted. The allegations regarding the age, income and occupation of the deceased are denied. The two wheeler ridden by the deceased Dayalan was not insured with any Insurance company. It is denied that the rider of the two wheeler TVS XL bearing No.TN 25 R 1694 was negligent and came on the wrong side of the road and caused the accident. The deceased Dayalan has ridden his two wheeler in a rash and negligent manner and hit against the TVS XL 50 vehicle and caused the death of its rider Gopalakrishnan and also caused injuries to the pillion rider Sathya. Hence, the 2nd respondent is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. The legal heirs of the deceased Gopalakrishnan have filed MCOP No.185/2015 on the file of Sub Court, Arni claiming compensation and the same is pending. The injured pillion rider Sathya had also filed MCOP on the file of Sub Court, Arni, claiming compensation. The amount claimed as compensation is highly excessive. Hence, the peition is liable to be dismissed. 4. The Points : 1.Who is responsible for the accident? 2.Whether the respondents are liable to pay compensation? If so, which respondent is liable? 3.Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner Latha was examined as PW1. One Ramarajan was examined as PW2. Mr.M. Ravichandran, S.S.I., Arni was examined as P.W.3. Ex.P1 to P10 were marked on the side of the petitioners. On the side of respondents, no witness was examined and no document was marked as exhibit. The 2nd respondent has filed a petition in IA No. 896/2017 u/s 170 M.V. Act and the same was allowed on 21.09.2017. POINT NO.1: 6. It is the case of the petitioners that on 20.04.2015 at about 2.20 P.M. while the deceased Dayalan was riding the motor cycle Hero Honda Splendor bearing Reg.No. TN- 25-AY-7936 on the left side of the road, on Arni to Arcot road, opposite to ACS Arts College, at that time, the 1st respondent's two wheeler TVS XL Super bearing Reg.No. TN- 25 R 1694, ridden by one Gopalakrishnan, came rashly and negligently in the wrong side 4 and dashed the two wheeler ridden by the deceased Dayalan and as a result of which, the deceased sustained multiple injuries on his head and face and then succumbed to the injuries at about 06.30 P.M., in the Government Vellore Medical College Hospital. But the 2nd respondent denied the manner of the accident and contended that t he accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent riding of the two wheeler by the deceased. Since, the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident as pleaded by the claimants we have to decide whether the 1st Respondent's driver is responsible for the accident and there was any contributory negligence on the part of deceased. 7. PW1 deposed that the accident was happened due the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent driver. She had admitted in the cross examination that she had not seen the accident directly.

The copy of FIR is marked as Ex.P1 and wherein it is stated the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent driver. Though the counsel for the 2nd respondent contended that the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of the two wheeler by the deceased Dayalan, no oral or documentary evidence was let in on their side.

In his evidence he has stated that since the accused Gopalakrishnan died, further action was dropped in the criminal case. He has marked the referred charge sheet as Ex.P9 and Rough Sketch as Ex.P10 respectively. 5 Absolutely, there is no evidence on record to prove that the deceased Dayalan has caused the accident by his rash and negligent riding. P.W.2 has clearly spoken that the negligent act of the driver of the 1st respondent's vehicle was the main cause for the accident. Hence, it is decided the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. The 1st respondent, owner of the vehicle is vicariously liable for the negligent act of his driver. As per Ex.P8, the offending two wheeler was insured with the 2nd respondent insurance company and the policy was in force at the time of accident.

THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the wife, daughter and parents of the deceased Dayalan who died in a road accident. That on 20.04.2015 at about 2.20 P.M. while the deceased was riding the motor cycle Hero Honda Splendor bearing Reg.No. TN-25-AY-7936 on the left side of the road, on Arni to Arcot road, opposite to ACS Arts College, at that time, the 1st respondent's two wheeler TVS XL Super bearing Reg.No. TN-25 R 1694, ridden by one Gopalakrishnan, came rashly and negligently in the wrong side and dashed the two wheeler ridden by the deceased Dayalan and as a result of which, the deceased sustained multiple injuries on his head and face. Immediately, he was taken to the Government Hospital, Arni for treatment and then shifted to the Government Vellore Medical College Hospital, for further management. But, unfortunately he died on the same day at about 06.30 P.M., Arni Taluk Police have registered a case in Crime No. 107/2015 u/s. 279, 337 and 304(A) of IPC against the rider of the two wheeler - TN 25 R 1694. Prior to the accident the deceased was hale and healthy and he was working as an electrician and also he was an agriculturist and thereby earned Rs.25,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs.25,00,000/- for the death of Dayalan as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER OF 1st RESPONDENT:- The petition is not sustainable in law and on facts. The allegations made in the petition are denied except those that are admitted. The age, income and occupation of the deceased are denied. The place, date, time and manner of accident are not admitted. The alleged nature of injuries of deceased are denied. It is denied that the death was due to alleged nature of injuries. It is not true that the accident was due to rash and negligent riding of the rider of the 1st respondent's two wheeler bearing registration No. TN-25 R 1694. In fact, the alleged accident was solely due to the fault of the deceased Dayalan as he had ridden the two wheeler rashly and negligently and dashed against the 1st respondent's motorcycle. As a result of which, the rider of the 1st respondent's motorcycle died on the spot itself. Further the petitioners have not impleaded the insurer of the two wheeler ridden by the deceased Dayalan and hence, the petition is bad for non joinder of necessary parties. This respondent is not liable to compensate the petitioners. The amount claimed is excessive. At the time of accident, the 1st respondent's vehicle was insured with he 2nd respondent and the policy was in force. Hence, the petition is liable to be dismissed as far as the 1st respondent is concerned. 3 4. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER OF 2ND RESPONDENT:- The petition is not sustainable in law and on facts. The allegations made in the petition are denied except those that are admitted. The allegations regarding the age, income and occupation of the deceased are denied. The two wheeler ridden by the deceased Dayalan was not insured with any Insurance company. It is denied that the rider of the two wheeler TVS XL bearing No.TN 25 R 1694 was negligent and came on the wrong side of the road and caused the accident. The deceased Dayalan has ridden his two wheeler in a rash and negligent manner and hit against the TVS XL 50 vehicle and caused the death of its rider Gopalakrishnan and also caused injuries to the pillion rider Sathya. Hence, the 2nd respondent is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. The legal heirs of the deceased Gopalakrishnan have filed MCOP No.185/2015 on the file of Sub Court, Arni claiming compensation and the same is pending. The injured pillion rider Sathya had also filed MCOP on the file of Sub Court, Arni, claiming compensation. The amount claimed as compensation is highly excessive. Hence, the peition is liable to be dismissed. 4. The Points : 1.Who is responsible for the accident? 2.Whether the respondents are liable to pay compensation? If so, which respondent is liable? 3.Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner Latha was examined as PW1. One Ramarajan was examined as PW2. Mr.M. Ravichandran, S.S.I., Arni was examined as P.W.3. Ex.P1 to P10 were marked on the side of the petitioners. On the side of respondents, no witness was examined and no document was marked as exhibit. The 2nd respondent has filed a petition in IA No. 896/2017 u/s 170 M.V. Act and the same was allowed on 21.09.2017. POINT NO.1: 6. It is the case of the petitioners that on 20.04.2015 at about 2.20 P.M. while the deceased Dayalan was riding the motor cycle Hero Honda Splendor bearing Reg.No. TN- 25-AY-7936 on the left side of the road, on Arni to Arcot road, opposite to ACS Arts College, at that time, the 1st respondent's two wheeler TVS XL Super bearing Reg.No. TN- 25 R 1694, ridden by one Gopalakrishnan, came rashly and negligently in the wrong side 4 and dashed the two wheeler ridden by the deceased Dayalan and as a result of which, the deceased sustained multiple injuries on his head and face and then succumbed to the injuries at about 06.30 P.M., in the Government Vellore Medical College Hospital. But the 2nd respondent denied the manner of the accident and contended that t he accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent riding of the two wheeler by the deceased. Since, the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident as pleaded by the claimants we have to decide whether the 1st Respondent's driver is responsible for the accident and there was any contributory negligence on the part of deceased. 7. PW1 deposed that the accident was happened due the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent driver. She had admitted in the cross examination that she had not seen the accident directly. PW2 Ramarajan is the occurrence witness and he deposed that on 20.04.2015, he had handed over the electric motor in the repair shop which is situated opposite to ACS Arts College on Arni to Aroct road and while he was speaking with a person near the welding shop, the deceased Dayalan came from South to North by riding his two wheeler TN 25 AY 7636 and at the same time, another two wheeler namely TNS XL Super bearing No. TN 25 R 1694 came from the College Gate and its rider has ridden the said vehicle by talking with the pillion rider and the said vehicle dashed the two wheeler of the deceased Dayalan and caused the accident. He has confirmed in the cross examination that the said Dayalan rode his two wheeler in a slow manner and that the accident took place only due to the rider of the two wheeler who came from college gate by speaking with the person on the pillion. 8. The accident was reported before the Arni Taluk Police by PW1, and the police have registered a case in Crime No. 107/2015 u/s. 279, 337 and 304(A) of IPC against the rider of the 1st respondent's vehicle. The copy of FIR is marked as Ex.P1 and wherein it is stated the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent driver. Though the counsel for the 2nd respondent contended that the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of the two wheeler by the deceased Dayalan, no oral or documentary evidence was let in on their side. On receipt of Court summon, Mr.M. Ravichandran, Special Sub Inspector of Police, Arni appeared before this tribunal and examined as P.W.3. In his evidence he has stated that since the accused Gopalakrishnan died, further action was dropped in the criminal case. He has marked the referred charge sheet as Ex.P9 and Rough Sketch as Ex.P10 respectively. 5 Absolutely, there is no evidence on record to prove that the deceased Dayalan has caused the accident by his rash and negligent riding. P.W.2 has clearly spoken that the negligent act of the driver of the 1st respondent's vehicle was the main cause for the accident. Hence, it is decided the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. The 1st respondent, owner of the vehicle is vicariously liable for the negligent act of his driver. As per Ex.P8, the offending two wheeler was insured with the 2nd respondent insurance company and the policy was in force at the time of accident. Therefore, the 2nd respondent is liable to compensate the petitioners and these points are answered accordingly. POINT No.3: 9. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that only because of the accident, the deceased Dayalan, young man, aged 28 years lost his life and that the petitioners who are the dependents of the deceased lost their only bread winner of the family and that for computing the quantum of compensation, the rulings reported in the following cases may be considered: 1. 2013(2) TNMAC 55 (SC) - Rajesh & others -vs- Rajbir Singh & Others 2. 2016(2) TNMAC 611 (DB) - Managing Director, TNSTC., Kanchipuram -vs- Thahira and others. 3. 2017(2) TNMAC 609 (SC) - National Insurance Company Limited -vs- Pranay Sethi and Others. In this case, the 1st petitioner is the wife, 2nd petitioner is the daughter and the petitioners No.3 and 4 are the parents of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P5 legal heir certificate. HELMET 10. The 2nd Respondent counsel argued the deceased not wear the helmet at the time of accident and hence there was violation of MV. Rules by the deceased and hence the claimants not entitled for compensation. The Doctor noted the injuries on the scalp in Ex.P.2 postmortem certificate. P.W.2 also admitted the deceased was died due to head injury. If the deceased wear helmet, the death could have been avoided and there is every chance to save the life of the deceased. It is not proper to decline the compensation to the claimants for the reason that the deceased not wear the helmet. Considering the deceased not wear helmet, this tribunal fix the responsibility of the deceased at 10%. 6 AGE 11. The petitioners/claimants have filed the Postmortem Certificate, Death Report and Death Certificate and marked the same as Ex.P2, P3 and P4 respectively. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 28 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report the age of deceased was appeared to be 28 years. The original driving licence of the deceased Dayalan was marked as Ex.P6 and E.S.I. card was marked as Ex.P7. Ex.P6 and P7 disclosed that the deceased was born in the year 1989. Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximate age recorded in Ex.P.2 Postmortem Certificate treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 28 years at the time of accident. INCOME 12. The petitioners have claimed Rs. 25,00,000/- as compensation. According to the petitioners, the deceased was working as electrician and also doing agriculture and earned Rs.25,000/- per month. There was no evidence to show the income proof. No document is filed to show that the deceased was earning Rs.25,000/- per month through agriculture or by doing electrical works. The socio-economic condition forced to any individual to earn minimum at the rate of Rs.200/- per day for his living. Considering the age of the deceased, this Tribunal has fixed the notional income of deceased person as Rs.6,500/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 13. Recently the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided in The National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and Others, Special Leave petition (Civil) No. 25590 of 2014 order dated 31.10.2017, that in case of person has self employed on a fixed salary, an additional of 40% of the established income should be the warrant where the deceased was below the age of 40 years. An addition of 25% where the deceased was between the age of 40 to 50 years and 10% where the deceased was between the age of 50 to 60 years should be regarded as the necessary method of computation. Considering the income of the deceased was fixed to Rs. 6,500/-, the annual income of the deceased was Rs. 6,500 x 12 = 78,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased was fixed to 28 years at the time of accident 40% of income added towards future prospects and the monthly income arrived to Rs. 6,500+2600 = Rs.9,100/-. 7 Deductions: 14. There are 4 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/4 of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/4 deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs. 9,100 - 2275 = Rs.6,825/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF DEPENDENCY 15. Considering the age of the deceased is 28 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 17 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, t he “loss of dependency” to the family is arrived to Rs. 6,825/- x 12 x 17 = Rs.13,92,300/- LOVE AND AFFECTION 16. In Asha Verman -Vs- Maharaj Singh, 2015(1) TN MAC 465 (SC), it is held in para 18, that each children entitled at Rs. 1,00,000/- towards love and affection and each parents are entitled at Rs. 50,000/-. The 2 to 4 petitioners are daughter, mother and father of the deceased and they have lost their love & affection of the deceased and it is not measurable by money. However, a small amount of Rs.1,00,000/- is considered in the lumpsum calculation towards love and affection. 20. As per the dictum laid down in The National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and Others, Special Leave petition (Civil) No. 25590 of 2014 order dated 31.10.2017, This tribunal awarded Rs.40,000/- towards loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner, Rs.15,000/- is awarded towards funeral expenses. Apart from this, Rs. 10,000/- is granted towards transport expenses. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 13,92,300/- 2.Loss of Love & Affection …Rs. 1,00,000/- 3.Loss of consortium ...Rs. 40,000/- 4.Funeral expenses ...Rs. 15,000/- 5.Transport expenses ...Rs. 10,000/- ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 15,57,300/- ------------------------- 8 21. It is already decided that since the deceased contributed 10% of negligence to accident, the petitioners has to bear the 10% of compensation. So, the 90% of compensation payable by the 2nd Respondent is arrived to Rs. 14,01,570/- to the claimants. 22. In the result, this petition is partly allowed with costs as against the 2nd respondent and the petitioners are entitled for Rs.14,01,570/- (Rupees Fourteen Lakhs One thousand Five hundred and Seventy only) as compensation being 90% of compensation. The 2nd respondent is directed to pay and deposit the above award amount into this court within 4 weeks from this day with interest at 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this petition (24.06.2015) till the date of deposit, excluding the period of default if any. The 2nd respondent is directed to deposit the said award amount through NEFT or RTGE mode in the account of FIRST ADDITIONAL DISTRICT COURT, MACT, Vellore in Account No. 35965368047 (IFSC Code SBIN0008688) of SBI, Sathuvachari Branch, Vellore, under intimation to this court and claimants. The 1st petitioner who is the wife of the deceased entitled to get Rs.4,01,570/-, the 2nd petitioner who is the minor child of the deceased is entitled to get Rs.5,50,000/- and the 3rd and 4th petitioners, the parents of the deceased are each entitled to get Rs.2,25,000/- from the above award amount.

The accident was reported before the Arni Taluk Police by PW1, and the police have registered a case in Crime No. 107/2015 u/s. 279, 337 and 304(A) of IPC against the rider of the 1st respondent's vehicle. The copy of FIR is marked as Ex.P1 and wherein it is stated the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent driver. Though the counsel for the 2nd respondent contended that the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of the two wheeler by the deceased Dayalan, no oral or documentary evidence was let in on their side. On receipt of Court summon, Mr.M. Ravichandran, Special Sub Inspector of Police, Arni appeared before this tribunal and examined as P.W.3. In his evidence he has stated that since the accused Gopalakrishnan died, further action was dropped in the criminal case. He has marked the referred charge sheet as Ex.P9 and Rough Sketch as Ex.P10 respectively. 5 Absolutely, there is no evidence on record to prove that the deceased Dayalan has caused the accident by his rash and negligent riding. P.W.2 has clearly spoken that the negligent act of the driver of the 1st respondent's vehicle was the main cause for the accident. Hence, it is decided the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. The 1st respondent, owner of the vehicle is vicariously liable for the negligent act of his driver. As per Ex.P8, the offending two wheeler was insured with the 2nd respondent insurance company and the policy was in force at the time of accident. Therefore, the 2nd respondent is liable to compensate the petitioners and these points are answered accordingly. POINT No.3: 9. The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that only because of the accident, the deceased Dayalan, young man, aged 28 years lost his life and that the petitioners who are the dependents of the deceased lost their only bread winner of the family and that for computing the quantum of compensation, the rulings reported in the following cases may be considered: 1. 2013(2) TNMAC 55 (SC) - Rajesh & others -vs- Rajbir Singh & Others 2. 2016(2) TNMAC 611 (DB) - Managing Director, TNSTC., Kanchipuram -vs- Thahira and others. 3. 2017(2) TNMAC 609 (SC) - National Insurance Company Limited -vs- Pranay Sethi and Others. In this case, the 1st petitioner is the wife, 2nd petitioner is the daughter and the petitioners No.3 and 4 are the parents of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P5 legal heir certificate. HELMET 10. The 2nd Respondent counsel argued the deceased not wear the helmet at the time of accident and hence there was violation of MV. Rules by the deceased and hence the claimants not entitled for compensation. The Doctor noted the injuries on the scalp in Ex.P.2 postmortem certificate. P.W.2 also admitted the deceased was died due to head injury. If the deceased wear helmet, the death could have been avoided and there is every chance to save the life of the deceased. It is not proper to decline the compensation to the claimants for the reason that the deceased not wear the helmet. Considering the deceased not wear helmet, this tribunal fix the responsibility of the deceased at 10%. 6 AGE 11. The petitioners/claimants have filed the Postmortem Certificate, Death Report and Death Certificate and marked the same as Ex.P2, P3 and P4 respectively. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 28 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report the age of deceased was appeared to be 28 years. The original driving licence of the deceased Dayalan was marked as Ex.P6 and E.S.I. card was marked as Ex.P7. Ex.P6 and P7 disclosed that the deceased was born in the year 1989. Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximate age recorded in Ex.P.2 Postmortem Certificate treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 28 years at the time of accident. INCOME 12. The petitioners have claimed Rs. 25,00,000/- as compensation. According to the petitioners, the deceased was working as electrician and also doing agriculture and earned Rs.25,000/- per month. There was no evidence to show the income proof. No document is filed to show that the deceased was earning Rs.25,000/- per month through agriculture or by doing electrical works. The socio-economic condition forced to any individual to earn minimum at the rate of Rs.200/- per day for his living. Considering the age of the deceased, this Tribunal has fixed the notional income of deceased person as Rs.6,500/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 13. Recently the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided in The National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and Others, Special Leave petition (Civil) No. 25590 of 2014 order dated 31.10.2017, that in case of person has self employed on a fixed salary, an additional of 40% of the established income should be the warrant where the deceased was below the age of 40 years. An addition of 25% where the deceased was between the age of 40 to 50 years and 10% where the deceased was between the age of 50 to 60 years should be regarded as the necessary method of computation. Considering the income of the deceased was fixed to Rs. 6,500/-, the annual income of the deceased was Rs. 6,500 x 12 = 78,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased was fixed to 28 years at the time of accident 40% of income added towards future prospects and the monthly income arrived to Rs. 6,500+2600 = Rs.9,100/-. 7 Deductions: 14. There are 4 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/4 of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/4 deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs. 9,100 - 2275 = Rs.6,825/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF DEPENDENCY 15. Considering the age of the deceased is 28 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 17 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, t he “loss of dependency” to the family is arrived to Rs. 6,825/- x 12 x 17 = Rs.13,92,300/- LOVE AND AFFECTION 16. In Asha Verman -Vs- Maharaj Singh, 2015(1) TN MAC 465 (SC), it is held in para 18, that each children entitled at Rs. 1,00,000/- towards love and affection and each parents are entitled at Rs. 50,000/-. The 2 to 4 petitioners are daughter, mother and father of the deceased and they have lost their love & affection of the deceased and it is not measurable by money. However, a small amount of Rs.1,00,000/- is considered in the lumpsum calculation towards love and affection. 20. As per the dictum laid down in The National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and Others, Special Leave petition (Civil) No. 25590 of 2014 order dated 31.10.2017, This tribunal awarded Rs.40,000/- towards loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner, Rs.15,000/- is awarded towards funeral expenses.

Rs. 15,57,300/- ------------------------- 8 21. It is already decided that since the deceased contributed 10% of negligence to accident, the petitioners has to bear the 10% of compensation. So, the 90% of compensation payable by the 2nd Respondent is arrived to Rs. 14,01,570/- to the claimants. 22.

Income pleaded : Rs.25,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 20.04.2015 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.25,00,000/- 2 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the wife, daughter and parents of the deceased Dayalan who died in a road accident. That on 20.04.2015 at about 2.20 P.M. while the deceased was riding the motor cycle Hero Honda Splendor bearing Reg.No. TN-25-AY-7936 on the left side of the road, on Arni to Arcot road, opposite to ACS Arts College, at that time, the 1st respondent's two wheeler TVS XL Super bearing Reg.No. TN-25 R 1694, ridden by one Gopalakrishnan, came rashly and negligently in the wrong side and dashed the two wheeler ridden by the deceased Dayalan and as a result of which, the deceased sustained multiple injuries on his head and face. Immediately, he was taken to the Government Hospital, Arni for treatment and then shifted to the Government Vellore Medical College Hospital, for further management. But, unfortunately he died on the same day at about 06.30 P.M., Arni Taluk Police have registered a case in Crime No. 107/2015 u/s. 279, 337 and 304(A) of IPC against the rider of the two wheeler - TN 25 R 1694. Prior to the accident the deceased was hale and healthy and he was working as an electrician and also he was an agriculturist and thereby earned Rs.25,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs.25,00,000/- for the death of Dayalan as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER OF 1st RESPONDENT:- The petition is not sustainable in law and on facts. The allegations made in the petition are denied except those that are admitted. The age, income and occupation of the deceased are denied. The place, date, time and manner of accident are not admitted. The alleged nature of injuries of deceased are denied. It is denied that the death was due to alleged nature of injuries. It is not true that the accident was due to rash and negligent riding of the rider of the 1st respondent's two wheeler bearing registration No. TN-25 R 1694. In fact, the alleged accident was solely due to the fault of the deceased Dayalan as he had ridden the two wheeler rashly and negligently and dashed against the 1st respondent's motorcycle. As a result of which, the rider of the 1st respondent's motorcycle died on the spot itself. Further the petitioners have not impleaded the insurer of the two wheeler ridden by the deceased Dayalan and hence, the petition is bad for non joinder of necessary parties. This respondent is not liable to compensate the petitioners. The amount claimed is excessive. At the time of accident, the 1st respondent's vehicle was insured with he 2nd respondent and the policy was in force. Hence, the petition is liable to be dismissed as far as the 1st respondent is concerned. 3 4. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER OF 2ND RESPONDENT:- The petition is not sustainable in law and on facts. The allegations made in the petition are denied except those that are admitted. The allegations regarding the age, income and occupation of the deceased are denied. The two wheeler ridden by the deceased Dayalan was not insured with any Insurance company. It is denied that the rider of the two wheeler TVS XL bearing No.TN 25 R 1694 was negligent and came on the wrong side of the road and caused the accident. The deceased Dayalan has ridden his two wheeler in a rash and negligent manner and hit against the TVS XL 50 vehicle and caused the death of its rider Gopalakrishnan and also caused injuries to the pillion rider Sathya. Hence, the 2nd respondent is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. The legal heirs of the deceased Gopalakrishnan have filed MCOP No.185/2015 on the file of Sub Court, Arni claiming compensation and the same is pending. The injured pillion rider Sathya had also filed MCOP on the file of Sub Court, Arni, claiming compensation. The amount claimed as compensation is highly excessive. Hence, the peition is liable to be dismissed. 4. The Points : 1.Who is responsible for the accident? 2.Whether the respondents are liable to pay compensation? If so, which respondent is liable? 3.Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner Latha was examined as PW1. One Ramarajan was examined as PW2. Mr.M. Ravichandran, S.S.I., Arni was examined as P.W.3. Ex.P1 to P10 were marked on the side of the petitioners. On the side of respondents, no witness was examined and no document was marked as exhibit. The 2nd respondent has filed a petition in IA No. 896/2017 u/s 170 M.V. Act and the same was allowed on 21.09.2017. POINT NO.1: 6. It is the case of the petitioners that on 20.04.2015 at about 2.20 P.M. while the deceased Dayalan was riding the motor cycle Hero Honda Splendor bearing Reg.No. TN- 25-AY-7936 on the left side of the road, on Arni to Arcot road, opposite to ACS Arts College, at that time, the 1st respondent's two wheeler TVS XL Super bearing Reg.No. TN- 25 R 1694, ridden by one Gopalakrishnan, came rashly and negligently in the wrong side 4 and dashed the two wheeler ridden by the deceased Dayalan and as a result of which, the deceased sustained multiple injuries on his head and face and then succumbed to the injuries at about 06.30 P.M., in the Government Vellore Medical College Hospital. But the 2nd respondent denied the manner of the accident and contended that t he accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent riding of the two wheeler by the deceased. Since, the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident as pleaded by the claimants we have to decide whether the 1st Respondent's driver is responsible for the accident and there was any contributory negligence on the part of deceased. 7. PW1 deposed that the accident was happened due the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent driver. She had admitted in the cross examination that she had not seen the accident directly. PW2 Ramarajan is the occurrence witness and he deposed that on 20.04.2015, he had handed over the electric motor in the repair shop which is situated opposite to ACS Arts College on Arni to Aroct road and while he was speaking with a person near the welding shop, the deceased Dayalan came from South to North by riding his two wheeler TN 25 AY 7636 and at the same time, another two wheeler namely TNS XL Super bearing No. TN 25 R 1694 came from the College Gate and its rider has ridden the said vehicle by talking with the pillion rider and the said vehicle dashed the two wheeler of the deceased Dayalan and caused the accident. He has confirmed in the cross examination that the said Dayalan rode his two wheeler in a slow manner and that the accident took place only due to the rider of the two wheeler who came from college gate by speaking with the person on the pillion. 8. The accident was reported before the Arni Taluk Police by PW1, and the police have registered a case in Crime No. 107/2015 u/s. 279, 337 and 304(A) of IPC against the rider of the 1st respondent's vehicle. The copy of FIR is marked as Ex.P1 and wherein it is stated the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent driver.

In his evidence he has stated that since the accused Gopalakrishnan died, further action was dropped in the criminal case. He has marked the referred charge sheet as Ex.P9 and Rough Sketch as Ex.P10 respectively. 5 Absolutely, there is no evidence on record to prove that the deceased Dayalan has caused the accident by his rash and negligent riding. P.W.2 has clearly spoken that the negligent act of the driver of the 1st respondent's vehicle was the main cause for the accident. Hence, it is decided the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. The 1st respondent, owner of the vehicle is vicariously liable for the negligent act of his driver. As per Ex.P8, the offending two wheeler was insured with the 2nd respondent insurance company and the policy was in force at the time of accident.

Raju, counsel for the respondent and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court doth delivereth the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. Name of deceased : Gopi @ Ealumalai 3. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 4. Age of the person dead : 35 years 5. Occupation : Building Contractor 6. Income pleaded : Rs.25,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 04.05.2014 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.15,00,000/- 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the legal heirs of the deceased Gopi @ Elumalai. That on 4.5.2014 at about 6.30 P.M. while 2 the deceased was riding his Bajai Discover two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-23-AM-8311 along with one Palaniyandi as pillion rider on Vellore to Usoor road, Ariyur, near Kalaivani Bore wells, on extreme left side of road, the bus bearing Regn.No. TN-23-N-1677, owned by the respondent was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner towards Vellore from opposite direction and dashed the deceased and as a result of the accident, the deceased sustained grievous injuries all over the body and pillion rider also sustained injuries in the accident and immediately admitted at Government Hospital, Vellore and died due to the injuries sustained in the accident. The Ariyur police have registered a case in Cr. No. 43/2014, u/s. 279, 337, 338 & 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and working as Building contractor and Mason and earned Rs.25,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming compensation of Rs.15,00,000/-. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR THE RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. This Respondent denied the accident. This Respondent's driver drove the bus with due care and caution observing traffic rules and he has not drove the bus in rash and negligent manner at the time of accident. On seeing the rash riding of two wheeler from opposite direction the bus driver stopped the bus. In spite of that the rider of two wheeler coming in rash manner and dashed against the bus. The deceased had no valid driving license and the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent act of the deceased and this claim application is not maintainable for want of Non-Joinder of owner and insurance company of two wheeler and the petitioners not entitled to claim compensation from this Respondent. The petitioners are not dependent of the deceased and not entitled for compensation. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the respondent ? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner and Udayakumar examined as PW1 and PW2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.7 marked. The Respondent's driver Mr. Sankar examined as RW1 and no documents marked for Respondent. 3 POINT NO.1 6. It is admitted fact that the Respondent is the owner of the bus bearing Reg.No. TN-23-N-1677 and R.W.1 was in driver duty on 4.5.2014 at the time of accident. The petitioners contended the accident was happened only due to rash and negligent driving of the R.W.1. But, the Respondent contended the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler by the deceased. The M.V.I inspected the offending bus and issued Ex.P.2 vehicle inspection report and wherein it is mentioned the tyre condition was satisfactory and the breaking system was in order and there was no mechanical defect in the vehicle. Since there was no mechanical defect in the Respondent's vehicle,we have to decide whether the Respondent's driver was responsible for the accident. 7. The 1st petitioner is the wife of the deceased and examined as P.W.1 and she deposed that on 4.5.2014 at about 6.30 P.M, while the deceased riding Bajai Discover two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-23-AM-8311, on Vellore to Usoor road, near Kalaivani Bore wells, the Respondent's driver drove the offending bus in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. The P.W.1 not seen the accident and hence her evidence is not sufficient to prove the accident. 8. The P.W. 2 examined as occurrence witness. The P.W. 2 deposed that on 4.5.2014 at about 6.30 P.M, while the deceased riding Bajai Discover two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-23-AM-8311, at Vellore to Usoor road, near Kalaivani Bore wells, the Respondent's driver drove the offending bus in a rash and negligent manner and coming by deviating the road and dashed against the deceased. The accident was reported to Ariyur police station and they have registered a case in Cr.No.43/2014 for offence u/s 279, 337, 338, 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P1 and wherein it was stated the 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and sustained injuries. 9. The R.W.1 deposed that he has driving the bus in slow and careful manner and the deceased was riding the two wheeler in rash and negligent manner and dashed against the bus. The Ex.P.7 is the rough sketch drawn by Investigation officer and wherein the place of accident was shown on Southern side of the road. At the place of accident the road is double road and the Respondent's bus has to go on Northern side of the road. The 4 Ex.P.7 sketch proved the bus was deviated from its normal way and comes on Southern side and caused the accident and it proved the R.W.1 drove the bus in rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. Hence it is decided the R.W. 1 drove the bus in a rash and negligent manner and caused accident. Point No.2: 10. The 1st petitioner is the wife and 2nd and 3rd petitioners are minor son and daughter of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.5 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.3 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein noted the following External Injuries:- 1. Fracture nasal bone. 2. 4x3 cm grazed abrasion on the centre of jaw. 3. 6x2 cm avulsed laceration on the posterior occipital region. 4. Crush injury seen on left leg 2x3 cm abrasion on the left arm. The Doctor also noted the following Internal Injuries:- 1. There is sub scalpel contusion on the posterior occipital region. 2. There is fracture of the base of skull. 3. There is marked subdural and sub arachinoid haemorrhage on both cerebral hemispheres. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries. 11. It is already decided the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of Respondent's driver. The Ex.P.3 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in the accident. Hence, the Respondent is liable to pay compensation to the claimants. AGE 12. The claimants not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of deceased person. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 35 years. In Ex.P.3 Postmortem report also the approximate age of deceased was recorded as 35 years. Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximate age recorded in Ex.P.3 Postmortem report treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 35 years at the time of accident. 5 INCOME 13. The petitioners claimed Rs.15,00,000/- as compensation. The PW1 deposed that the deceased working as building contractor and Mason worker at the time of the accident and earned Rs. 25,000/- per month and it was not corroborated with documentary proof. The socio-economic condition forced to any individual to earn at the rate of Rs.300/- per day for his living. This court also consider the citation in APSRTC Ltd -Vs- Bharatahy & others, 2015(3) TNLJ 182 (CIVIL), in para 8 it is decided the daily income of carpenter assessed by the Tribunal at Rs. 300/- per day and monthly income of Rs. 9,000/- was not high. In the ruling reported in Managing Director, TNSTC vs Thahira & 3 others, 2016 (2) TNMAC 611 also it is held the notional income fixed by tribunal at Rs. 9,000/- was notexcessive. Considering the above legal position , this Tribunal has fixed the monthly income of deceased person as Rs.9,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 14. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. Recently in a ruling reported in in Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (2) TNMAC 55(SC): 2013 (9) SCC 54 , it was decided future prospects applicable in a case of self-employed persons also. The annual income of the deceased was Rs.9,000x12 = Rs. 1,08,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased was 35 years at the time of accident, 50% of income added towards future prospects and the monthly income arrived to Rs. 9,000 + 4,500 = 13,500/-. Deductions: 15. The deceased was married person at the time of accident. There are 3 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/3rd of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/3rd deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs.13,500 – 4500 - 9000/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 16. Considering the age of the deceased is 35 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 16 is adopted for calculation of 6 compensation. Therefore the compensation calculated to Rs.9000x12x16=Rs.17,28,000/- and therefore the petitioners are entitled Rs. 17,28,000/- as compensation towards loss of income. COMPENSATION FOR CONSORTIUM AND LOVE AND AFFECTION CONSORTIUM 17. In Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2009 (2) TN MAC 36 (SC) and followed in Shashikala & another -Vs- Gangalakshmamana & another , 2015 (1) TN MAC 785 (SC) it has held that “Loss of consortium is usually for loss for spouse’s affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations for future years and in such circumstances, Courts to award at least Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation for Loss of Consortium” and this position followed in Reliance General Insurance Co Ltd -Vs-K.Meena & others, 2015 (2) TNMAC 449 . The 1st petitioner is wife and aged about 29 years at the time of the accident, which is the crucial period, at which time she very needed the companionship of her husband and for which Rs.1,00,000/- is awarded. Loss of Love & affection & Mental Agony and loss of Expectancy of life : 18. In Asha Verman -Vs- Maharaj Singh, 2015(1) TN MAC 465 (SC), it is held in para 18, that each children entitled at Rs. 1,00,000/- towards love and affection and each parents are entitled at Rs. 50,000/-. The petitioners are the wife and children of the deceased and they have lost their love & affection of the deceased and it is not measurable by money. However, a small amount of Rs.1,00,000/- is considered in the lumpsum calculation towards love and affection. Funeral Expenses : 19. Decent burial is also one on the right under Art 21 of our constitution, The petitioner has failed to produced any expenditure statement relating to the funeral expenses, so the tribunal has awarded a minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- for the head, also relied the Judgment in Rajesh v. Rajbir singh [CDJ 2013 SC 485], the Hon’ble apex court has further held that “ Funeral expenses not only includes fee paid in crematorium or cementary but also includes religious practices and conventions performed on death in family. Hence in absence of any evidence to contrary, minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- to be awarded by Courts towards funeral expenses ”. Hence, a sum of Rs,25,000/- alone was considered and fixed the award in lumpsum manner. 7 Loss of Estate, Transport Expenses and damages for articles:- 20. This Tribunal considered future prospects and 50% of income added towards future prospects. Hence, this Tribunal not awarded any under the head of Loss of Estate. The petitioners not produced any documentary evidence showing the actual expenses for transport expenses. However, this Tribunal awarded Rs. 5000/- towards transport expenses. The petitioners not accounted for the actual damages caused in accident. Hence, this Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs. 2000/- towards damage to clothes and articles. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 17,28,000 2.Loss of consortium ...Rs. 1,00,000 3.Loss of Love & Affection …Rs. 1,00,000 4.Loss of estate ...Rs NIL 5.Funeral expenses ...Rs. 25,000 6.Transport expenses ...Rs. 5,000 7.Damages to cloths and articles ...Rs. 2,000 ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 19,60,000 ------------------------- 21. The petitioners claimed compensation of Rs.15,00,000/-. But the calculation of loss of dependency and other benefits exceeds the claim made by the petitioners. In Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 ACJ 1403, the Full bench of the Hon’ble Apex Court has held that tribunal has the power for compensation in excess of claim. It has further held that “ The Courts have to attempt to equate misery suffered by injured/dependants of the deceased with compensation so that injured/dependants do not suffer hardship in life on account of loss of income earned by the victim. The courts have to ignore the technicalities and niceties in process”. This court followed the above legal position and even though the petitioners claimed Rs.15,00,000/- as compensation, this Tribunal awarded Rs. 19,60,000/- as total compensation to the petitioners. 22. In the result, this petition is allowed with costs and the petitioners are entitled for Rs. 19,60,000/- (Rupees Nineteen Lakh Sixty Thousand only) as compensation . The respondent is directed to pay and deposit the award amount into this court within 4 weeks 8 from this day with interest at 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this petition (6.9.2014) till the date of deposit, excluding period of default if any. The respondent is directed to deposit the award amount through NEFT or RTGE mode in the account of FIRST ADDITIONAL DISTRICT COURT, MACT, Vellore in Account No. 35965368047 (IFSC Code SBIN0008688) of SBI, Sathuvachari Branch, Vellore, under intimation to this court and claimants. The 1st petitioner, who is the wife of the deceased is entitled to get Rs. 9,00,000/- from the above award amount. The minor petitioners 2 and 3 are entitled to the remaining award amount equally. In the first instance, the 1st petitioner is ordered to receive 50% along with entire interest accrued thereupon on it and costs.

Date of Accident : 18.09.2015 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.50,00,000/- 2 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The 1st petitioner is the wife, petitioners 2 to 5 are sons of deceased Thavaseelan. On 18.09.2015 at about 2.35 P.M., while the deceased was riding the motorcycle bearing Registration No. TN-23-F-9171 on the left side of the road at Thorapadi to Vellore road, Bishop David Nagar near the junction road, at that time, the respondent's bus bearing Registration No. TN-32-N-2625 driven by its driver came in the same direction, in a rash and negligent manner, endangering human life without following the traffic rules and dashed the motorcycle of the deceased. As a result of which, the deceased sustained grievous injury in his head and all over the body and died on the way to the Government Vellore Medical College Hospital, Vellore. Vellore South Police registered the case against the respondent's bus driver in Crime No.534/15, u/s 279,304(A) of I.P.C. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and he was working as a co-operative store employee and he earned Rs.13,000 per month. Due to the sudden demise of the deceased the petitioners' entire future life is fully doomed and questionable. The deceased was the sole bread winner of his family. Hence, the petitioners have claimed compensation of Rs.50,00,000/- from the respondent. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN THE COUNTER OF THE RESPONDENT:- This petition is not maintainable either in law or on facts. It is denied that the driver of the respondent was rash and negligent at the time of accident. The manner of accident as alleged by the petitioners is not correct. In fact, on 18.09.2015 the bus driver took the trip of bus bearing registration No. TN 23 N 2625 from Bagayam to Vellore and proceeding near DIG Bungalow at about 2.15 P.M., at normal speed and at the same time, the motorcycle bearing registration No. TN 23 F 9171 suddenly came from the left side and attempted to overtake the bus and in that course rammed the back side foot board of the bus and thus the rider of the two wheeler had invited the accident by himself and succumbed to the injuries sustained in the accident. The deceased was solely responsible for the alleged accident. Further the deceased has not possessed valid driving licence and not wearing helmet at the time of accident. The allegations regarding the age, occupation, monthly income of the deceased are not admitted. As the accident had happened only due to the rash and negligent act of the private vehicle/carelessness and negligent act of the 3 deceased and not due to the fault of this respondent driver, the petitioners are not entitled to claim any compensation from this Respondent. The compensation amount claimed by the petitioners is highly excessive. Hence, the petition is liable to be dismissed. 4. The Points for consideration are: 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the respondent's bus ? 2. Whether the respondent is liable to pay compensation to the petitioners? 3. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. On the side of the petitioner, P.W.1, P.W.2 were examined and Ex.P1 to P8 were marked on the side of the petitioners. On the side of the respondent, R.W.1 was examined. No document was marked. POINT NO.1 and 2: 6. The petitioner's case is that the 1st petitioner's husband, namely, Thavaseelan met with an accident on 18.09.2015 at about 2.35 P.M., while he was riding motorcycle bearing Registration No. TN-23-F-9171 at Thorapadi to Vellore road, Bishop David Nagar near the junction road. According to the petitioners, he was hit by the respondent's bus bearing Registration No. TN-32-N-2625. To establish the case, the 1st petitioner/wife of the deceased has examined herself as P.W.1. P.W.2 Subash, Auto driver has stated in his evidence that he was waiting for passengers on the edge of the road at Bishop David Nagar at the time of accident and Thavaseelan was proceeding on the extreme left side of the road and at that moment, the bus TN 32 N 2625 which came behind him in the same direction rashly and negligently, strongly hit the two wheeler ridden by the said Thavaseelan due to which he fell down and sustained grievous injuries in his head and all over the body. It is further spoken by P.W.2 that immediately after the accident, he has taken the injured in his auto-rickshaw to the Government Vellore Medical College Hospital but the doctors declared that the injured was brought dead. The xerox copy of F.I.R., Ex.P1 reveals that the diver of the bus bearing registration No.TN 32 N 2625 was booked by Vellore south Police in Crime No.534/15 for the accident u/s 279,304(A) of 4 I.P.C., based on the complaint given by the 3rd Petitioner Thamizhan, the son of deceased Thavaseelan. Ex.P2 Postmortem Certificate disclosed that the deceased would appear to have died of multiple injuries. Ex.P4 is the attested xerox copy of M.V.I. Report in which it is seen that the accident was not due to any mechanical defect of the bus which would in turn mean that the driver of the bus was responsible for the accident. 7. The respondent's bus driver Baskaran entered into the witness box and examined himself as R.W.1. He has stated in his evidence that at the time of accident, he has driven the bus at normal speed near DIG bungalow and that the motorcyclist suddenly came from his left side and tried to overtake the bus and in that process, he rammed over the rear side foot board of the bus and thereby invited the accident. No proof is filed to prove the said contention. He has admitted in the cross examination that the criminal case was filed against him for the accident and the case is pending. The eye witness P.W.2 has clearly stated that the driver of the bus has caused the accident by his rash and negligent driving. Therefore, it is held that the accident took place only due to the rash and negligent driving of the bus driver, for which, the respondent is liable to compensate the petitioners and these points are answered accordingly. POINT NO.3: 8. There are five claimants in this case. The 1st petitioner is the wife and the petitioners 2 to 5 are sons of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P3 legal heirship certificate. The petitioners/claimants have claimed Rs.50,00,000/- as compensation. For computing the quantum of compensation, the following factors are considered: AGE 9. The petitioners have filed the xerox copy of Transfer Certificate of the deceased and marked the same as Ex.P5 in which it is seen that the date of birth of the deceased was 01.06.1963. As per Ex.P5, the correct age of the deceased at the time of accident was 52. INCOME 10. P.W.1 deposed that at the time of accident, her husband deceased Thavaseelan was working as Salesman in Vellore Agricultural Producers Co- 5 operative Society and earning Rs.13,000/- per month. She has marked the Identity Card of the deceased as Ex.P6 to show the occupation of the deceased. Ex.P8 is the salary certificate of the deceased and his salary for the month of August 2015 is Rs.12,127/- and after deductions towards ESI, EPF and LIC etc., he has drawn Rs.8,920/- as taken home pay. The deceased died while in service. P.W.1 has stated that the 2nd petitioner has got appointment in the Society on compassion ground after his father's demise. Taking into account of statutory deductions which are refundable as mentioned in Ex.P8, his monthly income is fixed at Rs.8,920/-. FUTURE PROSPECTS 11. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. In the case between National Insurance Company Limited -vs- Pranay Sethi, it is rendered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India that there should be an addition of 15% if the deceased is between the age of 50 to 60 years and there should be no addition thereafter. By keeping in view of the same and considering the age of deceased was fixed to 52 years at the time of accident 15% of income added towards future prospects and the monthly income arrived to Rs.8,920/- + Rs.1,338/- = Rs.10,258/-. Deductions: 12. The deceased was married person at the time of accident. There are 5 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/4th of income towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/4th deduction the monthly contribution to family was arrived to (Rs.10,258/- - Rs.2,565/-) Rs.7,693/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF DEPENDENCY 13. Considering the age of the deceased is 52 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 11 is adopted for calculation 6 of compensation. Therefore, t he “loss of dependency” to the family is arrived to Rs. 7,693/- x 12 x 11 = Rs. 12,91,572/- rounded of into Rs.10,15,476/- rounded to Rs.10,15,500/-. 14. Apart from this, this Tribunal awarded Rs. 40,000/- towards loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner and for the loss of love and affection, Rs.10,000/- granted to each of the petitioners 2 to 5 and in total Rs.40,000/- is awarded and a sum of Rs.15,000/- is granted towards funeral expenses and Rs.5,000/- is awarded as compensation towards transport expenses.

Natarajan, B.Sc., B.L., I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Vellore. Thursday, the 16th day of February, 2017. M.C.O.P.No.202/2015 1. Rajeshwari 2. Elumalai .. Petitioners. /Vs/ The Managing Director, Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation Vellore. .. Respondent. This petition, coming up for final hearing before me, on 13.02.2017, in the presence of Thiru. S. Dakshinamoorthy, Advocate for the Petitioners and Thiru. M.Raju, counsel for the respondent and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court doth delivereth the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 3. Name of deceased Person : Sathishkumar 4. Age of the person dead : 27 years 5. Occupation : Armed Reserve Police 6. Income pleaded : Rs.35,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 31.10.2014 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.60,00,000/- 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the parents of the deceased Sathishkumar who died in a road accident. That on 31.10.2014 at about 11.00 P.M, while the deceased was riding two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-23-BB- 1053 in a slow and careful manner on left side of the road, at Thorapadi Star Medical 2 shop opposite near Murugam Temple, the bus bearing Regn.No. TN-23-N-1910, owned by the respondent was driven by its driver Mr. Anandan in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler ridden by the deceased and as a result of the accident the deceased sustained head injury on all over the body and died on the spot. The accident was reported to Bagayam P olice and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 350/2014, u/s. 279 & 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and working as Armed Reserve police and earned Rs. 35,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this claim petition claiming Rs.60,00,000/- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR THE RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. This Respondent's driver drove the bus in slow and careful manner following all traffic rules. But the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler by the deceased. On seeing the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler, this respondent's driver stopped the bus on the left side of the road, in spite of that due to rash and negligent riding the deceased lost control of two wheeler and dashed on the front side of the bus and hence the claimants are not entitled for compensation. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the respondent ? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 2nd petitioner examined as PW1 and Mr. Sankar examined as PW2. Mr. Kanniyappan, the Head Clerk, Superintendent of police office, Vellore, has examined as PW3. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P7 and Ex.X1 marked on the side of the Petitioners. The bus driver Mr.Anandan examined as RW1 and through him no documents marked. POINT NO.1 6. It is admitted fact the Respondent is the owner of the offending bus bearing Reg.No. TN-23-N-1910 and it was driven by the RW1 as a driver at the time of accident. The petitioners contended that the Respondent's driver drove the offending vehicle in a rash and negligence manner and dashed against the deceased and so that sustained 3 Head injuries and died on the spot. But, the Respondent denied the manner of accident as pleaded by the petitioners and contended that the RW1 drove the bus in a slow and careful manner and the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of two wheeler by the deceased. The offending vehicle was inspected by the MVI and issued the Ex.P.3 M.V.I. report stating the tyre condition was satisfactory and the Breaking system was in order and there was no mechanical defect in the offending vehicle. Since, the Respondent denied the manner of accident as pleaded by the claimants and there was no mechanical defect in the offending vehicle, we have to decide whether the R.W.1 is responsible for the accident and there was any contributory negligence on the part of deceased. 7. The P.W.1 deposed that on 31.10.2014 at about 11.00 P.M, while the deceased was riding two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-23-BB-1053 in a slow and careful manner on left side of the road, at Thorapadi Star Medical shop opposite near Murugam Temple, the bus bearing Regn.No. TN-23-N-1910, owned by the respondent was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler ridden by the deceased and as a result of the accident the deceased sustained head injury on all over the body and died on spot. The P.W.1 not seen the accident directly and hence the PW1 evidence is not sufficient to prove the manner of accident. 8. The PW2 is Auto driver and examined as occurrence witness. The PW2 deposed that when he was standing at Thorapadi Murugan Koil Auto stand along with his Auto on 31.10.2014 at about 11.00 P.M, the deceased was riding two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN- 23-BB-1053 in a slow and careful manner on left side of the road, at Thorapadi Star Medical shop opposite near Murugam Temple, the bus bearing Reg.No. TN-23-N-1910, owned by the respondent was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler ride by the deceased and as a result of the accident the deceased sustained head injury on all over the body and died on the spot. 9. The P.W.1 lodged complaint to Bagayam police station and they have registered a case in Cr.No.350/2014 for offence u/s 279 & 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and wherein also it was stated the R.W.1 drove the bus in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. After investigation the police has filed the charge sheet against the R.W.1 and this fact was proved through the Ex.P.5 copy of charge sheet. The police Investigation revealed the R.W.1 drove the bus in rash and 4 negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. The R.W.1 deposed that he drove the bus in slow and careful manner, but the deceased ride the two wheeler in rash and negligent manner and dashed against the bus. The M.V.I. report for the two wheeler not produced by both parties. Like wise, the rough sketch drawn by the police Investigation officer also not produced by both parties. The R.W.1 not deposed in chief proof affidavit that the deceased coming on wrong side and dashed against the bus. Under these circumstances, the careful perusal of PW.2 evidence proved the accident was occurred only due to rash and negligent driving of R.W.1. Hence it is decided the accident was occurred only due to rash and negligent driving of the bus by the R.W.1. Point No.2: 10. The petitioners are the parents of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.4 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein the Doctor noted the following Injuries:- 1. Reddish brown abrasions a) Multiple small abrasions of varying sizes on the forehead with underlying soft tissue contusion: b) 3.2 x 1.5 cm on the left side of the chest; c) 2.5 x 1.8 cm on the upper part of left side of the abdomen; d) 3.5 x 1.8 cm on the lower part of left side of the abdomen; e) 5.5 x 3.5 cm on the lower part of left side of the back with underlying soft tissue contusion; f) 2.8 x 1.3 cm on the back of left hand; g) 2.5 x 1.2 cm on the front of lower half of left thigh with underlying soft tissue contusion; h) 4.5 x 2.8 cm on front of the right knee; 2. Vertically oblique linear laceration 2.1 x 1.5 cm x full thickness on the left half of lower lip with irregular contused margins. 3. Irregular complete fracture of left sided 2nd, 3rd and 4th teeth on both upper and lower jaws with surrounding soft tissue contusion. 4. Diffuse swelling on the back of the head was present; on further dissection: dark red diffuse subgaleal hematoma on the right fronto temporo parietal and bilateral occipital region of the scalp with underlying 7.5 cm linear fissured fracture of the right fronto temporal region and 12.5 cm linear fissured fracture of occipital region of the calvarium including the base; on opening of the calvarium: Dark red 2.3 cm thick subdural hematoma present on right fronto temporo parietal and bilateral occipital lobes; thin diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage on all over the surface of the brain. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died of Head injury. 5 11. It is already decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent driving of Respondent's driver. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in the accident. Hence, the Respondent is liable to pay compensation to the claimants. AGE 12. The claimants not produced birth certificate to prove correct age of the deceased. The Ex.P.6 is the copy of school transfer certificate and wherein the date of birth of the deceased was mentioned as 2.1.1989. As per the date of birth entered in Ex.P.6 Transfer certificate the age of deceased was 26 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report the age of deceased was mentioned as 26 years. Even though birth certificate not produced, considering the date of birth mentioned in Ex.P.6 school Transfer certificate and Ex.P.2 Postmortem Certificate the age of deceased person fixed as 26 years for deciding compensation purpose only. REIMBURSEMENT OF MEDICAL BILLS :- 13. The deceased sustained head injury and died on spot. Hence no amount was awarded under this head. INCOME 14. The petitioners claimed Rs.60,00,000/- as compensation. The P.W.1 deposed the deceased was working as Armed Reserve police at the time of accident and earned Rs. 16,358/- per month. The salary certificate of deceased for the month of October 2014 marked as Ex.P.7. The P.W.3 working as head clerk at Superintendent of police office, Vellore and through him salary details for the year 2014 marked as Ex.X.1.

Therefore, the monthly income of the deceased is fixed as Rs. 16,358/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 15. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. Recently in a ruling reported in in Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (2) TNMAC 55(SC): 2013 (9) SCC 54 , it was decided future prospects applicable in a case of self-employed persons also. The annual income of the deceased was Rs.16358x12=Rs. 1,96,296/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased was 26 years at the time of accident 50% of income added towards future prospects and the monthly income arrived to Rs. 16358 + 8179 = 24,537, rounded to Rs. 24,540/- per month. Deductions: 16. The deceased was bachelor person at the time of accident. There are 2 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted ½ of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After ½ deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs. 24,540 – 12,270 = Rs.12,270/- per month. MULTIPLIER FOR BACHELOR AND LOSS OF DEPENDENCY 17. The Honourable Supreme Court in the decision in Amirt Bhanu Shali vs. National Insurance Co. Ltd . (2012 (2) TN MAC 321 (SC)) has held as follows: The selection of Multiplier is based on the age of the deceased and not on the basis of the age of dependant. There may be a number of dependants of the deceased whose age may be different and, therefore, the age of dependants has no nexus with the computation of compensation. The claimants are parents. The age of 1st petitioner is 45 and 2nd petitioner is 53 at the time of accident. Hence as per the dictum laid down from the above ruling and considering the 7 age of the deceased was 26 years at the time of accident as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 17 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore the “Loss of Dependency to Family” is calculated to Rs. 12,270 x12x17=Rs.25,03,080/-. COMPENSATION FOR LOVE AND AFFECTION 18. In Asha Verman -Vs- Maharaj Singh, 2015(1) TN MAC 465 (SC), it is held in para 18, that each children entitled at Rs. 1,00,000/- towards love and affection and each parents are entitled at Rs. 50,000/-. The petitioners are the parents of the deceased and they have lost their love & affection of the deceased and it is not measurable by money. However, a small amount of Rs.1,00,000/- is considered in the lumpsum calculation towards love and affection. Funeral Expenses : 19. Decent burial is also one on the right under Art 21 of our constitution, The petitioner has failed to produced any expenditure statement relating to the funeral expenses, so the tribunal has awarded a minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- for the head, also relied the Judgment in Rajesh v. Rajbir singh [CDJ 2013 SC 485], the Hon’ble apex court has further held that “ Funeral expenses not only includes fee paid in crematorium or cementary but also includes religious practices and conventions performed on death in family. Hence in absence of any evidence to contrary, minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- to be awarded by Courts towards funeral expenses ”. Hence, a sum of Rs.25,000/- alone was considered and fixed the award in lumpsum manner. LOSS OF ESTATE, TRANSPORT EXPENSES AND DAMAGES FOR ARTICLES:- 20. This Tribunal considered future prospects and 50% of income added towards future prospects. Hence, this Tribunal not awarded any under the head of Loss of Estate. The petitioners not produced any documentary evidence showing the actual expenses for transport expenses. However, this Tribunal awarded Rs. 5000/- towards transport expenses. The petitioners not accounted for the actual damages caused in accident. Hence, this Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs. 2000/- towards damage to clothes and articles. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 8 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 25,03,080 2.Loss of consortium ...Rs. NIL 3.Loss of Love & Affection …Rs. 1,00,000 4.Loss of estate ...Rs NIL 5.Medical Expenses …Rs. NIL 6.Funeral expenses ...Rs. 25,000 7.Transport expenses ...Rs. 5,000 8.Damages to cloths and articles ...Rs. 2,000 ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 26,35,080 ------------------------- 21. In the result, this petition is partly allowed with costs and the petitioners are entitled for Rs. 26,35,080/- (Rupees Twenty six Lakhs Thirty five Thousand and Eighty only) as compensation . The respondent is directed to pay and deposit the award amount into this court within 4 weeks from this day with interest at 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this petition (5.1.2015) till the date of deposit, excluding period of default if any. The respondent is directed to deposit the award amount through NEFT or RTGE mode in the account of FIRST ADDITIONAL DISTRICT COURT, MACT, Vellore in Account No. 35965368047 (IFSC Code SBIN0008688) of SBI, Sathuvachari Branch, Vellore, under intimation to this court and claimants.

Vetrichelvi, M.L., Motor Accident Claims Tribunal Judge/ I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Vellore. Wednesday, the 7th day of February, 2018. M.C.O.P.No. 147/2015 1. Suguna 2. Minor Sree Aadesh represented by his next friend, the 1st petitioner Suguna. 3. Jamuna 4. Karunakaran ... Petitioners. /Vs/ The Managing Director Andra Pradesh State Transport Corporation Ltd., Hyderabad. ... Respondents. This petition, coming up for final hearing before this Tribunal, on 07.12.2017, in the presence of Thiru Naa. Gunasekar, Advocate for the Petitioners and Thiru M. Meganathan, Advocate for the respondent and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court doth delivered the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 3. Name of deceased person : K. Madhusudanan 4. Age of the deceased person : 39 years 5. Occupation : Manager, Green Bio Tech., Kovai 6. Income pleaded : Rs.25,000/- per month 7. Date of Accident : 21.08.2014 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.75,00,000/- 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the wife, son and parents of the deceased K. Madhusudanan who died in a road accident. On 21.08.2014 at about 6.00 A.M., the deceased was returning from Hyderabad after having 2 attended his official duty, by driving his car bearing registration No. TN-37-BJ-1163 towards Tirupathi direction on the left side of the road. At that time, the bus bearing registration No. AP-21-Z-0506, owned by the respondent, which came in the opposite direction very speedily went helter-skelter since the right side front tyre of the said bus burst and on noticing the rashness of the said bus, the deceased Madhusudhanan swerved his car towards extreme left side and in spite of his attempt to avoid accident, the bus dashed against his car and caused the death of Madhusudanan on the spot and two other occupants also died. The another occupant of the car by name Sridhar sustained multiple fractures and became unconscious and taking that as advantage, the driver of the bus had lodged a complaint against the driver of the said car. The Andra Pradesh State police without any verification filed an FIR against the deceased. The said accident is only due to the negligence of the driver of the alleged bus. Prior to the accident, the deceased was working as a Regional Manager under M/s Green Bio Tech private company and drawing a salary of Rs.25,000/- per month. The entire family depending upon the income of the deceased and now they are left in lurch. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs.75,00,000/- for the death of Madhusudanan as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER OF THE RESPONDENT:- The petition is not maintainable either in law or on facts. The respondent denied all the allegations made in the petition save those that are specifically admitted and the petitioner is put to strict proof of each and every averments made thereon. The age of the deceased is denied. The petitioner simply invented the allegations against the driver of the bus. The driver of the bus very cautiously drove the bus following the traffic rules and regulations. The accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the deceased who drove the car in the opposite direction without observing traffic rules in a zig-zag manner and hit against the front right side portion of the bus. The driver of the car does not possess a valid driving license at the time of accident. The amount claimed is very huge and there is no relevancy to the facts of the case. The petitioners failed to implead the opposite accident vehicle's owner and driver as the respondents for proper adjudication. Due to non joinder of necessary parties this petition is liable to be dismissed. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the respondent's bus? 3 2. Whether the respondent is liable to pay compensation to the petitioners? 3. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum? 5. The 1st petitioner examined as PW1 and Mr. Sridharan, Mr.Karunakaran and Mr. Venkatesan examined as PW2 to PW4 respectively. The Ex.P1 to P13 marked on the side of the petitioners. The Ex.X1 already marked on the side of the petitioners by consent. But mistakenly again Ex.X1 marked through PW4. Hence, the documents marked on the side of third party rearranged as Ex.X1 to X3. Mr. Sivanna examined as RW1 and Ex.R1 marked on the side of the respondent. POINT NOS.1 and 2: 6. It is the case of the petitioner that on 21.08.2014 at about 6.00 A.M., while the deceased was returning from Hyderabad after having attended his official duty by driving his car bearing Reg.No.TN-37-BJ-1163 towards Tirupathi, the car was hit by the respondent's bus bearing Reg.No. AP-21-Z-0506. According to the petitioners, the bus was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and since the right front side tyre of the said bus got burst, the bus went on helter-skelter and on noticing the same, the car driver/deceased Madhusudhanan swerved his car towards extreme left side and in spite of his best efforts, the bus dashed against his car and caused his death instantaneously on the spot. But, the respondent denied the manner of accident as pleaded by the petitioners and contended that the respondent's driver drove the bus in slow and careful manner and the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligence of the deceased. 7. The accident was reported to the Ranigunta police and they have registered a case in crime No.147/2014 u/s. 279, 337 and 304(A) IPC. The vehicle driven by the deceased was inspected by the M.V. Inspector and the report was marked as Ex.P8. In Ex.P8, it was stated that there was no mechanical defect in the vehicle. The respondent contended that the bus was driven by its driver in a normal speed, but the deceased drove the car in a rash, negligent manner and dashed on the front side of the bus and sustained injuries and died. So we have to consider whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the deceased or the driver of the respondent. 8. In Ex.P1, it is noticed that the driver of the respondent filed complaint before police against the deceased. Based on the complaint, Ex.P1 FIR registered by the 4 Ranigunta Police. In Ex.P1 FIR the contents of the complaint are stated as follows: "" On 21.08.2014 at about 6.00 A.M. at 16th KM stone near Vootukalva, in between Mamandur - Kukkaladoddi on Renigunta - Kodur Road and reported the same in Renigunta police station on the same day at 10.00 A.M. where in the accused cum deceased being the driver of TATA indigo car bearing Reg.No. TN-37-BJ-1163 by name Madhusudhanan drove the same in a rash and negligent manner with high speed, without taking precautions and proper care coming towards Renigunta side from Kodur and dashed his opposite coming APSRTC bus bearing Reg.No. AP-21-Z-0506 which was coming from Tirupathi side towards Kodur. As a result the accused driver of the car and one inmate by name Ramesh of Coimbatore of Tamilnadu were died at the accident spot. Another two inmates of the car by names Sridharan and Saravanan were sustained severe bleeding injuries on their person and shifted them to SVRRGG Hospital, Tirupati for treatment."" 9. Ex.P2 is the Tamil version of the complaint given by the driver of the respondent and in which it is stated as follows: @ 21/08/2014 md;W AP-21-Z-0506 Oyf;!; g!;!py; jpUg;gjpapy; ,Ue;J fhiy 5/30 kzpf;F g[wg;gl;L fh;D}Yf;F brd;Wf; bfhz;oUe;j nghJ khkz;L:h; fle;J rpwpJ J}uk; brd;w gpwF fhiy 6/00 kzpastpy; ehd; ,lJ gf;ffj;jpy; brd;Wf; bfhz;oUe;j nghJ vjphpypUe;J nfhL:h; jpirapypUe;J xU bts;is epw fhh; be/ TN-37-BJ-1163 ,z;ofh ECS thfdk; ntfkhf rhiyapd; FWf;nf tUtij ftdpj;J ehd; vdJ g!;!pid !;nyh bra;J ,lJ gf;fkhf brd;nwd;/ Mdhy; me;j fhh; ntfkhf te;J tyJ g[wj;jpy; jpUk;gp vdJ g!; Kd;g[wj;J tyJ gf;fj;J lahpy; nkhjpaJ/ g!;!pd; Kd;g[wj;J tyJg[w rf;fuk; gh;!;l; Vw;gl;lJ/ ehd; g!;!pid KGtJkhf ,lJ g[w khh;$pd; gf;fj;jpy; jpUg;gpa nghJ ,lJ gf;fj;J kuj;jpd; fpisfs; gl;L g!;!pd; Kd;g[wj;J ,lJg[w bghpa fz;zho cile;Jtpl;lJ////// 5 So, as per contents of Ex.P1 and P2, the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the deceased Madhusuhanan who has driven the car on the fateful day. The learned counsel for the respondent argued that the tyre of the bus was burst after hitting the car against the bus and since the accident had happened only because of the fault of the deceased/car driver, the petitioners are not entitled to get compensation from the respondent transport corporation. 10.On the side of the petitioners, the 1st petitioner/wife of deceased Madhusudhanan, the 4th petitioner/father and the 5th petitioner/mother of deceased Madhusudhanan were examined as PW1 and P.W.3 and P.W.5 respectively. All of them have spoken that the bus went out of control after the burst of front tyre and dashed against the car. They had admitted in their cross examination that they had not seen the occurrence directly. PW2, Sridharan who travelled in the car is examined as eye witness to the accident and he deposed that 21.08.2014 at about 6.00 A.M., he was travelling along with the deceased in a car bearing Reg.No. TN-37-BJ-1163, and the car was driven by the deceased in a careful manner towards Tirupathi direction on the left side of the road and at that time, the bus bearing Reg.No. AP-21-Z-0506 came in the opposite direction rashly and negligently and suddenly the right side front tyre of the said bus got burst and hence mud particles spread on the road and the driver of the bus had lost his control. At that stage, the car driver Madhusudhanan reduced the speed and let the car to run on the mud road, even then the bus came in a helter-skelter manner and strongly hit against the car. P.W.2 added that deceased Madhusudhanan had driving licence and confirmed that the accident did not occur due to the fault of deceased. The driving licence of deceased Madhusudhanan was marked as Ex.P6. According to the eye witness, it is very patently proved that the accident had happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent's bus driver. 11. On the other hand, the driver of the respondent's bus, namely, Sivanna was examined as R.W.1. The C.D., and the photographs showing the collision of bus and car were marked as Ex.R1. R.W.1 deposed that on 21.08.2014, one Syed Ishaq who travelled in the respondent's bus as additional driver, had driven the bus at the time of accident. He added that the car came in the opposite direction in an unstable manner and dashed against the bus. The said Syed Ishaq was not examined on the side of the respondent. It is spoken by R.W.1 that the said additional driver Syed Ishaq died after one year. The accident was not disputed by both the parties. There is no doubt as to the manner of 6 accident that both the vehicles had collied head-on. Ex.X3 is the Report filed by the Renigunta police and it was marked by consent on the petitioners side. In Ex.X3 it is stated that the car driven by the deceased alone sent for MVI's inspection and that they have not forwarded the bus to the MVI inspection. R.W.1 had admitted in the cross examination that there is no possibility at all to the bursting of tyre if car hit against the bus. It is further seen from Ex.X3 that the case filed against the deceased Madhusudhanan was referred as 'Abated' and final report was filed accordingly. From the overall analysis of available materials, it is clear that due to head-on collision of both the vehicles, the accident had happened. The author of complaint/bus driver who had driven the bus at the time of accident was not examined. The eye witness who actually travelled in the car at the time of accident had spoken that the accident took place due to the fault of bus driver. The evidence adduced by R.W.1 is not being strong enough to fix the responsibility in entirety on the car driver. Therefore, it is decided that the accident took place due to the negligence of drivers of both the vehicles and the percentage of contribution of negligence is fixed equally on both the bus driver as well as car driver and hence, the respondent is liable to pay 50% of compensation to the petitioners and these points are answered accordingly. 12. POINT No.3: From the averments of petition and evidence of P.W.1, P.W.3 and P.W.5, it is seen that at the time of accident, the deceased Madhusudhanan was aged 39 years and he worked as Manager in Green Bio-Tech Company and earned Rs.25,000/- as salary per month. Ex.P3 is the Postmortem Certificate which reveals that the deceased was 39 years old at the time of accident. The petitioners have filed Ex.P4 Legal Heirship Certificate to show that they are the legal heirs of deceased Madhusudhanan. In order to establish the occupation and income of the deceased, P.W.4 Venkatesan, Sales Officer was examined. The authorization letter issued to P.W.4 to speak about the facts of employment of deceased is marked as Ex.X1. P.W.4 has deposed that the deceased Madhusudhanan was worked as Sales Officer in Green Bio-Tech for 11 months and earned Rs.25,000/- as salary per month. P.W.4 has admitted that he has not produced any identity card to prove that he is working in Green Bio-Tech. Salary Certificate of deceased is marked as Ex.X2. The competent authority who issued the said salary certificate was not examined. Ex.P7 is the Bank Pass Book of deceased Madhusudhanan which show that Rs.25,000/- has been transferred to his bank account on 08.01.2014, 14.02.2014, 11.03.2014, 03.04.2014, 7 08.05.2014, 13.06.2014, 07.07.2014, 07.08.2014 and on 08.09.2014. Ex.P12 and P13 Bank account statement and letter confirming the drawer of cheques have also revealed the said fact of account transaction. Even then, it cannot be taken into account that the deceased has drawn Rs.25,000/- as monthly salary on the basis of entries found in Ex.P7, P12 and P13 since salary of Rs.25,000/- had not been deposited into the bank account of the deceased at regular intervals at the end of the month. The petitioners' plea as to the monthly income of deceased was not proved properly. P.W.1 has admitted that she has received Rs.2,00,000/- through Group Insurance Policy taken by the Employer of deceased. The petitioners have filed Ex.P11 to show the education status of deceased from which it is seen that the deceased was the B.Com., degree holder. Therefore, it is held that as a degree holder and as a Sales Officer the deceased could have been earned not less than Rs.10,000/- per month. Thus, his annual income would be Rs.10,000/- x 12 = 1,20,000/-. As held by Hon'ble Apex Court in The National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and Others, Special Leave petition (Civil) No. 25590 of 2014 order dated 31.10.2017 , an addition of 40% of the said income i.e., Rs,.48,000/- is to be taken into account towards future prospects. A s per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others , and this Court deducted 1/4th of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. For the age group of deceased, proper multiplier is 15. In such manner, the loss of dependency is calculated as 1,68,000/- x 1/4 x 15 = 6,30,000/-. Apart from that the 1st petitioner is entitled to get Rs.40,000/- towards loss of consortium since she lost her life companionship of deceased in her young age. Further the petitioners 1 to 4 are entitled to get Rs.50,000/- each as compensation towards loss of love and affection(Rs.50,000/- x 4 = Rs.2,00,000/-). Rs.5,000/- is awarded as damage to the articles of deceased. Rs.15,000/- is awarded as compensation towards funeral expenses and Rs.10,000/- is awarded as transport expenses. Thus, Rs.9,00,000/- is awarded to the petitioners as compensation in toto and the abstract of compensation is shown as follows: Loss of Dependency Rs.6,30,000/- Loss of Consortium Rs. 40,000/- Loss of Love and Affection Rs.2,00,000/- Towards Damage to articles Rs. 5,000/- Towards Funeral Expenses Rs. 15,000/- Towards Transport Expenses Rs. 10,000/- Total Rs.9,00,000/- 8 But, as held in Point Nos 1 and 2, the respondent transport corporation is liable to pay 50% of the said award amount i.e., Rs.4,50,000/- to the petitioners as compensation in this case. This point is answered accordingly. In the result, this petition is partly allowed with costs and the petitioners are entitled for Rs.9,00,000/- (Rupees Nine Lakh only) as compensation . As held in Point Nos.1 and 2, the respondent is directed to pay and deposit 50% of the award amount i.e., Rs. 4,50,000/- (Rupees Four Lakh and Fifty Thousand Only) into this court within 4 weeks from this day with interest at 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this petition (12.11.2014) till the date of deposit, excluding the period of default if any. The respondent is directed to deposit the award amount through NEFT or RTGE mode in the account of FIRST ADDITIONAL DISTRICT COURT, MACT, Vellore in Account No. 35965368047 (IFSC Code SBIN0008688) of SBI, Sathuvachari Branch, Vellore, under intimation to this court and claimants. Out of Rs.4,50,000/-, the 1st petitioner/wife is entitled to get Rs.1,50,000/- as her share. the 2nd minor petitioner is entitled to get Rs.1,50,000/- and the petitioners 3 and 4 are entitled to get Rs.75,000/- each as their shares. The award amount allotted to the 2nd minor petitioner is ordered to be deposited in any one of the nationalized bank till he attains majority. The shares of the petitioners 1, 3 and 4 are ordered to be deposited in any one of the nationalized Bank for a period of three years. The petitioners are directed to pay the deficit Court fee of Rs.3,870.00 into this Court within Ten Days, from the date of this order, failing which, the petitioners are not entitled for interest for the default period.

In the accident, the petitioner in MCOP Nos. 299/2015, 300/2015 and 301/2015 were sustained grievous injury and immediately they rushed to Government Hospital, Gudiyatham and took treatment. The accident was reported to Gudiyatham Town police station and they have registered case in Cr.No.748/2014 for offence u/s. 279, 337 and 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and wherein it was stated the 1st Respondent's driver drove the bus in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the Asta Car bearing Reg.No. AP-03-BG-6619 and caused the accident. The Asta Car was driven by the PW3 and the P.W.1 and P.W.2 travelled in the said car at the time of accident and they have deposed the 1st respondent driver drove the bus in a rash and negligent manner from opposite direction and dashed against the Asta car. 8. The 1st Respondent contended the car in which the deceased travelled also contributed negligence to the accident. The deceased was travelling as a passenger and hence contributory negligence can not be pleaded against her. The RW.1 is the driver of the offending vehicle at the time of accident and deposed that he drove the bus on the leftern side of the road and at that time the car came in the opposite direction and the car overtake the TATA Ace mini lorry which was coming in front of the car and hence the car dashed on the right side of the bus. RW1 admitted that the FIR was registered against him. The Manager of 1st respondent corporation examined as RW2 and he deposed in cross examination that departmental enquiry was initiated against RW1 and it was pending. On the other hand, the P.W.1 to P.W.3 clearly and cogently deposed that the 1st Respondent's driver drove the bus in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the Asta car. Hence, it is decided the driver of the 1st Respondent is responsible for the accident. 6 POINT NO.2 :- (MCOP NO. 297/2015) 9. The petitioners are the son and daughter of the deceased Yesothammal and this fact was proved through the Ex.P4 legal heir certificate. In pending enquiry, the 2nd petitioner died.

The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died due to injury to the vital organ of brain. 10. It is already decided the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased Yesothammal was died only due to the injuries sustained in the accident. AGE 11. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased Yesothammal was mentioned as 70 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report also the age of deceased was recorded as 70 years. The petitioner not produced any document for the correct age of deceased Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof for Yesothammal, the approximate age recorded in Ex.P. 2 Postmortem Certificate treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only. Hence, the age of the deceased is fixed as 70 years at the time of accident. INCOME 12. The petitioner claimed Rs. 10,00,000/- as compensation for the death of his mother Yesothammal. It is stated the deceased was doing coolie work and earned Rs. 7,500/- per month. There was no evidence to prove income of deceased. The Yesothammal was house wife and in the absence of income proof, as per the settled position of law, the income of deceased Yesothammal could be taken as Rs.3,500/- P.M. 7 FUTURE PROSPECTS 13. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546 , the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary, to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. The deceased was 70 years old at the time accident, future prospects not applicable for this case. Deductions: 14. In pending enquiry the 2nd petitioner died and hence there is one claimant. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/3rd of salary towards personal and living expenses of income of deceased Yesothammal. After 1/3rd deduction the monthly income was Rs. 3,500x1/3% = 2333/-, rounded to Rs. 2340/-. 15. Considering the age of the deceased was 70 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 5 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, the loss of income for the death of Yesothammal decided to Rs.2340x12x5 = 1,40,400/-. 16. The petitioners totally claimed Rs.9,00,000/- towards loss of earning, transport to hospital, extra nourishment and damages to cloths and articles and claimed totally Rs.1,00,000/- towards funeral expenses, mental shock and agony, loss of expectation of life, loss of love and affection and loss of estate, but they have not filed any proof. However, for funeral expenses, this tribunal is awarded Rs. 10,000/- and Rs.10,000/- is awarded towards loss of love and affection. Since loss of income is considered, this tribunal not awarded any under the head of mental shock and agony, loss of expectation of life, loss of estate. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 1,40,400.00 2.Funeral Expenses ...Rs. 10,000.00 3.Love and affection ...Rs. 10,000.00 ------------------------ Total ...

Natarajan, B.Sc., B.L., I Additional District and Sessions Judge, Vellore. Wednesday, the 4th day of January, 2017. M.C.O.P.No. 46 of 2015 1. Selvi 2. Palani … Petitioners. /Vs/ The Managing Director, Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation Vellore. ... Respondents. This petition, coming up for final hearing before this Tribunal, on 16.12.2016, in the presence of Thiru. S. Dakshinamoorthy, Advocate for the Petitioners and Thiru M.Raju, counsel for the respondent and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court doth delivereth the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 3. Age of the person dead : 15 years 4. Occupation : Student 5. Income pleaded : Rs. -Nil- 6. Date of Accident : 3.7.2014 7. Compensation claimed : Rs.25,00,000/- 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the parents of the deceased Parthiban. That on 3.7.2014 at about 3.00 A.M, while the deceased was standing at Ambur to Chennai road, opposite to Srinivasa Nagar, the bus bearing Regn.No. TN-23-N-2278, owned by the respondent was driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and sustained head injuries all over the body and died at the spot. The Ambur Taluk P olice have registered a case in Cr. No.226/2014, u/s. 279, 337 & 304(A) of IPC. The deceased was brilliant in studies. 2 Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs.25,00,000- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR THE RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. The accident was occurred only due to the negligent act of the deceased and not due to the rash driving of the driver of this respondent. The deceased and other villagers suddenly crossed the road with chair car and the deceased also contribute negligence to the accident and hence this Respondent is not liable to pay the compensation amount. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the respondent ? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 2nd petitioner examined as PW1 and Mr. Vadivel examined as P.W. 2. The Ex.P1 to Ex.P.4 marked on the side of the Petitioners. Mr.Ramesh, the Respondent's bus driver examined as RW1 and through him Ex.R1 marked. POINT NO.1:- 6. It is admitted fact that the Respondent is the owner of the offending bus bearing Regd.No. TN- 23-N-2278 which involved in the road accident happened on 3.7.2014 and R.W.1 was driving the bus at the time of accident. The petitioners contended that the R.W.1 drove the bus in rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. But, the Respondent contended there was no rash and negligent on the part of the RW1 and due to sudden cross of the deceased and other villagers along with chair car, the accident was happened. The Ex.P.4 is the M.V.I. report of the Respondent's vehicle and wherein it is recorded there was no mechanical defect in the vehicle. Since there was no mechanical defect in the bus, we have to decide whether the R.W. 1 is responsible for the accident. 7. The P.W. 1 deposed that on 3.7.2014 at about 3.00 A.M, while the deceased standing at Ambur to Chennai NH road to see the Mariyamman Koil festival, at that time the R.W. 1 drove the bus in rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased 3 and so that the deceased sustained head injuries and taken to Government Hospital at Vellore and in spite of treatment the injured was died. The P.W.1 not seen the accident directly and hence his evidence is not sufficient to decide the manner of accident. The P.W. 2 examined as occurrence witness and deposed the deceased standing on the road side to see the Mariyamman Koil festival and at that time the R.W. 1 drove the bus in rash and negligence manner and dashed against the deceased and another and the another injured died at the spot and the deceased Prabakaran was died at hospital. The accident was reported to Ambur Taluk police station and they have registered case in Cr.No.226/2014 for offence u/s 279, 337 & 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and wherein also it is stated the accident was occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the R.W.1. 8. The R.W.1 deposed that he drove the bus in a slow and careful manner, but the villagers suddenly crossed the road by pulling the Chair cart and in spite of applying the break the accident was occurred. After investigation the police has filed charge sheet against the R.W.1 before the Judicial Magistrate, Ambur and after trial he has been acquitted and the copy of judgment marked as Ex.R.1. It is settled position of law the acquittal of driver by Judicial Magistrate has not affect the claim case. Three person died in the accident. The careful perusal of P.W. 2 evidence it is proved the accident was occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of R.W.1 and the R.W.1 not driving the bus with applying driving skill. Hence, it is decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent driving of the R.W.1. Point No.2: 9. The petitioners are the parents of deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.3 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein noted the following internal and external Injuries:- 1. Reddish brown abraded contusions: a) 4 x 2.5 x 0.5 cm on right side of the forehead; b) 2.1 x 1.2 x 0.5 cm near the right nostril; c) 2.5 x 1.4 x 0.5 cm on the left cheek; d) 11.1 x 6.2 x 0.8 cm on the left fronto-temporal region of the scalp. On further dissection of head: Diffuse subgaleal hematoma on the left fronto-temporo-parietal region of the calvarium; linear 12.5 cm fissured fracture on the left temporo-parietal region of the calvarium; on opening the calvarium: 1.5 cm thick dark red sub dural hematoma on left fronto-temporo- parietal lobes; thin layer of sub arachnoid hemorrhage was present all over the surface of 4 the brain; brain edematous; cut section was pale. 2. Vertically oblique linear laceration 5.8 x 1.8 x 11 cm on front of upper half of left arm with underlying soft tissue contusions. 3. Vertically oblique linear laceration 2.8 x 1.1 x 0.8 cm on left side of the abdomen with underlying soft tissue contusion. 4. Swelling and deformity of lower half of the left leg present; on further dissection: Irregular complete fracture of both bones of the leg with surrounding soft tissue contusion and extravasation of blood about 100 gm of clotted blood was present. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died of due to multiple injuries. 10. It is already decided the R.W.1 is responsible for the accident. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only because of the injuries sustained in the accident. Hence it is decided the Respondent is liable to pay the compensation to the petitioners. AGE 11. The petitioners not produced any evidence to prove the age of the deceased. In claim application the age of deceased mentioned as 15 years. In Ex.P.2 postmortem certificate the approximate age of the deceased mentioned as 13 years. The P.W.1 deposed in cross examination that his son was 13 years old student at the time of accident. Hence, the age of deceased fixed at 13 years at the time of accident. INCOME 12. The petitioners claimed Rs.25,00,000/- as compensation. The P.W. 1 deposed the deceased was very brilliant student at the time of accident. The Respondent's counsel argued that the deceased being the non earning member, the notional income of Rs. 15,000/- per annum to be considered for the income of the deceased and in support of his argument relied upon the ruling reported in R.K.

Compensation claimed : Rs.10,00,000/- 2 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- That on 18.04.2014 at about 9.30 A.M, while the petitioner's son Ganesan was proceeding from Katapdi to Thiruvalam road, Tharapadavedu, Muthamizh Nagar near Zuari cement Godown and when he was crossing the road from south to north, a Auto bearing Reg.No. TN-23-AK- 5434, owned by the 1st respondent, was coming from east to west with heavy speed in a rash and negligent manner and hit the said Ganesan directly and due to the accident, he sustained multiple injuries and immediately he was admitted in Government Hospital, Vellore and taking treatment as an inpatient for 11 days and then he was taking continuous treatment privately and in spite of that he could not recover and his health was completely down and he died on 30.06.2014 in the house itself. Hence postmortem could not be conducted on him. Prior to the accident, the said Ganesan was a auto driver and used to earn Rs.15,000/- per month and he is a married man. But he did not live with his wife and children. The said Ganesan was living with his mother namely the petitioner herein. The respondents 3 to 5 are the wife and sons of the deceased Ganesan. Since there was no understanding terms between the petitioner and respondents 3 to 5, the wife and children of the deceased Ganesan are impleaded as the respondents. The death caused to the said Ganesan was due to the said accident only. Till his death, he was continuously taking treatment. The said Ganesan was the only bread winner of the family. Due to the accident, the petitioner and the respondents 3 to 5 are suffering a lot. Hence, the petitioner has filed this petition claiming Rs. 10,00,000/- as compensation. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER OF 2ND RESPONDENTS:- The age, income and occupation of the deceased are denied. The valid driving license and necessary badge of the erring vehicle have been denied. The manner of the accident not admitted. The 1st Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in slow and careful manner following all traffic rules. But the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligence of the deceased who had suddenly crossing the road and hence this respondent is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioner. The deceased was not died due to the accident and he died due to some other ailment. The amount claimed is highly excessive. 4. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER OF RESPONDENTS 3 to 5:- These respondents are entitled for compensation as they are the legal heirs of the deceased. Hence prayed to pass an award in favour of these respondents. 3 5. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of the driver of the 1st respondent? 2. Whether the petitioner is entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 6. The petitioner herself examined as PW1 and through her the Ex.P1 to Ex.P9 marked. Dr. Shanmugasundaram examined as PW2 and through him Ex.P10 and P11 marked. Mr. Varadan, the Junior Assistant of the RTO office, Vellore examined as RW1. The Ex.X1 and X2 marked on the side of the 2nd respondent. POINT NO.1 7. It is admitted fact the 1st Respondent is the owner of the Auto bearing Reg.No. TN-23-AK-5434 and Mr. K.G.Yuvaraj was driving the Auto at the time of accident and this fact was proved from the endorsement in Ex.P3 M.V.I. report. It is the case of petitioner that the accident was occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of 1st respondent. But the 2nd Respondent denied the allegation and further contended that the accident was happened due to the negligence of the deceased who has suddenly crossed the road. In Ex.P.3, MV.I. Report it is stated the tyre condition is satisfactory and breaking system is in order and there was no mechanical defect in the offending vehicle. Since, there was no mechanical defect in the 1st Respondent's vehicle, we have to decide whether the accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st Respondent. 8. The petitioner deposed that on 18.04.2014 at about 9.30 A.M, while her son Ganesan was proceeding from Katapdi to Thiruvalam road, Tharapadavedu, Muthamizh Nagar near Zuari cement Godown and when he was crossing the road from south to north, a Auto bearing Reg.No. TN-23-AK-5434, was coming from east to west with heavy speed in a rash and negligent manner and hit the said Ganesan directly and due to the accident, he sustained multiple injuries and immediately he was admitted in Government Hospital, Vellore and taking treatment as an inpatient for 11 days and then he was taking continuous treatment privately and in spite of that he could not recover and his health was completely down and he died on 30.06.2014 in the house itself. The accident was reported to Katpadi police and they have registered a case in Cr.No. 123/2014 for offence u/s. 279 & 337 of IPC and the copy of FIR marked as Ex.P.1. The injured Ganesan himself lodged the 4 complaint before the police on 19.04.2014. In Ex.P.1, FIR it is stated the 1st Respondent driver drove the Auto from east to west direction in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against him while he was crossing the road from south to north. Considering in Ex.P1 FIR itself, the injured has stated the accident was happened while he was crossing the road, it is decided the deceased also contributed negligence to the accident. Considering the 1st Respondent's driver drove the Auto and the injured is the pedestrian, it is decided the 1st Respondent's driver contributed 75% and the deceased contributed 25% of negligence to the accident. POINT NO. 2:- PAY AND RECOVER 9. The 2nd Respondent contended that the 1st Respondent's driver has no badge to drive the vehicle involved in the accident. The R.W.1 deposed that the driver Yuvaraj not possessed valid badge and it was expired on 18.04.2014 and hence as per M.V. Act and Rules not eligible to drive the Auto which is transport vehicle. The Xerox copy of driving license of the 1st Respondent's driver marked as Ex.X2 through R.W.1 evidence. Through the R.W.1 evidence and Ex.X.2 license extract, the 2nd Respondent has established the fact that the driver of the 1st Respondent not possessed a valid badge to drive the offending vehicle at the time of accident. In the ruling reported in ICICI Lombard General Insurance Vs. Annakkili, 2012 (1) TNMAC 226 it was decided the Insurer cannot be exonerated from paying compensation to third party claimant for the reasons of the driver had no license or Badge and there was illegality in directing insurer to pay and recover from insured. The same legal position was reiterated in another ruling in National Insurance Company Vs. T.Mathiazhagan, 2012 (1) TNMAC 536, and United India Insurance Co Ltd -Vs- Rani Kaushal & others, 2017 ACJ 311, wherein the Insurance company proved the driver has no valid driving license and the Tribunal ordered pay and recover against Insurance company and it was decided in the case of Non-possession of effective driving license the Tribunal has rightly directed insurance to pay compensation and recover same from owner. In the circumstances, this Tribunal has sincerely obeyed the above rulings and conclude that the pay and recovery method is applicable to the present case. 10. The injured was died on 30.6.2014 and no postmortem was conducted. Since, there was no postmortem, the 2nd respondent contended that the injured was not died due 5 to the injuries sustained in the accident and he was died due to some other ailment and the petitioners not proved the direct nexus between the injuries sustained in the accident and death. On the other hand the petitioner counsel argued the injured was died only due to the injuries sustained in the accident and this fact was proved from P.W.2 evidence and also argued the non conducting postmortem no way affect the petitioners claim and in support of argument relied upon the ruling reported in New India Assurance Co, Ltd, -Vs- VijayaKumar & others, 2014(2) TN MAC 685. In the above cited ruling it is decided that when the Doctor opinied, the death was due to injuries sustained in the accident, the non conducting of postmortem is not affect the claim case. The petitioner counsel also relied upon another ruling reported in Oriental Insurance Co, Ltd -Vs- T.R. Subramani & others, 2013 (1) TN MAC 60. In the above cited ruling also it is decided that the deceased sustained multiple injuries including fracture on left femur and underwent continuous treatment in various Hospitals, the principle of "" Actio personalis mortur cum persona"" not applicable for the fatal accident case. 11. The Ex.P2 is the X–Ray report and proved the deceased sustained fracture injuries at left proximal humerous and right calcaneum. The Ex.P.4 is the medical prescription and it proved the deceased took continuous treatment at JAGAN SURGICAL CLINIC for the fracture injuries sustained in the accident. 12. The Doctor P.W.2. Mr. Shanmugasundaram, is Ortho Doctor and also treated the deceased for fracture injuries and also issued the Ex.P.11 disability certificate and deposed in his proof affidavit that he has examined the deceased clinically on 4.5.2014 noted the non union of fracture of proximal humerus with out ward augulation and totally restricting the movements of left arm and malunion of fracture of right calcaneus with broadening of heel and on the basis of Ex.P2 X-ray and medical report, he assessed the disability of the deceased and found that 15% partial permanent for fracture at left arm and assessed disability at 20% for fracture injury at the right foot.

It is also proved that the deceased not having any other ailment, that too to cause death. The 2nd Respondent not produced any document that the deceased was died due to some other ailment. Therefore, considering the PW.2 evidence and medical records, it is decided the deceased was died due to the fracture injuries sustained in the accident. AGE 13. The claimants not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of deceased person. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 36 years. In Ex.P.2 is the X-ray report and it was the earliest medical record in this case and wherein the age of deceased was mentioned as 36 years. Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximate age of deceased recorded in Ex.P.2 X-ray report treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 36 years at the time of accident. 7 MEDICAL EXPENDITURE:- 14. Immediate to the accident the injured taken to Government Hospital, Vellore and admitted as inpatient on 18-4-2014 and discharged on 28-4-2014. The Ex.P. 4 proved the injured take treatment at JAGAN SURGICAL CLINIC, Vellore. The Ex.P. 5 is the medicine bills and proved the deceased spend Rs. 1,986/- for medicine. The Ex.P.10 is the medical prescription issued by P.W.2. Even though the claimant not produced all medical expenses bills, considering the injured taking treatment at various hospital, this Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs. 10,000/- towards medical bills keeping in view the nature of injuries and medical bills placed on record. PAIN AND SUFFERINGS:- 15. The deceased was admitted at Government Hospital, Vellore on 18-4-2014 and discharged on 28-4-2014 and also underwent treatment at various hospital till death. Considering the nature of severe injuries sustained in the accident and undergone treatment as inpatient, this Tribunal awarded Rs.10,000/- under this head. INCOME 16. he petitioners claimed Rs.15,00,000/- as compensation. The P.W. 1 deposed the deceased was working as a Auto Driver at the time of accident and earned Rs.15,000/- per month. The petitioner not produced the driving license of the deceased to prove that he was driver and earned through driving profession. There was no evidence to show the income proof. The socio-economic condition forced to any individual to earn at the rate of Rs.200/- per day for his living. This court also consider the citation in Sadiq and others Vs. Divisional Manager United India Insurance Co., Ltd. 2014 ACJ 627, the claimant was a vegetable vendor who met with an accident in 2008 and the Hon'ble Supreme Court assessed income at Rs.6,500/-p.m. Considering the above legal position , this Tribunal has fixed the monthly income of deceased person as Rs.6,500/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 17. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546 , the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary, to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. In Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (2) TNMAC 8 55(SC): 2013 (9) SCC 54 , it was decided future prospects applicable in a case of self- employed persons also. The petitioner counsel argued that as per the above ruling the claimants are entitled for future prospects. The deceased not getting standard income. In the recent ruling reported in Chikkamma & another -Vs- Paravathamma & another, in C.A.No. 3409/2017, dated 28.2.2017, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided the issue of future prospects for unorganized sectors pending before the larger Bench and hence the concept of future prospects not applicable for unorganized sectors. The deceased in this case also not getting standard income and an unorganized sector and hence it is decided the future prospects not applicable to this case. The same legal position was reiterated in the ruling of our High Court, Madras , reported in United India Insurance Co. vs Yasoda; 2016 TN MAC 784, has decided regarding the future prospects for self-employer or fixed wages as follows:- “ the future prospects in case of self-employer or fixed wages, to be added to the compensation towards the dependency, there is difference of opinion among the cases in Sarla Verma v. DTC (2009) 6 SCC 121, Reshma Kumari v. Madan Mohan (2013) 9 SCC 65 and Rajesh and Ors. v. Rajbir Singh & Ors ., (2013) 2 TN MAC 55 (SC). One view is that there can't be any addition towards future prospects for the deceased working in a non-organised sector. Another view is that 50% is to be added as future prospects in those cases. The matter is before the Larger Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court. Therefore, let us not advert to the future prospects in this case and take the monthly income as his earnings without adding future prospects”. The deceased in this case also belonged to unorganized sector. Hence, considering the above legal position, it is decided the future prospects not applicable for this case. Deductions: 18. The deceased was married person at the time of accident. There are 4 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/4th of income towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/4th deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs. 6500 – 1625 = 4875/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF DEPENDENCY 19. Considering the age of the deceased is 36 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 15 is adopted for calculation of 9 compensation. Therefore t he “loss of dependency” to the family is arrived to Rs. 4875x12x15=Rs. 8,77,500/-. COMPENSATION FOR CONSORTIUM AND LOVE AND AFFECTION CONSORTIUM 20. In Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2009 (2) TN MAC 36 (SC) and followed in Shashikala & another -Vs- Gangalakshmamana & another , 2015 (1) TN MAC 785 (SC) it has held that “Loss of consortium is usually for loss for spouse’s affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations for future years and in such circumstances, Courts to award at least Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation for Loss of Consortium” and this position followed in Reliance General Insurance Co Ltd -Vs-K.Meena & others, 2015 (2) TNMAC 449 . The 3rd Respondent is wife and she deserted the deceased for several years and hence no amount was awarded under this head. Loss of Love & affection & Mental Agony and loss of Expectancy of life : 21. In Asha Verman -Vs- Maharaj Singh, 2015(1) TN MAC 465 (SC), it is held in para 18, that each children entitled at Rs. 1,00,000/- towards love and affection and each parents are entitled at Rs. 50,000/-. The petitioner is the mother and Respondents 4 & 5 are minor sons of the deceased and they have lost their love & affection of the deceased and it is not measurable by money. However, a small amount of Rs.1,00,000/- is considered in the lumpsum calculation towards love and affection. Funeral Expenses : 22. Decent burial is also one on the right under Art 21 of our constitution, The petitioner has failed to produced any expenditure statement relating to the funeral expenses, so the tribunal has awarded a minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- for the head, also relied the Judgment in Rajesh v. Rajbir singh [CDJ 2013 SC 485], the Hon’ble apex court has further held that “ Funeral expenses not only includes fee paid in crematorium or cementary but also includes religious practices and conventions performed on death in family. Hence in absence of any evidence to contrary, minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- to be awarded by Courts towards funeral expenses ”. Hence, a sum of Rs,25,000/- alone was considered and fixed the award in lumpsum manner. 10 Loss of Estate, Transport Expenses and damages for articles:- 23. This Tribunal not considered future prospects. This Tribunal awarded Rs. 50,000/- towards loss of estate. The petitioner not produced any documentary evidence showing the actual expenses for transport expenses. However, considering the treatment taken at various hospital, this Tribunal awarded Rs.10,000/- towards transport expenses. The petitioner not accounted for the actual damages caused in accident. Hence, this Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs. 2000/- towards damage to clothes and articles. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 8,77,500 2.Loss of consortium ...Rs. Nil 3.Loss of Love & Affection …Rs. 1,00,000 4.Loss of estate ...Rs . 50,000 5.Medical Expenses …Rs. 10,000 6.Pain and Suffering …Rs. 10,000 7.Funeral expenses ...Rs. 25,000 8.Transport expenses ...Rs. 10,000 9.Damages to cloths and articles ...Rs. 2,000 ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 10,84,500 ------------------------ 24. It is already decided the 1st Respondent has to pay 75% of compensation to the claimant. Since the deceased contributed 25% of negligence to accident, the petitioner has to bear the 25% of compensation. The 75% of compensation payable by the 1st Respondent is arrived to Rs. 8,13,375/- to the claimants. 25. In the result, this petition is partly allowed with costs and the petitioner and the respondents 3 to 5 are entitled for Rs. 8,13,375/- (Rupees Eight Lakhs Thirteen Thousand Three Hundred and seventy five only) as compensation .

The Divisional Manager, The United India Insurance Company Limited, Vellore. ... Respondents. This petition came up for final hearing before me, on 17.04.2018 in the presence of Thiru.S. Dakshinamoorthy, Advocate for the Petitioners and Thiru N.S. Ramanathan, Advocate for the 2nd respondent, 1st respondent called absent set exparte and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court delivered the following: ORDER Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 3. Age of the person dead : 65 years 4. Name of the person dead : Murugesan 5. Occupation : Cooli 6. Income pleaded : Rs. 9,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 06.03.2015 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.25,00,000/- 2 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The 1st petitioner is the wife, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th and 7th petitioners are the daughters and 4th petitioner is the son of the deceased Murugesan. On 06.03.2015 at about 07.00 P.M. the deceased was travelling as a coolie in a TATA ACE bearing Registration No. TN-73-A-7668. When the TATA ACE was proceeding on Chennai to Bangalor NH Road, Poigai Over bridge, at that time, in the same direction the Volvo bus bearing Registration No. KA 01 AB 7162 came in a rash and negligent manner and dashed the TATA ACE vehicle. Due to the strong hit the deceased Murugesan has sustained grievous injuries all over the body and immediately he was taken to C.M.C Hospital, and subsequently he died. The accident was reported to Virinchipuram police and they have registered a case in Crime No.78/2015 u/s. 279, 337 and 304(A) of IPC., Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and working as coolie and earning Rs.9,000/- per month. The petitioners are the only legal heirs and depending upon the income of the deceased. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs.25,00,000/-for the death of Murugesan as compensation as against the respondents 1 and 2 who are the owner and insurer of Volvo bus which caused the accident. 3. THE MATERIAL FACT STATED IN COUNTER OF 2nd RESPONDENT:- The petition is not sustainable either in law and on facts. The respondent denied all the allegations in the petition. The age, income and occupation of the deceased are denied. The validity of vehicular documents of Volvo bus is challenged. The driver of the Tata ACE vehicle has no driving licence at the time of accident. The bus driver also had no valid driving licence and since there is a violation of policy conditions, the 2nd respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. There was no rashness or negligence on the part of the bus driver. The accident had happened due to the rash and negligent driving of he Tata ACE van. Hence, the 2nd respondent is not liable to pay compensation. This claim petition is bad for non joinder of the owner and insurer of Tata ACE vehicle who alone are answerable to the claim made by the petitioners. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. Hence, the petition is liable to be dismissed. 3 4. The Points to be decided are: 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent ? 2. Whether the respondents are liable to compensate the petitioners? Which respondent is liable? 3. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 7th petitioner was examined as P.W.1. One Mahendiran was examined as P.W.2. Ex.P1 to Ex.P5 were marked on the side of the petitioners. No oral or documentary evidence were let in on the side of the respondents. The 2nd respondent has filed I.A.578/2016 u/s 170 of M.V. Act and the same was allowed on 18.10.2016. POINT NO.1& 2: 6. It is admitted fact that the 1st Respondent is the owner of the Volvo bus bearing registration No. KA 01 AB 7162 and one Mohammed Manzoor Ahamed was driving the vehicle at the time of accident. The petitioner has contended that the accident was happened only due to rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent. But, the 2nd Respondent contended the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the Tata ACE vehicle. In this case the accident was admitted and manner of the accident alone disputed. Since, the 2nd Respondent denied the manner of accident as pleaded by the claimants, we have to decide whether the 1st respondent's driver is responsible for the accident and there was any contributory negligence on the part of driver of the Tata ACE vehicle. 7. The 7th petitioner/ P.W.1 deposed that on 06.03.2015 at about 7.00 P.M. her father travelled in the Tata ACE vehicle TN 73 A 7668 as a coolie worker and that the vehicle was loaded with haystack and after unloading the same at Melmonavur and proceeding on Chennai to Bangalore NH road at Poigai over bridge the Tata ACE vehicle met with the accident due to hitting of Volvo bus and as a result of which her father sustained fatal injuries and later succumbed to the injuries in the hospital. In the cross examination, P.W.1 has stated that she had not seen the accident directly and that she could not say as on whose negligence, the accident took place. P.W.2 Mahendiran has spoken that he travelled along with the deceased Murugesan in the Tata ACE vehicle at the time of accident and the driver Manikandan @ Santhoshkumar 4 has driven the vehicle on the extreme left side of the road by observing all the traffic rules and the Volvo bus which came behind the Tata ACE vehicle came rashly and negligently and dashed against the Tata ACE vehicle. 8. The certified xerox copy of F.I.R., was marked as Ex.P1. By pointing out the contents of F.I.R., the learned counsel for the 2nd respondent argued that the accident did not occur due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of Volvo bus, but, it had happened due to the burst of front right side wheel of Tata ACE vehicle which dragged the bus into right side and hence, the Volvo bus which came behind the Tata ACE vehicle had happened to hit the same and therefore, the 2nd respondent is no way liable to compensate the petitioners. No oral or documentary evidence was let in on the side of 2nd respondent to fix the responsibility or contributory negligence on the part of the driver of Tata ACE vehicle. Ex.P1 certified xerox copy of F.I.R., disclosed the fact that the criminal case was registered as against the driver of Volvo bus bearing registration No. KA 01 AV 7162 in Cr.No.78/2015 of Virinchipuram Police Station u/s 279, 337 and 304(A) of IPC., for the offences of rash and negligent driving, causing injury and causing death to the persons who travelled in the Tata ACE vehicle. The offending vehicle was inspected by the Motor vehicle Inspector who issued the Ex.P.4 M.V.I. report stating that there was no mechanical defect in the vehicle which would turn in mean that the rash and negligent driving of the driver was the main cause for the accident. The respondents have not chosen to file M.V.I. Report of Tata ACE vehicle to prove that the accident has taken place due to the burst of front right side wheel of the said vehicle. P.W.2 has stated in his evidence in the cross examination that the Volvo bus hit the Tata ACE vehicle and caused the accident. Eventhough the Tata ACE vehicle got tyre burst at the time of accident, there exists a fair chance to assume that if the driver of Volvo bus who followed the Tata ACE vehicle had driven the bus in a cautious manner at normal speed, the accident would not have happened. At the time of cross examination of P.W.2, it is suggested to P.W.2 that there were four cases arose out of the same accident and one such case has been dismissed. No copy of such dismissal order was placed before this tribunal to substantiate the said contention. Based on the evidence of P.W.2 and Ex.P1, it is held that the driver of the 1st respondent's bus has caused the accident by his rash and negligent driving and the 1st respondent is vicariously liable for the negligent act of his driver. The petitioners have marked the xerox copy of insurance policy of Volvo bus KA 01 AB 7162 and it 5 reveals that the offending bus has valid insurance coverage at the time of accident. The 2nd respondent has not denied the said fact. So, as the insurer of the offending vehicle, the 2nd respondent is liable to compensate the petitioners for the death of Murugesan in the road accident. Point No.3: 8. The petitioners have stated that the 1st petitioner is the wife, the petitioners 2, 3 and 5 to 7 are the daughters and the 4th petitioner is the son of the deceased Murugesan. Ex.P3 xerox copy of legal heirship certificate shows that the petitioners are the legal heirs of the deceased Murugesan. It is further stated by the petitioners that after filing this petition, the 4th petitioner Palani, the son of the deceased Murugesan also died. By filing I.A. 50/2017 petition to amend the main petition under Order VI Rule 17 of CPC., the petitioners have stated that the 4th petitioner died on 03.11.2016 and that there is no legal heirs for him and therefore there is no need to implead the legal heirs of deceased 4th petitioner. As per order, dated 19.01.2017 in I.A. 50/2017, the main petition was amended suitably. Ex.P2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased Murugesan wherein the doctor opined that the deceased would appear to have died of injury to right lung. For computing the quantum of compensation, the following factors are taken into account. AGE 9. The petitioners/claimants have not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of deceased person. The petition averments and the evidence of P.W.1 reveals that at the time of accident, the deceased Murugesan was aged about 65 years. In Ex.P2 Postmortem report also the approximate age of deceased was recorded as 65 years. Considering that there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximate age recorded in Ex.P.2 Postmortem report treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 65 years at the time of accident. INCOME 10. The petitioners have claimed Rs.25,00,000/- as compensation. PW1 deposed that the deceased was doing coolie works and thereby earned Rs.9,000/- per month. No income proof is filed. Considering the age of the accused, it is no doubt that he might have depending upon the petitioners. The age of the petitioners 2, 3 and 5 to 6 7 are mentioned in the petition as 36,35,32,30 and 28 respectively. Considering the age of the deceased, this Tribunal has fixed the notional monthly income of deceased person as Rs.4,500/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 11. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. Recently in a ruling reported in in Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (2) TNMAC 55(SC): 2013 (9) SCC 54 , it was decided future prospects applicable in a case of self-employed persons also. In the present case, it was already decided that the age of the deceased is 65 years. Therefore, this tribunal has not granted any award under this head. Deductions: 12. There are 7 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/5th of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/5th deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs.4,500/- – Rs.900/- =Rs. 3,600/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF DEPENDENCY 13. Considering the age of the deceased is 65 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 7 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, t he “loss of dependency” to the family is arrived to Rs. 3,600/- x 12 x 7 = Rs.3,02,400/-. Loss of Love & affection : 14. The petitioners 2, 3 and 5 to 7 are the daughters of the deceased and they have lost the love & affection of the deceased and it is not measurable by money. However, a small amount of Rs.10,000/- to each petitioner is considered and thus the petitioners are entitled to get Rs.50,000/- in the lumpsum calculation towards love and affection. 7 Apart from that, the 1st petitioner is entitled for Rs.40,000/- as compensation towards loss of consortium and the petitioners are entitled to receive Rs.15,000/- towards funeral expenses and Rs.5,000/- towards transport expenses. Thus, the amount awarded as compensation under the eligible heads is given below: Loss of Income ...Rs. 3,02,400/- Loss of Consortium ...Rs. 40,000/- Loss of Love & Affection …Rs. 50,000/- Funeral expenses ...Rs. 15,000/- Transport expenses ...Rs. 5,000/- ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 4,12,400/- ------------------------- 17.

This fact was not specifically denied by the Respondent and hence it is decided that both the deceased were travelled in the bus bearing Reg.No. TN-29- N-2232 and after accident with Tipper lorry they have alighted from the accident bus on left side and standing on road side. 7. It is the case of petitioners that when both the deceased were standing on road side, the Respondent's driver drove the Government bus bearing Reg.No. TN-23-N-2064 in rash and negligent manner and dashed against both the deceased. The P.W.1 not seen the accident directly. The P.W.2 and her deceased daughter travelled in the Government bus bearing Reg.No. TN-29-N-2232 and alighting from the bus and standing on the road side.

In Ex.P.1 also it is stated the R.W.1 drove the bus in rash and negligent manner and dashed against both the deceased. It is also stated that about 40 or 50 persons were injured in the accident. The careful perusal of P.W.2 and P.W.3 evidence, it is proved the R.W.1 drove the bus in rash and negligent manner and dashed against the people standing on road side and caused injuries about 40 or 50 persons. Therefore, it is decided the accident was occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of R.W.1. Point No.2: (M.C.O.P. No. 309/2015) 10. The 1st petitioner is the wife and other petitioners are sons and daughters of deceased Raja and this fact was proved through Ex.P.5 legal heir certificate. The Ex.P.2 is the discharge summary issued by CMC Hospital, Vellore and it proved the deceased Raja was admitted on 7.12.2014 and discharged on 10.12.2014 and the Doctor noted the severe head injury and on 10.12.2014 he undergone operation at frontotemparietal decompressive crainectomy and evacuating of right temporal contusion.

The claimants not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of deceased person. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 53 years. In Ex.P.3 Postmortem report the age of deceased would appeared to be 55 years. Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximate the age recorded in Ex.P.3 Postmortem Certificate treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 55 years at the time of accident. REIMBURSEMENT OF MEDICAL BILLS:- 13. Immediate to the accident the deceased admitted as inpatient in CMC Hospital, Vellore and undergone surgery also. The Ex.P.4 is the medical bills and it proved the petitioners spend a sum of Rs. 56,321.50.

In the ruling reported in Managing Director, TNSTC vs Thahira & 3 others, 2016 (2) TNMAC 611 also it is held the notional income fixed by tribunal at Rs. 9,000/- was not excessive. Considering the above legal 7 position, this Tribunal has fixed the monthly income of deceased person as Rs.9,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 15. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. Recently in a ruling reported in in Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (2) TNMAC 55(SC): 2013 (9) SCC 54 , it was decided future prospects applicable in a case of self-employed persons also. It is further decided future prospects applicable to persons aged beyond 50 years and in case of self employed or on fixed wages, where there is no age of superannuation, 15% of income can be added towards future prospects for the persons in group of 50 – 60 years.

This petition is restored as per order in I.A. 58/2017, dated 30.01.2017 and coming up for final hearing before me, on 26.04.2018, in the presence of Thiru.S. Suresh Kannan, Advocate for the Petitioners and Thiru. P. Thulasimani Selvam, counsel for the 2nd respondent and Thiru.V. Ranjithkumar, Advocate for the 3rd and 4th respondents and 1st respondent remained absent and set exparte and no counter was filed on behalf of the 3rd and 4th respondents and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court delivered the following: ORDER Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 3. Name of deceased : G. Pachaiyappan 4. Age of the deceased : 48 years 5. Occupation : Security work and also owning provisional shop. 6. Income pleaded : Rs.20,000/- 7. Date of Accident : 26.07.2014 8. Compensation claimed : Rs.15,00,000/- 2 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION :- The 1st and 3rd petitioners are the Sons and 2nd petitioner is the daughter of the deceased G. Pachaiyappan who died in a motor accident. That on 26.07.2014 at about 9.45 P.M., on Chennai to Bangalore Road, near Kanigapuram, the deceased Pachaiappan was riding on his bicycle slowly on the extreme left side of the road. At that time, the 1st respondent’s driver drove the Car bearing registration No. KA 01 MG 0424 in the back side direction of the deceased with high speed, rash and negligent manner without following the traffic rules and regulations without blowing any horn and dashed against the deceased. Due to strong hit, the deceased fell down and sustained fatal injuries and died on the spot itself. Ambur Town Police Station has registered a case against the driver of the car in Crime No.257/2014, u/s. 279, 304(A) IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy. He was working as a Security and also running provisional shop, and earned not less than Rs.20,000/- per month. The petitioners are depending upon the income of the deceased. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners lost main support, main guide and bread winner of the family. The 3rd respondent is the second wife of the deceased Pachiyappan and the 4th respondent is the minor son of the 3rd respondent and deceased Pachaiyappan and they are impleaded as parties. The petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs.15,00,000/-for the death of G. Pachaiyappan as compensation as against the respondents 1 and 2 who are the owner and insurer of car which caused the accident. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR THE 2nd RESPONDENT: - The petition is not sustained either in law or on facts. The 2nd respondent is not liable to pay any compensation to the petitioners. The respondent denied the age, income and occupation of the deceased. The place, date, time and manner of accident are not admitted. It is denied that the death was due to alleged nature of injuries. The relationship of the petitioners to the deceased is denied. The petitioners are not the legal heirs of the deceased and they are not dependents of the deceased. Further, the 2nd wife of deceased is not added as a party to this claim. It is not true that the accident was due to rash and negligent driving of the car driver. The alleged accident had happened on the entire fault on the part of the deceased as he had ridden the bicycle in a hasty manner and suddenly crossed the National Highways road, without noticing the traffic. The deceased was atleast guilty of contributory negligence to a major extent. The FIR on the above accident was false one. To suit the convenient of claim the facts are twisted as if the driver of car was 3 responsible. The amount claimed is excessive and the respondent prayed for the dismissal of the petition. 4. The Points for consideration are: 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent ? 2. Whether the respondents are liable to pay compensation to the petitioners? Which respondent is liable? 3. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. On the side of the petitioners, P.W.1 and P.W.2 were examined and Ex.P1 to P7 were marked. On the side of the respondents, R.W.1 was examined. Ex.R1and R2 were marked. The 2nd respondent has filed I.A.1193 /2017 u/s 170 of M.V. Act and the same was allowed on 29.11.2017. POINT NO.1 and 2: 6. It is admitted fact that the 1st Respondent is the owner of the Car bearing Registration No.KA 01 MG 0424 and it was driven by one Jayachandiran on the date of accident. The petitioners have contended that the accident had happened only due to rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent driver. Ex.P5 is the MVI report, wherein it was stated that there was no mechanical defect in the vehicle. Since there was no mechanical defect in the vehicle we have to decide whether the 1st respondent's driver is responsible for the accident. 7. The 2nd petitioner / daughter of the deceased has examined herself as P.W.1 and she deposed that her father lost his life in the road accident which took place on 26.07.2014 at 9.45 P.M., Chennai to Bangalore Road, near Kanigapuram. She has stated in the cross examination that she has not seen the accident. P.W.2 Reeta has stated in her evidence that on 26.07.2014 at 9.45 P.M., she walked on the mud road at Chennai- Bangalore National Highways, Ambur Road opposite to Kannigapuram and that in front of her, the deceased Pachaiyappan was proceeding on the extreme left side of the road in a slow manner and at that time, the car bearing registration No. KA 01 MG 0424 came behind him rashly and negligently without blowing horn and dashed against him and sustained severe injuries on his both legs, hip and neck and as a result of which he died 4 instantaneously on the spot itself. Through P.W.2, the xerox copy of Rough sketch showing the scene of occurrence was marked as Ex.R1. It is seen from Ex.P1 certified xerox copy of F.I.R., that Ambur Town Police Station has registered a case against the driver of the car in Crime No.257/2014, u/s. 279, 304(A) IPC., based on the complaint given by Anandan 1st petitioner. The Investigator, namely, Murali, appointed by the 2nd respondent Insurance Company was examined as R.W.1 and the Investigation Report was marked as Ex.R2. The petitioners have proved through the evidence of eye witness P.W.2 and by marking Ex.P1 and P5 that the rash and negligent driving of the car driver was the main cause for the accident. Though Ex.R2 reveals that the car driver was acquitted from the criminal case filed against him, the verdict of criminal court would not bind this tribunal. The contention of the 2nd respondent that the deceased has caused the accident by contributing his negligence was not supported by any kind of documentary proof. Based on the evidence of P.W.1, 2 and Ex.P1 and P5, it is held that the driver of the 1st respondent's car has caused the accident by his rash and negligent driving and the 1st respondent is vicariously liable for the negligent act of his driver. The petitioners have filed the xerox copy of Insurance policy of the car KA 01 MG 0424 and marked the same as Ex.P6 and it was valid from 07.10.2013 to 06.10.2014. The 2nd respondent has not denied the said fact. So, as the insurer of the offending vehicle, the 2nd respondent is liable to compensate the petitioners for their Father's death in the road accident. POINT NO.3:- 8. The 1st and 3rd petitioners are the sons and 2nd petitioner is the daughter of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P.3 legal heir certificate. It is submitted on the side of the 2nd respondent that during the investigation it came to light that the petitioners alone are not the legal heirs of the deceased Pachaiyappan and that the deceased Pachaiyappan had two wives and after demise of the 1st wife/mother of the petitioners, he married one Kannammal and lived with her and that Kannammal gave birth to the 4th respondent due to the said wedlock. But no proof is filed to show that the 3rd respondent/2nd wife of the deceased Pachaiyappan is the legally wedded wife. The said Kannammal has filed a petition under Order I Rule 10(2) of CPC., for herself and on behalf of her minor son Aravind to implead her and her minor son as necessary parties/Respondents 3 and 4 in the claim petition and the same was allowed on 15.02.2018 since the petitioners have not filed any counter to the said application. Ex.R2 Investigation Report which contains the statement of the petitioners 1 and 3 herein and 5 other witnesses recorded by the police u/s 161 of Cr.P.C., reveals that the deceased Pachaiyappan married the 3rd respondent as his second wife who gave birth to the 4th respondent after the demise of his first wife. So, it is held that the petitioners 1 to 3 and the respondents 3 and 4 are the legal heirs of the deceased Pachaiyappan. Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and it proved the deceased was died due to the injuries sustained in the accident. AGE 9. The claimants have not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of deceased person. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 48 years. In Ex.P2 Postmortem report also the approximate age of deceased was recorded as 48 years. Considering that there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximate age recorded in Ex.P2 Postmortem report was treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 48 years at the time of accident. INCOME 10. The petitioners have claimed Rs.15,00,000/- as compensation. PW1 deposed that the deceased was working as Security and also running provisional shop and thereby he earned Rs.20,000/- per month. It is evidenced from Ex.P4 that the deceased was employed as Security Assistant at Globe Detective Agency. The petitioners have not produced any document show that he earned Rs.20,000/- per month through Security Job and by running Provision Stores . The socio-economic condition forced to any individual to earn at the rate of Rs.200/- per day for his living. This court also consider the citation in Syed Sadiq and others Vs. Divisional Manager United India Insurance Co., Ltd. 2014 ACJ 627, wherein the claimant was a vegetable vendor who met with an accident in 2008 and the Hon'ble Supreme Court has assessed income at Rs.6,000/-p.m. Considering the above legal position and the deceased was a Security Assistant, and considering the age and date of accident, this Tribunal has fixed the monthly income of deceased person as Rs.6000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 11. Recently the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided in The National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and Others, Special Leave petition (Civil) No. 6 25590 of 2014 order dated 31.10.2017, that in case of person has self employed on a fixed salary, an additional of 40% of the established income should be the warrant where the deceased was below the age of 40 years. An addition of 25% where the deceased was between the age of 40 to 50 years and 10% where the deceased was between the age of 50 to 60 years should be regarded as the necessary method of computation. Considering the income of the deceased was fixed to Rs. 6,000/-, the annual income of the deceased would be Rs. 6,000 x 12 = 72,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased was fixed to 48 years at the time of accident 25% of income added towards future prospects and the monthly income arrived to Rs. 6,000/- +1500/- = Rs.7,500/-. Deductions: 12. The petitioners 1 to 3 and the respondents 3 and 4 are the family members of the deceased in this case. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/4th of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/4th deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs.7,500/- – Rs.1,875/- = Rs.5,625/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 13. Considering the age of the deceased is 48 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 13 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, the compensation calculated to Rs.5,625/- x 12 x 13 = Rs.8,77,500/- and therefore the petitioners are entitled for Rs. 8,77,500/- as compensation towards loss of income. LOVE AND AFFECTION 14. The 1st and 3rd petitioners are sons and the 2nd petitioner is the daughter of the deceased. Ex.P7 Disability Certificate disclosed that the 2nd petitioner is the disabled person. The 4th respondent is also the son of the deceased. All of them have lost the love & affection of the deceased and it is not measurable by money. However, it is held that the petitioners 1 to 3 and the 4th respondent are entitled for Rs.20,000/- (Rs.5,000/- x 4) as compensation towards love and affection. 7 15. Apart from that Rs.5,000/- is awarded as compensation towards funeral expenses and Rs.5,000/- is granted towards transport expenses. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 8,77,500/- 2.Loss of Love & Affection …Rs. 20,000/- 3.Funeral expenses ...Rs. 5,000/- 4.Transport expenses ...Rs. 5,000/- ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 9,07,500/- ------------------------- In the result, this petition is allowed with costs and the petitioners 1 to 3 and the respondents 3 and 4 are entitled for Rs. 09,07,500/- (Rupees Nine Lakhs Seven thousand and Five hundred only) as compensation . The 2nd respondent is directed to pay and deposit the award amount into this court within 4 weeks from this day (04.06.2018) with interest at 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this petition (04.06.2015) till the date of deposit, excluding period of default if any.

This petition came up for hearing on this day in the presence of Thiru V. Padmanaban, Advocate for the Petitioners, Thiru J. Chittibabu, Advocate for the 2nd Respondent and Thiruvalargal A.G. Venkatesan and K. Venkatesan, Advocates for the 3rd Respondent and considering that the counter of 3rd respondent was not filed and the 1st and 3rd respondents were called, absent, set exparte and on hearing the arguments of both sides, upon perusal and having 2 stood over for consideration till this day, this Court delivered the following: ORDER Facts of the Claim 1.

Vehicle Particulars: Name of Driver : Thiru Sasikumar S/o Jayavelu (Not Possessed valid driving licence) Validity of Insurance Policy : Policy No.FCV/S2232605/31/04/C1315P Period from 29.04.2014 to 28.04.2015 (Policy not covered the date of accident) 10. Date of filing of Claim Petition: 01.12.2014 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The 1st petitioner is wife, 2nd, 4th and 5th petitioners are daughters and 3rd petitioner is son of the deceased Sekar. On 22.04.2014 at about 23:15 hours, while the deceased Sekar was walking on the extreme left side of Kalligapuram to Jadakondapuram road junction 5 K.M. west of Santhavasal Police Station, at that time, a tipper lorry bearing registration No. TN 25 AF 7925 driven by its driver Sasikumar came in a rash and negligent manner and hit against him vehemently. Due to the sudden impact, the deceased sustained severe crush injuries in 3 abdomen and right hand which resulted the fingers are fully damaged, grazed abrasion on the left leg below the knee till the ankle and multiple injuries all over the body. Soon after the accident, he was admitted in the Government Vellore Medical College Hospital, Adukkamparai. But he died at about 03:40 A.M., on 23.04.2014 in the hospital. Santhavasal P olice have registered a case in Cr. No. 53/2014 u/s. 279 and 304(A) of IPC., against the driver of the tipper lorry bearing registration No. TN 25 AF 7925. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and he was doing agricultural coolie works and also milk business and real estate business and thereby earning Rs.15,000/- per month. Due to his sudden demise, the petitioners are suffering with mental agony and monetary loss. The 1st respondent is the owner and the 2nd respondent is the insurer of the tipper lorry bearing registration No. TN 25 AF 7925. Since the vehicle involved in the accident was hypothicated with the3rd respondent, the 3rd respondent is impleaded in the petition as a party. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming compensation of Rs.35,00,000/- for the death of Sekar in the accident. 3. The counter contentions of the 2nd respondent are as follows:- The petition is not maintainable either in law or on facts. The allegations made in the petition are all false. The person driving the vehicle has no relation in force as on the date of accident to drive the vehicle. The vehicle TN 25 AF 7925 was not insured with the 2nd respondent at the time of accident. Hence, respondent is an unnecessary party. Since there is no contractual liability between the insured and the insurer, the claim against the 2nd respondent is liable to be dismissed. The policy mentioned in the petition was issued for the period from 29.04.2014 to 28.04.2015. Hence, the 2nd respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. The manner of accident is denied. The driver of the lorry has driven the vehicle slowly but the deceased suddenly crossed the road and hit against the lorry. It is denied that the petitioners are the legal heirs of the 4 deceased. The allegations regarding the age, occupation and income of the deceased are denied. The claim amount is highly exorbitant. Hence, the petition is liable to be dismissed. 4. The Points to be considered: 1. Who is responsible for the accident? 2. Whether the respondents are liable to compensate the petitioners? Which respondent is liable? 3. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner was examined as PW1. One Gurunathan was examined as P.W.2. Ex.P1 to Ex.P6 marked on the side of the Petitioners. On the side of the 2nd respondent, R.W.1 to 3 were examined and Ex.R1 to R3 were marked. POINT NO.1: 6. The petitioners have stated in the petition that on 22.04.2014 at about 23:15 hours, Sekar, the 1st petitioner's husband as well as the father of petitioners 2 to 5 met with an accident while he was walking at Kalligapuram to Jadakondapuram road junction 5 K.M. west of Santhavasal Police Station. According to the petitioners, the accident was caused by the 1st respondent's tipper lorry bearing registration No. TN 25 AF 7925. To establish the case, the 1st petitioner has examined herself as P.W.1. She has stated in her evidence that her husband was hit by the 1st respondent's lorry. She has marked the xerox copy of F.I.R., Death Report, Postmortem Certificate, attested xerox copy of M.V.I. Report Legal Heirship Certificate and Death Certificate as Ex.P1 to P6 respectively. From Ex.P1, it is seen that Santhavasal P olice have registered a case in Cr. No.53/2014 u/s. 279 and 304(A) of IPC., regarding the accident. P.W.2, Gurunathan has stated in his evidence that he has seen the accident directly 5 and that after closing his saloon shop, he was proceeding by riding bicycle at the time of accident near Kalligapuram to Jadakondapuram junction road and that the deceased was proceeding by walk on the extreme left side of the road and at the same time, Mahindra Lorry which came from Santhavasal towards Kalligapuram in a rash and negligent manner hit the deceased and caused him severe injuries all over the body and subsequently he died on 23.04.2014 without responding to the treatment. According to the eye witness/P.W.2, the rash and negligent driving of the lorry driver was the main cause for the accident. The contents of F.I.R., disclosed that the complaint was lodged by the 3rd petitioner and the Santhavasal Police have registered the criminal case against the driver of Mahindra tipper lorry bearing registration No. TN 25 AF 7925. Ex.P4 M.V.I. report reveals that the accident did not occur due to any mechanical defect of the vehicle which would in turn mean that the driver's rashness and negligence was the main cause for the accident. The counter contention of 2nd respondent is that the lorry driver has driven the lorry in a cautious manner but the deceased himself has invited the accident since he has suddenly darted across the road unminding the vehicle movement. But, the 2nd respondent has not established the said fact. The eye witness/P.W.2 has clearly stated in his evidence that the accident took place only due to the rash and negligent driving of the lorry driver. Therefore, based on Ex.P1 and the evidence of P.W.2, it is held that the accident occurred only due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the tipper lorry bearing registration No. TN 25 AF 7925 and the Point No.1 is answered thus. POINT NO.2: 7. It is the admitted fact that the offending vehicle is owned by the 1st respondent Elumalai. Ex.R1 Investigation Report and Ex.P4 M.V.I. Report disclosed the said fact. Further, it is noticed from Ex.R1 and Ex.P4 that the driver Sasikumar has not possessed valid driving licence to drive the tipper lorry at the time of accident. Thiru Karthikeyan, Investigator appointed by the 2nd 6 respondent Insurance Company while examined as R.W.1 has stated that the vehicle hearing registration No. TN 23 AF 7925 was insured with the 2nd respondent for the period from 29.04.2014 to 28.04.2015 and that on the date of accident, i.e., 22.04.2014, there was no insurance coverage for the said vehicle. The Investigation Report was marked as Ex.R1. R.W.2, the Manager of 2nd Respondent, namely, Thiru Shylappa Kalyan also deposed that on the date of accident, there was no policy coverage for the vehicle - TN 25 AF 7925. R.W.2 has marked the copy of Insurance Policy as Ex.R2. While the case was posted for cross examination of R.W.2, a memo was filed on behalf of the 2nd respondent stating that R.W.2 Shylappa Kalyan has resigned his job from 2nd respondent Insurance Company and hence it is prayed to eschew the evidence of R.W.2. The said Memo was recorded by this tribunal and the evidence of R.W.2 is eschewed. Consequently, Thiru S. Vinothkumar, Manager of the 2nd Respondent Insurance Company was examined as R.W.3. He has reiterated the same fact by stating that there was no policy coverage for the 1st respondent's vehicle at the time of accident. It is suggested to the R.W.3 that the accident vehicle was hypothecated with the 3rd respondent and that the 3rd respondent has to pay the insurance premium. R.W.3 has clearly stated that the premium amount was not paid by the 3rd respondent for the vehicle involved in the accident. 8. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent has drawn the attention of this tribunal to the provisions laid under Section 149(2)(b) of Motor Vehicles Act and also referred the case law reported in 2020(1) TNMAC 306 - New India Assurance Company Limited, Chennai -vs- D. Ramachandra Reddy (Died) and Others in which it is held as follows: ""...Owner of vehicle who is custodian of Cover Note and Policy remained exparte before Tribunal - Contract in Policy of Insurance would be operative only from time mentioned in it and not fictionally from previous mid night - Apex Court in Jikubhai relied upon - No Insurance coverage at the time of accident - Insurer 7 cannot be saddled with liability to make good loss suffered by insured - Finding of Tribunal that there was Insurance Policy at the time of accident, therefore, Insurer liable to pay Compensation, set aside - Claimants entitled to receive Compensation only from Owner."" 9. Admittedly, the petitioners have not marked the xerox copy of Insurance Policy to show that the vehicle which caused the accident has valid policy coverage on the date of accident. It is seen from the xerox copy of Insurance Policy which was produced by the petitioners along with the claim petition, the period of insurance was furnished as 'from 9.04.2014 to 8.04.2015'. The xerox copy was not in a clear manner. R.W.3 has clearly stated that the said document was a tampered one. As per evidence of R.W.1 and R.W.3 and Ex.R3, it is proved that the tipper lorry bearing registration No. TN 25 AF 7925 has not covered by insurance policy on the date and time of accident. As there is no policy coverage for the offending lorry at the time of accident, liability cannot be fastened as against the 2nd respondent. 10. It is submitted on the side of the petitioners that at the time of accident, the offending vehicle is hypothecated with the 3rd respondent Shriram Finance and that they are liable to pay compensation. The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent has submitted that the 2nd respondent has no objection for the same. On this aspect, the following case laws were cited for reference: 1. Hon'ble High Court's Judgment in Civil Misc.Appeal No.963/2005 & .M.P. No.11599/2005 - V. Subramani -vs- Valarmathi and Others, dated 23.12.2011. 2. Judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, New Delhi in Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.29544 of 2012, dated 29.11.2013 - The Manager, State Bank of India -vs- V. Subramani and Others. 3. (2002)3 M.L.J., 415 - K. Ramalingam -vs- V. Parvathi and Others. 8 Admittedly, the petitioners have filed this claim petition on 01.12.2014 against the respondents 1 and 2 alone who are the owner and insurer of the tipper lorry bearing registration No. TN 25 AF 7925 annexed with the xerox copies of F.I.R., Postmortem Certificate, Insurance Policy and Legal Certificate. The 2nd respondent has filed counter on 31.08.2016. On the side of the petitioners, P.W.1 and 2 were examined and petitioners' side evidence was closed and then R.W.1 and 2 were examined on the side of the 2nd respondent. In the Chief examination of R.W.2 which is filed in the form of proof affidavit, it is mentioned that the policy copy filed by the petitioner is tampered and the date '29' was tampered as '9'. While the case was posted for cross examination of R.W.2, the petitioners have taken steps and chosen to file I.A. 809/2018 on 24.09.2018 to implead the 3rd respondent Shriram Transport Finance Company Limited stating that the vehicle involved in the accident was hypothecated with 3rd respondent. The said petition was allowed and the main petition was amended suitably, impleading the 3rd respondent. The petitioners have not marked the xerox copy of Insurance Policy on their side. Neither the petitioners nor the 2nd respondent attempted to examine the 1st respondent or any competent authority of 3rd respondent as witness. There is no proof is filed to show that the 1st respondent's vehicle was hypothecated with 3rd respondent. The 1st respondent and the 3rd respondent were called, absent, set exparte. The 2nd respondent has clearly proved the fact that at the time of accident, there is no policy coverage for the vehicle involved in the accident and that they are not liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. In the case between V. Subramani -vs- Valarmarthi and others in Civil Miscellaneous Appeal No.963/2005, dated 23.12.2011, the Hon'ble High Court has held that the 4th respondent namely the State Bank of India under whom the vehicle involved in the accident was hypothecated, is liable to pay compensation to the victims since the bank is paying premium amount all along from the date of hire purchase agreement. The essence of the said Judgment is squarely applicable to this case also. Though the 3rd respondent has received 9 notice of this case and entered their appearance through their counsel, they have not chosen to file counter denying their liability. As there is no contra evidence on the side of the respondents 1 and 3, i t is held that the 1st respondent who is the owner of the vehicle and the 3rd respondent are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners and the claim made against the 2nd respondent is dismissed and the Point No.2 is answered thus. POINT NO.3: 11. The petitioners have claimed Rs.35,00,000/- in this application. The petitioners have stated that the 1st petitioner is the wife, 2nd, 4th and 5th petitioners are the daughters and 3rd petitioner is the son of the deceased Sekar. The 6th petitioner Radhammal is the mother of the deceased. Ex.P5 is the Legal Heirship Certificate and it reveals the said fact. Ex.P2, P3 and P6 are the Death report, Postmortem Certificate and Death Certificate respectively. Ex.P3 Postmortem Certificate reveals that the deceased would appear to have died as a result of crush injury in abdomen. The petitioners have not filed sufficient evidential proof for claiming Rs.35,00,000/- as compensation. Considering the available materials on hand, the compensation is computed as follows: AGE 12. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 46 years. In Ex.P3 Postmortem Certificate also the approximate age of deceased was recorded as 46 years. The petitioners have not filed any other authenticated proof to show the correct age of the deceased. Hence, taking note of the age mentioned in Ex.P3, the age of the deceased was fixed as 46 years at the time of accident. INCOME 13. PW1 deposed that the deceased was doing agricultural coolie works and milk and real estate business and earning Rs.15,000/- per month. There was no documentary evidence to show the occupation and monthly income of the 10 deceased. Considering the oral evidence of P.W.1 and also considering the age and date of accident, this Tribunal has fixed the monthly income of deceased person as Rs.9,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS: 14. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in its latest verdict in The National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and Others, Special Leave petition (Civil) No. 25590 of 2014 order dated 31.10.2017 has held that even in case of person has self employed on a fixed salary, an additional of 40% of the established income should be the warrant where the deceased was below the age of 40 years. An addition of 25% where the deceased was between the age of 40 to 50 years and 10% where the deceased was between the age of 50 to 60 years should be regarded as the necessary method of computation. The deceased was a self employed. Considering the age and nature of work of the deceased, this tribunal deems that 25% of monthly income should be added towards future prospects and thus the income of the deceased is arrived at Rs.9,000/- + Rs.2,250/- = Rs.11,250/-. Deductions: 15. There are 6 claimants in this claim petition. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009(2) TN MAC 1(SC) Smt.Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & others, this court deducted 1/4th of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/4th deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs.11,250/- - Rs.2,812.50 = Rs.8,437.50 MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 16. Considering the age of the deceased is 46 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 13 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, the compensation calculated to Rs.8,437.50 x 12 x 13 = Rs.13,16,250/- and therefore the petitioners are entitled Rs.13,16,250/- as compensation towards loss of income. 11 17. That apart, this Tribunal awards Rs.40,000/- as compensation to the 1st petitioner/wife of the deceased towards loss of consortium. The petitioners 2 to 5 are daughters and son of the deceased. The 6th petitioner is the mother of the deceased. They have lost the love and affection of the deceased and hence the petitioners 2 to 6 are entitled to get Rs.25,000/- each as compensation towards loss of love and affection (Total Rs.1,25,000/-). Rs.15,000/- is awarded as compensation towards funeral expenses and Rs.5,000/- is awarded as compensation towards transport expenses and also Rs.15,000/- is awarded as compensation towards loss of estates. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 13,16,250.00 2.Loss of consortium ....Rs. 40,000.00 3.Loss of Love and affection ...Rs. 1,25,000.00 4.Funeral Expenses ...Rs. 15,000.00 5.Transport expenses ...Rs. 5,000.00 6.Loss of Estates ...Rs. 15,000.00 ------------------------ Total ... Rs.15,16,250.00 ------------------------ Thus, the petitioners are entitled to get Rs.15,16,250/-. Out of the award amount, the 1st petitioner/wife of the deceased is entitled to get Rs.4,16,250/- as her share and the petitioners 2 to 5 who are the son and daughters of the deceased are each entitled to get Rs.2,50,000/- as their share and the 6th petitioner is entitled to get Rs.1,00,000/- as her share respectively. In the result, this petition is partly allowed with costs and the petitioners are entitled for Rs.15,16,250/- (Rupees Fifteen Lakhs Sixteen Thousand Two Hundred and Fifty only) as compensation . The respondents 1 and 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation. The respondents 1 and 3 are directed to pay and deposit the award amount into this Court within 4 weeks from this day (04.01.2021) with interest at 7.5% per annum from the date of 12 filing of this petition ( 01.12.2014) till the date of deposit, excluding the period of default if any.

Out of the award amount, the 1st petitioner/wife of the deceased is entitled to get Rs.4,16,250/- as her share and the petitioners 2 to 5 who are the son and daughters of the deceased are each entitled to get Rs.2,50,000/- as their share and the 6th petitioner is entitled to get Rs.1,00,000/- as her share respectively.

The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased Yesothammal was died only due to the injuries sustained in the accident. AGE 11. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased Yesothammal was mentioned as 70 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report also the age of deceased was recorded as 70 years. The petitioner not produced any document for the correct age of deceased Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof for Yesothammal, the approximate age recorded in Ex.P. 2 Postmortem Certificate treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only. Hence, the age of the deceased is fixed as 70 years at the time of accident. INCOME 12. The petitioner claimed Rs. 10,00,000/- as compensation for the death of his mother Yesothammal. It is stated the deceased was doing coolie work and earned Rs. 7,500/- per month. There was no evidence to prove income of deceased.

In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546 , the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary, to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. The deceased was 70 years old at the time accident, future prospects not applicable for this case. Deductions: 14. In pending enquiry the 2nd petitioner died and hence there is one claimant. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/3rd of salary towards personal and living expenses of income of deceased Yesothammal. After 1/3rd deduction the monthly income was Rs. 3,500x1/3% = 2333/-, rounded to Rs. 2340/-. 15. Considering the age of the deceased was 70 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 5 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, the loss of income for the death of Yesothammal decided to Rs.2340x12x5 = 1,40,400/-. 16. The petitioners totally claimed Rs.9,00,000/- towards loss of earning, transport to hospital, extra nourishment and damages to cloths and articles and claimed totally Rs.1,00,000/- towards funeral expenses, mental shock and agony, loss of expectation of life, loss of love and affection and loss of estate, but they have not filed any proof. However, for funeral expenses, this tribunal is awarded Rs. 10,000/- and Rs.10,000/- is awarded towards loss of love and affection. Since loss of income is considered, this tribunal not awarded any under the head of mental shock and agony, loss of expectation of life, loss of estate. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 1,40,400.00 2.Funeral Expenses ...Rs. 10,000.00 3.Love and affection ...Rs. 10,000.00 ------------------------ Total ...

The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died due to injury to the vital organ of brain. 10. It is already decided the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased Yesothammal was died only due to the injuries sustained in the accident. AGE 11. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased Yesothammal was mentioned as 70 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report also the age of deceased was recorded as 70 years. The petitioner not produced any document for the correct age of deceased Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof for Yesothammal, the approximate age recorded in Ex.P. 2 Postmortem Certificate treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only. Hence, the age of the deceased is fixed as 70 years at the time of accident. INCOME 12. The petitioner claimed Rs. 10,00,000/- as compensation for the death of his mother Yesothammal. It is stated the deceased was doing coolie work and earned Rs. 7,500/- per month. There was no evidence to prove income of deceased. The Yesothammal was house wife and in the absence of income proof, as per the settled position of law, the income of deceased Yesothammal could be taken as Rs.3,500/- P.M. 7 FUTURE PROSPECTS 13. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546 , the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary, to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. The deceased was 70 years old at the time accident, future prospects not applicable for this case. Deductions: 14. In pending enquiry the 2nd petitioner died and hence there is one claimant. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/3rd of salary towards personal and living expenses of income of deceased Yesothammal. After 1/3rd deduction the monthly income was Rs. 3,500x1/3% = 2333/-, rounded to Rs. 2340/-. 15. Considering the age of the deceased was 70 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 5 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, the loss of income for the death of Yesothammal decided to Rs.2340x12x5 = 1,40,400/-. 16. The petitioners totally claimed Rs.9,00,000/- towards loss of earning, transport to hospital, extra nourishment and damages to cloths and articles and claimed totally Rs.1,00,000/- towards funeral expenses, mental shock and agony, loss of expectation of life, loss of love and affection and loss of estate, but they have not filed any proof. However, for funeral expenses, this tribunal is awarded Rs. 10,000/- and Rs.10,000/- is awarded towards loss of love and affection. Since loss of income is considered, this tribunal not awarded any under the head of mental shock and agony, loss of expectation of life, loss of estate. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 1,40,400.00 2.Funeral Expenses ...Rs. 10,000.00 3.Love and affection ...Rs. 10,000.00 ------------------------ Total ...

Postmortem was conducted at Government Vellore Medical College and Hospital, Vellore on the corpse of the deceased. The accident was reported to Bagayam P olice and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 617/2011, u/s. 279, 304(A) of IPC against the rider of the two wheeler. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and working as a coolie and earned Rs. 20,000/- per month. She is only the bread winner of the family. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs.10,00,000/- as compensation. 3. The respondents 1 and 2 remained absent and set exparte. 4. The Points : 1.

Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner examined as PW1 and Ex.P1 to Ex.P5 marked on the side of the Petitioners. No oral and documentary evidence were let in on the side of the respondents. POINT NO.1: 6. According to the petitioners, that on 09.09.2011 at about 7.45 P.M, on Vellore to Arni main road, near Elumalai Hotel, while the deceased was standing at the extreme left side of the road, the two wheeler Bajaj Pulsar 150 bearing Reg. No.TN-21-E-7083, ridden by the 2nd respondent in a rash and negligent manner from north to south direction hit and dashed against the deceased and due to the strong hit, the deceased has sustained fatal injuries and died on the spot. The P.W.1 deposed that the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent ridding of the 2nd respondent. The Ex.P1 is the FIR, wherein also it is stated that the rider of the two wheeler bearing Reg.No.TN-21-E-7083, ridden the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased. The Two 3 wheeler was inspected by the MVI, and issued the Ex.P.5 M.V.I. report stating the accident was occurred not due to mechanical defect. No contra evidence on the side of the respondents to disprove the petitioners' case. Considering the evidence of P.W.1 and the Ex-P1 F.I.R., Ex.P5 MVI report, it is decided that the accident was only due to the rash and negligent ridding of the rider, the 2nd respondent herein. The owner of the vehicle/1st respondent is vicariously liable for the negligent act of his rider. Hence, the respondents No.1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to compensate the petitioners and this point is answered accordingly. Point No.2: 7. It is already decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent riding of the rider of the 1st respondent. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in accident. 8. It is stated that at the time of accident, the deceased was aged about 50 years. In Ex-P2 Postmortem Certificate also the age of the deceased was mentioned as 50 years. Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximate age recorded in Ex.P.2 Postmortem Certificate treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 50 years at the time of accident. INCOME 9. The petitioners claimed Rs.10,00,000/- as compensation for the death of Anushya. It is stated the deceased was working as a coolie at the time of accident and earned Rs.20,000/- per month. There was no evidence to show the income proof. Considering there was no proof for income of the deceased and considering the age of the deceased, this Tribunal has fixed the monthly income of deceased person as Rs.3,500/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 10. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more 4 than 50 years. The annual income of the deceased was Rs.3,500x12 = 42,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased 30% of income added towards future prospects and the monthly income arrived to Rs. 3500+1050 = 4550/-. Deductions: 11. The petitioners are the husband, daughters and sons of the deceased Anushya and this fact was proved through Ex.P4 Legal Heir Certificate. The deceased was a married person. There are 5 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/4th of the income towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/4th deduction (4550 – 1138 = 3412) the monthly income of the deceased arrived to Rs. 3412/- rounded of into Rs. 3500/- per month MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 12. Considering the age of the deceased is 50 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 13 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, the compensation calculated to Rs.3500x12x13=Rs.5,46,000/- and therefore the petitioners are entitled Rs.5,46,000/- as compensation towards loss of income. 13. Apart from this, this Tribunal is awarded Rs. 50,000/- towards loss of consortium to the 1st petitioner, and Rs. 10,000/- towards funeral expenses. The 2 to 5 petitioners are the daughters and sons of the deceased and they have lost their love & affection of the deceased. Hence, a sum of Rs.10,000/- for each petitioner, in total Rs.40,000/- is awarded towards love and affection. The petitioners have claimed Rs.1,95,000/- towards mental shock and agony. Since this Tribunal considered future prospects and funeral expenses, not awarded any amount under the above head. The petitioners claimed Rs. 5,000/- towards damages to clothing and articles, but they have not produced any documents, hence not granted. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 5,46,000.00 2.Loss of consortium ...Rs. 50,000.00 3.Funeral Expenses ...Rs. 10,000.00 4.Love and affection ...Rs. 40,000.00 ------------------------ Total ...

Claim for : Fatal 2. Name of deceased : Sangeetha 3. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 4. Age of the person dead : 24 years 5. Occupation : Maths & Yoga teacher 6. Income pleaded : Rs.35,000/ - 7. Date of Accident : 05.11.2014 8. Compensation claimed : Rs. 1,00,00,000/- 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the legal heirs of the deceased Sangeetha. That on 05.11.2014 at about 16.50 P.M, after vaccination to 3rd petitioner at CMC Hospital, Vellore, while the 1st petitioner and the 2 deceased along with the 3rd petitioner were returning to home, the 1st petitioner rode the two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-23-AU-5414 in slow and careful manner and when they nearing to Hyderpuram bus stop turning, the driver of the Respondent's bus drove the bus bearing Reg.No. TN-23-N-1805 in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler and so that the deceased fell down on right side and the 1st petitioner fell down on left side and the right rear wheel of the bus run over the deceased and immediately she has been taken to hospital, but the Doctors declared that she has been already died. The K.V. Kuppam P olice have registered a case in Cr. No. 396/2014, u/s. 279 & 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and working as Maths and Yoga Teacher in private school at Chennai and get salary of Rs.35,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming compensation of Rs.1,00,00,000/-. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR THE RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. This Respondent denied the accident. This Respondent's driver drove the bus with due care and caution observing traffic rules and he has not drove the bus in rash and negligent manner at the time of accident. There was no accident as pleaded by the petitioners and false case was registered against the Respondent's bus. The accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent act of the 1st petitioner and this claim application is not maintainable for want of Non-Joinder of owner and insurance company of the two wheeler. The petitioners are not dependent of the deceased and not entitled for compensation. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the respondent ? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner examined as PW1 and Ex.P1 to Ex.P19 marked. Mr.Babu, the Respondent's driver examined as RW1. No documents marked for Respondent. 3 POINT NO.1 6. It is admitted fact the Respondent is the owner of the bus bearing Regd.No. TN- 25-N-1805 and R.W.1 drove the bus on 5.11.2014 at the time of accident. The petitioners contended the accident was happened only due to rash and negligent driving of the Respondent's driver. But, the Respondent contended that the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st petitioner. The M.V.I inspected the offending bus and issued Ex.P.6 vehicle inspection report and wherein it is mentioned the tyre condition was satisfactory and the breaking system was in order and there was no mechanical defect in the vehicle and also noted the damages at right side body. The damages in the bus proved the involvement of the vehicle in accident. Since there was no mechanical defect in the Respondent's vehicle, we have to decide whether the Respondent's driver was responsible for the accident. 7. The P.W. 1 deposed that on 5.11.2014 they have vaccinated to the 3rd petitioner at CMC Hospital, Vellore, and they returned to home through two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-23-AU-5414, and the PW1 ride the two wheeler in a slow and careful manner on the left side of the road, when they nearing to Hyderpuram bus stop turning, the Respondent's driver drove the bus in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler and so that the deceased fell down on right side and the 1st petitioner fell down on left side and the right rear wheel of the bus run over the deceased. The accident was reported to K.V. Kuppam police station and they have registered a case in Cr.No. 396/2014 for offence u/s 279, 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P1 and wherein it also it is clearly stated the Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler and caused accident. After investigation police has filed charge sheet against the Respondent driver and this fact proved through the Ex.P3 copy of charge sheet and the case is still pending. The PW1 admitted that at the place of accident all vehicles go slowly and it shows the PW1 also ride the two wheeler in a slow manner. The PW1 evidence proved the RW1 drove the bus in negligent manner and caused accident. The police investigation also confirmed the accident was caused due to the rash and negligeny act of the RW1. Hence it is decided the Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in negligent manner and caused accident. 4 Point No.2: 8. The 1st petitioner is the husband, 2nd and 3rd petitioners are minor son and daughter of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P4 legal heirship certificate. The PW1 deposed the right side rear wheel of the bus run over the deceased and immediately taken to hospital, but Doctors declared that she was already died. The Ex.P2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein noted the following External Injuries:- 1. Fracture of shaft of left humerus present about 4x2x1 cm laceration present in the occipital region. Chest wall is deformed on the left side with fracture of ribs. Small bowels seen eviscerated through the vaginal vault. The Doctor also noted the following Internal Injuries:- 1. Ribs fractured on left side of rib cage. 2. Liver shattered and avulsed from the interior venacara. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died due to injury to Liver. 9. It is already decided the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of Respondent's driver. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in accident. Hence, the Respondent is liable to pay compensation to the claimants. AGE 10. The age of deceased mentioned as 24 years in claim application. The Ex.P7 is the 10th mark sheet and wherein the date of birth of deceased was mentioned as 29.06.1990 and it proved the deceased crossed 24 years and the age 25 is running. Hence the age of deceased was fixed as 25 years at the time of accident. INCOME 11. The petitioners claimed Rs.1,00,00,000/- as compensation for the death of Sangeetha. It is stated the deceased was working as a Maths and Yoga teacher at private school at Chennai. The petitioners not produced document showing the employment and salary details.

In the above ruling it is decided the income of the B.Ed, graduate at Rs. 8,000/- and this Tribunal sincerely followed the above rulings and fixed the notional income of the deceased is Rs. 8,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 13. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. Recently in a ruling reported in in Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (2) TNMAC 55(SC): 2013 (9) SCC 54 , it was decided future prospects applicable in a case of self-employed persons also. The annual income of the deceased was Rs.8,000x12=96,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased was 25 years at the time of accident, 50% of income added towards future prospects and the annual income arrived to Rs. 96000+48000=144000/-. Deductions: 14. The deceased was married person at the time of accident. There are 3 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/3rd of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/3rd deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs. 144000 – 48000 = 96,000/- per annum. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 15. Considering the age of the deceased is 25 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 18 is adopted for calculation of 6 compensation. Therefore the compensation calculated to Rs.96000x18 =Rs.17,28,000/- and therefore the petitioner is entitled Rs.17,28,000/- as compensation towards loss of income. COMPENSATION FOR CONSORTIUM AND LOVE AND AFFECTION CONSORTIUM 16. In Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2009 (2) TN MAC 36 (SC) and followed in Shashikala & another -Vs- Gangalakshmamana & another , 2015 (1) TN MAC 785 (SC) it has held that “Loss of consortium is usually for loss for spouse’s affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations for future years and in such circumstances, Courts to award at least Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation for Loss of Consortium” and this position followed in Reliance General Insurance Co Ltd -Vs-K.Meena & others, 2015 (2) TNMAC 449 .

However, a small amount of Rs.1,00,000/- is considered in the lumpsum calculation towards love and affection. Funeral Expenses : 18. Decent burial is also one on the right under Art 21 of our constitution, The petitioner has failed to produced any expenditure statement relating to the funeral expenses, so the tribunal has awarded a minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- for the head, also relied the Judgment in Rajesh v. Rajbir singh [CDJ 2013 SC 485], the Hon’ble apex court has further held that “ Funeral expenses not only includes fee paid in crematorium or cementary but also includes religious practices and conventions performed on death in family. Hence in absence of any evidence to contrary, minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- to be awarded by Courts towards funeral expenses ”. Hence, a sum of Rs,25,000/- alone was considered and fixed the award in lumpsum manner. 7 19. This Tribunal considered future prospects and 50% of income added towards future prospects. Hence, this Tribunal not awarded any under this head. The petitioners not proved the expenses for transportation expenses and damages to articles. However, this Tribunal awarded Rs. 10,000/- towards transport expenses, and Rs. 2000/- towards damage to clothes and articles. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 17,28,000 2.Loss of consortium ...Rs. 1,00,000 3.Loss of Love & Affection …Rs. 1,00,000 4.Loss of estate ...Rs NIL 5.Funeral expenses ...Rs. 25,000 6.Transport expenses ...Rs. 10,000 7.Damages to cloths and articles ...Rs. 2,000 ------------------------ Total ...

This petition, coming up for final hearing before me, on 22.11.2016 in the presence of Thiru. S. Sundarasan, Advocate for the Petitioners and Thiru M. Raju, counsel for the respondent and on hearing the arguments of both sides and upon perusing the case records and having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court doth delivereth the following: JUDGMENT Facts of the Claim 1. Claim for : Fatal 2. Name of deceased : Sangeetha 3. U/S : Sec. 166 of MV Act. 4. Age of the person dead : 24 years 5. Occupation : Maths & Yoga teacher 6. Income pleaded : Rs.35,000/ - 7. Date of Accident : 05.11.2014 8. Compensation claimed : Rs. 1,00,00,000/- 2. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN CLAIM PETITION:- The petitioners are the legal heirs of the deceased Sangeetha. That on 05.11.2014 at about 16.50 P.M, after vaccination to 3rd petitioner at CMC Hospital, Vellore, while the 1st petitioner and the 2 deceased along with the 3rd petitioner were returning to home, the 1st petitioner rode the two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-23-AU-5414 in slow and careful manner and when they nearing to Hyderpuram bus stop turning, the driver of the Respondent's bus drove the bus bearing Reg.No. TN-23-N-1805 in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler and so that the deceased fell down on right side and the 1st petitioner fell down on left side and the right rear wheel of the bus run over the deceased and immediately she has been taken to hospital, but the Doctors declared that she has been already died. The K.V. Kuppam P olice have registered a case in Cr. No. 396/2014, u/s. 279 & 304(A) of IPC. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and working as Maths and Yoga Teacher in private school at Chennai and get salary of Rs.35,000/- per month. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners entire future life is fully doomed. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming compensation of Rs.1,00,00,000/-. 3. THE MATERIAL FACTS STATED IN COUNTER FOR THE RESPONDENT:- The respondent denied the age, income, occupation of the deceased. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated. This Respondent denied the accident. This Respondent's driver drove the bus with due care and caution observing traffic rules and he has not drove the bus in rash and negligent manner at the time of accident. There was no accident as pleaded by the petitioners and false case was registered against the Respondent's bus. The accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent act of the 1st petitioner and this claim application is not maintainable for want of Non-Joinder of owner and insurance company of the two wheeler. The petitioners are not dependent of the deceased and not entitled for compensation. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the respondent ? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner examined as PW1 and Ex.P1 to Ex.P19 marked. Mr.Babu, the Respondent's driver examined as RW1. No documents marked for Respondent. 3 POINT NO.1 6. It is admitted fact the Respondent is the owner of the bus bearing Regd.No. TN- 25-N-1805 and R.W.1 drove the bus on 5.11.2014 at the time of accident. The petitioners contended the accident was happened only due to rash and negligent driving of the Respondent's driver. But, the Respondent contended that the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st petitioner. The M.V.I inspected the offending bus and issued Ex.P.6 vehicle inspection report and wherein it is mentioned the tyre condition was satisfactory and the breaking system was in order and there was no mechanical defect in the vehicle and also noted the damages at right side body. The damages in the bus proved the involvement of the vehicle in accident. Since there was no mechanical defect in the Respondent's vehicle, we have to decide whether the Respondent's driver was responsible for the accident. 7. The P.W. 1 deposed that on 5.11.2014 they have vaccinated to the 3rd petitioner at CMC Hospital, Vellore, and they returned to home through two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-23-AU-5414, and the PW1 ride the two wheeler in a slow and careful manner on the left side of the road, when they nearing to Hyderpuram bus stop turning, the Respondent's driver drove the bus in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler and so that the deceased fell down on right side and the 1st petitioner fell down on left side and the right rear wheel of the bus run over the deceased. The accident was reported to K.V. Kuppam police station and they have registered a case in Cr.No. 396/2014 for offence u/s 279, 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P1 and wherein it also it is clearly stated the Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler and caused accident. After investigation police has filed charge sheet against the Respondent driver and this fact proved through the Ex.P3 copy of charge sheet and the case is still pending. The PW1 admitted that at the place of accident all vehicles go slowly and it shows the PW1 also ride the two wheeler in a slow manner. The PW1 evidence proved the RW1 drove the bus in negligent manner and caused accident. The police investigation also confirmed the accident was caused due to the rash and negligeny act of the RW1. Hence it is decided the Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in negligent manner and caused accident. 4 Point No.2: 8. The 1st petitioner is the husband, 2nd and 3rd petitioners are minor son and daughter of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P4 legal heirship certificate. The PW1 deposed the right side rear wheel of the bus run over the deceased and immediately taken to hospital, but Doctors declared that she was already died. The Ex.P2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein noted the following External Injuries:- 1. Fracture of shaft of left humerus present about 4x2x1 cm laceration present in the occipital region. Chest wall is deformed on the left side with fracture of ribs. Small bowels seen eviscerated through the vaginal vault. The Doctor also noted the following Internal Injuries:- 1. Ribs fractured on left side of rib cage. 2. Liver shattered and avulsed from the interior venacara. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died due to injury to Liver. 9. It is already decided the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of Respondent's driver. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in accident. Hence, the Respondent is liable to pay compensation to the claimants. AGE 10. The age of deceased mentioned as 24 years in claim application. The Ex.P7 is the 10th mark sheet and wherein the date of birth of deceased was mentioned as 29.06.1990 and it proved the deceased crossed 24 years and the age 25 is running. Hence the age of deceased was fixed as 25 years at the time of accident. INCOME 11. The petitioners claimed Rs.1,00,00,000/- as compensation for the death of Sangeetha. It is stated the deceased was working as a Maths and Yoga teacher at private school at Chennai. The petitioners not produced document showing the employment and salary details. Hence it is decided the deceased was unemployed at the time of accident. 12. The Ex.P8 is the B.Sc, decree certificate. The Ex.P9 is the B.Ed., decree certificate. The Ex.P10 is the Diploma in Yoga certificate. The Ex.P11 is the Spoken 5 English course certificate. The Ex.P12 to P14 are sports certificate. The Ex.P15 is the Group song certificate. The Ex.P16 is the certificate of Proficiency in Cultural. The Ex.P17 is the certificate for attending national seminar. The Ex.P18 is the certificate for attending Special camp. The Ex.P19 is the certificate issued for completion of kayakalpa Yoga training. The perusal of Ex.P9 to 19 proved the deceased was multi talented person. The petitioner counsel placed the ruling reported in New India Assurance Co. Ltd -Vs- Govindammal, 2016(1)TNMAC 145, and Bajaj Alliance General Insurance Co Ltd -Vs- Konappan, 2016(1) TNMAC. In the above ruling it is decided the income of the B.Ed, graduate at Rs. 8,000/- and this Tribunal sincerely followed the above rulings and fixed the notional income of the deceased is Rs. 8,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 13. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. Recently in a ruling reported in in Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (2) TNMAC 55(SC): 2013 (9) SCC 54 , it was decided future prospects applicable in a case of self-employed persons also. The annual income of the deceased was Rs.8,000x12=96,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased was 25 years at the time of accident, 50% of income added towards future prospects and the annual income arrived to Rs. 96000+48000=144000/-. Deductions: 14. The deceased was married person at the time of accident. There are 3 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs.

After 1/3rd deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs. 144000 – 48000 = 96,000/- per annum. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 15. Considering the age of the deceased is 25 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 18 is adopted for calculation of 6 compensation. Therefore the compensation calculated to Rs.96000x18 =Rs.17,28,000/- and therefore the petitioner is entitled Rs.17,28,000/- as compensation towards loss of income.

The petitioners are not dependent of the deceased and not entitled for compensation. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the respondent ? 2. Whether the claimants are entitled for compensation, if so, what is the quantum of compensation amount? 5. The 1st petitioner examined as PW1 and Ex.P1 to Ex.P19 marked. Mr.Babu, the Respondent's driver examined as RW1. No documents marked for Respondent. 3 POINT NO.1 6. It is admitted fact the Respondent is the owner of the bus bearing Regd.No. TN- 25-N-1805 and R.W.1 drove the bus on 5.11.2014 at the time of accident. The petitioners contended the accident was happened only due to rash and negligent driving of the Respondent's driver. But, the Respondent contended that the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st petitioner. The M.V.I inspected the offending bus and issued Ex.P.6 vehicle inspection report and wherein it is mentioned the tyre condition was satisfactory and the breaking system was in order and there was no mechanical defect in the vehicle and also noted the damages at right side body. The damages in the bus proved the involvement of the vehicle in accident. Since there was no mechanical defect in the Respondent's vehicle, we have to decide whether the Respondent's driver was responsible for the accident. 7. The P.W. 1 deposed that on 5.11.2014 they have vaccinated to the 3rd petitioner at CMC Hospital, Vellore, and they returned to home through two wheeler bearing Reg.No. TN-23-AU-5414, and the PW1 ride the two wheeler in a slow and careful manner on the left side of the road, when they nearing to Hyderpuram bus stop turning, the Respondent's driver drove the bus in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler and so that the deceased fell down on right side and the 1st petitioner fell down on left side and the right rear wheel of the bus run over the deceased. The accident was reported to K.V. Kuppam police station and they have registered a case in Cr.No. 396/2014 for offence u/s 279, 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P1 and wherein it also it is clearly stated the Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the two wheeler and caused accident. After investigation police has filed charge sheet against the Respondent driver and this fact proved through the Ex.P3 copy of charge sheet and the case is still pending. The PW1 admitted that at the place of accident all vehicles go slowly and it shows the PW1 also ride the two wheeler in a slow manner. The PW1 evidence proved the RW1 drove the bus in negligent manner and caused accident. The police investigation also confirmed the accident was caused due to the rash and negligeny act of the RW1. Hence it is decided the Respondent's driver drove the vehicle in negligent manner and caused accident. 4 Point No.2: 8. The 1st petitioner is the husband, 2nd and 3rd petitioners are minor son and daughter of the deceased and this fact was proved through Ex.P4 legal heirship certificate. The PW1 deposed the right side rear wheel of the bus run over the deceased and immediately taken to hospital, but Doctors declared that she was already died. The Ex.P2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased and wherein noted the following External Injuries:- 1. Fracture of shaft of left humerus present about 4x2x1 cm laceration present in the occipital region. Chest wall is deformed on the left side with fracture of ribs. Small bowels seen eviscerated through the vaginal vault. The Doctor also noted the following Internal Injuries:- 1. Ribs fractured on left side of rib cage. 2. Liver shattered and avulsed from the interior venacara. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died due to injury to Liver. 9. It is already decided the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of Respondent's driver. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the injuries sustained in accident. Hence, the Respondent is liable to pay compensation to the claimants. AGE 10. The age of deceased mentioned as 24 years in claim application. The Ex.P7 is the 10th mark sheet and wherein the date of birth of deceased was mentioned as 29.06.1990 and it proved the deceased crossed 24 years and the age 25 is running. Hence the age of deceased was fixed as 25 years at the time of accident. INCOME 11. The petitioners claimed Rs.1,00,00,000/- as compensation for the death of Sangeetha. It is stated the deceased was working as a Maths and Yoga teacher at private school at Chennai. The petitioners not produced document showing the employment and salary details. Hence it is decided the deceased was unemployed at the time of accident. 12. The Ex.P8 is the B.Sc, decree certificate. The Ex.P9 is the B.Ed., decree certificate. The Ex.P10 is the Diploma in Yoga certificate. The Ex.P11 is the Spoken 5 English course certificate. The Ex.P12 to P14 are sports certificate. The Ex.P15 is the Group song certificate.

The Ex.P19 is the certificate issued for completion of kayakalpa Yoga training. The perusal of Ex.P9 to 19 proved the deceased was multi talented person. The petitioner counsel placed the ruling reported in New India Assurance Co. Ltd -Vs- Govindammal, 2016(1)TNMAC 145, and Bajaj Alliance General Insurance Co Ltd -Vs- Konappan, 2016(1) TNMAC. In the above ruling it is decided the income of the B.Ed, graduate at Rs. 8,000/- and this Tribunal sincerely followed the above rulings and fixed the notional income of the deceased is Rs. 8,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 13. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. Recently in a ruling reported in in Rajesh and others v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (2) TNMAC 55(SC): 2013 (9) SCC 54 , it was decided future prospects applicable in a case of self-employed persons also. The annual income of the deceased was Rs.8,000x12=96,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased was 25 years at the time of accident, 50% of income added towards future prospects and the annual income arrived to Rs. 96000+48000=144000/-. Deductions: 14. The deceased was married person at the time of accident. There are 3 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/3rd of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/3rd deduction the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs. 144000 – 48000 = 96,000/- per annum. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 15. Considering the age of the deceased is 25 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 18 is adopted for calculation of 6 compensation. Therefore the compensation calculated to Rs.96000x18 =Rs.17,28,000/- and therefore the petitioner is entitled Rs.17,28,000/- as compensation towards loss of income. COMPENSATION FOR CONSORTIUM AND LOVE AND AFFECTION CONSORTIUM 16. In Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2009 (2) TN MAC 36 (SC) and followed in Shashikala & another -Vs- Gangalakshmamana & another , 2015 (1) TN MAC 785 (SC) it has held that “Loss of consortium is usually for loss for spouse’s affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations for future years and in such circumstances, Courts to award at least Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation for Loss of Consortium” and this position followed in Reliance General Insurance Co Ltd -Vs-K.Meena & others, 2015 (2) TNMAC 449 .

The petitioners are the husband, son and daughter of the deceased and they have lost their love & affection of the deceased and it is not measurable by money. However, a small amount of Rs.1,00,000/- is considered in the lumpsum calculation towards love and affection. Funeral Expenses : 18. Decent burial is also one on the right under Art 21 of our constitution, The petitioner has failed to produced any expenditure statement relating to the funeral expenses, so the tribunal has awarded a minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- for the head, also relied the Judgment in Rajesh v. Rajbir singh [CDJ 2013 SC 485], the Hon’ble apex court has further held that “ Funeral expenses not only includes fee paid in crematorium or cementary but also includes religious practices and conventions performed on death in family. Hence in absence of any evidence to contrary, minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- to be awarded by Courts towards funeral expenses ”. Hence, a sum of Rs,25,000/- alone was considered and fixed the award in lumpsum manner. 7 19. This Tribunal considered future prospects and 50% of income added towards future prospects. Hence, this Tribunal not awarded any under this head. The petitioners not proved the expenses for transportation expenses and damages to articles. However, this Tribunal awarded Rs. 10,000/- towards transport expenses, and Rs. 2000/- towards damage to clothes and articles.

In the accident, the petitioner in MCOP Nos. 299/2015, 300/2015 and 301/2015 were sustained grievous injury and immediately they rushed to Government Hospital, Gudiyatham and took treatment. The accident was reported to Gudiyatham Town police station and they have registered case in Cr.No.748/2014 for offence u/s. 279, 337 and 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and wherein it was stated the 1st Respondent's driver drove the bus in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the Asta Car bearing Reg.No. AP-03-BG-6619 and caused the accident.

The 1st Respondent contended the car in which the deceased travelled also contributed negligence to the accident. The deceased was travelling as a passenger and hence contributory negligence can not be pleaded against her. The RW.1 is the driver of the offending vehicle at the time of accident and deposed that he drove the bus on the leftern side of the road and at that time the car came in the opposite direction and the car overtake the TATA Ace mini lorry which was coming in front of the car and hence the car dashed on the right side of the bus. RW1 admitted that the FIR was registered against him. The Manager of 1st respondent corporation examined as RW2 and he deposed in cross examination that departmental enquiry was initiated against RW1 and it was pending. On the other hand, the P.W.1 to P.W.3 clearly and cogently deposed that the 1st Respondent's driver drove the bus in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the Asta car. Hence, it is decided the driver of the 1st Respondent is responsible for the accident. 6 POINT NO.2 :- (MCOP NO. 297/2015) 9. The petitioners are the son and daughter of the deceased Yesothammal and this fact was proved through the Ex.P4 legal heir certificate. In pending enquiry, the 2nd petitioner died.

It is already decided the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased Yesothammal was died only due to the injuries sustained in the accident. AGE 11. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased Yesothammal was mentioned as 70 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report also the age of deceased was recorded as 70 years. The petitioner not produced any document for the correct age of deceased Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof for Yesothammal, the approximate age recorded in Ex.P. 2 Postmortem Certificate treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only. Hence, the age of the deceased is fixed as 70 years at the time of accident. INCOME 12. The petitioner claimed Rs. 10,00,000/- as compensation for the death of his mother Yesothammal. It is stated the deceased was doing coolie work and earned Rs. 7,500/- per month. There was no evidence to prove income of deceased. The Yesothammal was house wife and in the absence of income proof, as per the settled position of law, the income of deceased Yesothammal could be taken as Rs.3,500/- P.M. 7 FUTURE PROSPECTS 13. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546 , the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary, to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. The deceased was 70 years old at the time accident, future prospects not applicable for this case. Deductions: 14. In pending enquiry the 2nd petitioner died and hence there is one claimant. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/3rd of salary towards personal and living expenses of income of deceased Yesothammal. After 1/3rd deduction the monthly income was Rs. 3,500x1/3% = 2333/-, rounded to Rs. 2340/-. 15. Considering the age of the deceased was 70 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 5 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, the loss of income for the death of Yesothammal decided to Rs.2340x12x5 = 1,40,400/-. 16. The petitioners totally claimed Rs.9,00,000/- towards loss of earning, transport to hospital, extra nourishment and damages to cloths and articles and claimed totally Rs.1,00,000/- towards funeral expenses, mental shock and agony, loss of expectation of life, loss of love and affection and loss of estate, but they have not filed any proof. However, for funeral expenses, this tribunal is awarded Rs. 10,000/- and Rs.10,000/- is awarded towards loss of love and affection. Since loss of income is considered, this tribunal not awarded any under the head of mental shock and agony, loss of expectation of life, loss of estate. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 1,40,400.00 2.Funeral Expenses ...Rs. 10,000.00 3.Love and affection ...Rs. 10,000.00 ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 1,60,400.00 ------------------------ 8 POINT NO.3 :- (MCOP NO. 299/2015) 17.

The Points : 1.Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent ? 2.Whether the petitioners in MCOP 297/2015/2013 are entitled for compensation? if so, how much? 3.Whether the petitioner in MCOP 299/2015 is entitled for compensation? if so, how much? 4.Whether the petitioner in MCOP 300/2015 is entitled for compensation? if so, how much? 5.Whether the petitioner in MCOP 301/2015 is entitled for compensation? if so, how much? 6.

According to the petitioners that on 14.11.2014 at about 11.15 Hours while the deceased Yasodhammal, the deceased in MCOP 297/2015 and the petitioners in MCOP Nos. 299/2015 and 300/2015 were traveled as occupants of the Hyundai Asta Car bearing Reg.No. AP-03-BG-6619 from Vellore to KGF and the said Car was driven by M.Reddeppa Naidu, the petitioner in MCOP 301/2015 at normal speed at most caution on the extreme left side of the Pallikonda to Gudiyatham road, near Railway station Bridge up stair Gudiyatham, the KSRTC Bus bearing Reg.No. KA-07-F-1482, driven by its driver from Gudiyatham, in a rash and negligent manner hit and dashed against the Hyundai Asta Car and TATA ACE vehemently and due to the strong hit, the deceased Yasodammal sustained fatal injuries and died on the spot. In the accident, the petitioner in MCOP Nos. 299/2015, 300/2015 and 301/2015 were sustained grievous injury and immediately they rushed to Government Hospital, Gudiyatham and took treatment. The accident was reported to Gudiyatham Town police station and they have registered case in Cr.No.748/2014 for offence u/s. 279, 337 and 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and wherein it was stated the 1st Respondent's driver drove the bus in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the Asta Car bearing Reg.No. AP-03-BG-6619 and caused the accident. The Asta Car was driven by the PW3 and the P.W.1 and P.W.2 travelled in the said car at the time of accident and they have deposed the 1st respondent driver drove the bus in a rash and negligent manner from opposite direction and dashed against the Asta car. 8. The 1st Respondent contended the car in which the deceased travelled also contributed negligence to the accident. The deceased was travelling as a passenger and hence contributory negligence can not be pleaded against her. The RW.1 is the driver of the offending vehicle at the time of accident and deposed that he drove the bus on the leftern side of the road and at that time the car came in the opposite direction and the car overtake the TATA Ace mini lorry which was coming in front of the car and hence the car dashed on the right side of the bus. RW1 admitted that the FIR was registered against him. The Manager of 1st respondent corporation examined as RW2 and he deposed in cross examination that departmental enquiry was initiated against RW1 and it was pending. On the other hand, the P.W.1 to P.W.3 clearly and cogently deposed that the 1st Respondent's driver drove the bus in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the Asta car. Hence, it is decided the driver of the 1st Respondent is responsible for the accident. 6 POINT NO.2 :- (MCOP NO. 297/2015) 9. The petitioners are the son and daughter of the deceased Yesothammal and this fact was proved through the Ex.P4 legal heir certificate. In pending enquiry, the 2nd petitioner died. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased Yesothammal and wherein noted the following External Injuries:- 1. Open communited fracture of frontal bone extending to right tempero parietal bone. Part of brain is missing 2. Right side of face is crushed along with right eye. 3.

Undisplaced fracture of 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th ribs on right side and 2nd, 3rd and 5th ribs on left side. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died due to injury to the vital organ of brain. 10. It is already decided the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased Yesothammal was died only due to the injuries sustained in the accident. AGE 11. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased Yesothammal was mentioned as 70 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report also the age of deceased was recorded as 70 years. The petitioner not produced any document for the correct age of deceased Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof for Yesothammal, the approximate age recorded in Ex.P. 2 Postmortem Certificate treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only. Hence, the age of the deceased is fixed as 70 years at the time of accident. INCOME 12. The petitioner claimed Rs. 10,00,000/- as compensation for the death of his mother Yesothammal. It is stated the deceased was doing coolie work and earned Rs. 7,500/- per month. There was no evidence to prove income of deceased. The Yesothammal was house wife and in the absence of income proof, as per the settled position of law, the income of deceased Yesothammal could be taken as Rs.3,500/- P.M. 7 FUTURE PROSPECTS 13. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546 , the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary, to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. The deceased was 70 years old at the time accident, future prospects not applicable for this case. Deductions: 14. In pending enquiry the 2nd petitioner died and hence there is one claimant. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/3rd of salary towards personal and living expenses of income of deceased Yesothammal. After 1/3rd deduction the monthly income was Rs. 3,500x1/3% = 2333/-, rounded to Rs. 2340/-. 15. Considering the age of the deceased was 70 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 5 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, the loss of income for the death of Yesothammal decided to Rs.2340x12x5 = 1,40,400/-. 16. The petitioners totally claimed Rs.9,00,000/- towards loss of earning, transport to hospital, extra nourishment and damages to cloths and articles and claimed totally Rs.1,00,000/- towards funeral expenses, mental shock and agony, loss of expectation of life, loss of love and affection and loss of estate, but they have not filed any proof. However, for funeral expenses, this tribunal is awarded Rs. 10,000/- and Rs.10,000/- is awarded towards loss of love and affection. Since loss of income is considered, this tribunal not awarded any under the head of mental shock and agony, loss of expectation of life, loss of estate. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 1,40,400.00 2.Funeral Expenses ...Rs. 10,000.00 3.Love and affection ...Rs. 10,000.00 ------------------------ Total ...

The petition is bad for non joinder of necessary party i.e. the drivers of the KSRTC Bus as well as the Hyundai Car. The amount claimed is excessive. 5. The Points : 1.Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent ? 2.Whether the petitioners in MCOP 297/2015/2013 are entitled for compensation? if so, how much? 3.Whether the petitioner in MCOP 299/2015 is entitled for compensation? if so, how much? 4.Whether the petitioner in MCOP 300/2015 is entitled for compensation? if so, how much? 5.Whether the petitioner in MCOP 301/2015 is entitled for compensation? if so, how much? 6.

The admitted facts are the 1st respondent is the owner of the vehicle bearing Reg.No. KA-07-F-1482 involved in road accident happened on 14.11.2014 and the RW1 5 was driving the vehicle at the time of accident. According to the petitioners that on 14.11.2014 at about 11.15 Hours while the deceased Yasodhammal, the deceased in MCOP 297/2015 and the petitioners in MCOP Nos. 299/2015 and 300/2015 were traveled as occupants of the Hyundai Asta Car bearing Reg.No. AP-03-BG-6619 from Vellore to KGF and the said Car was driven by M.Reddeppa Naidu, the petitioner in MCOP 301/2015 at normal speed at most caution on the extreme left side of the Pallikonda to Gudiyatham road, near Railway station Bridge up stair Gudiyatham, the KSRTC Bus bearing Reg.No. KA-07-F-1482, driven by its driver from Gudiyatham, in a rash and negligent manner hit and dashed against the Hyundai Asta Car and TATA ACE vehemently and due to the strong hit, the deceased Yasodammal sustained fatal injuries and died on the spot. In the accident, the petitioner in MCOP Nos. 299/2015, 300/2015 and 301/2015 were sustained grievous injury and immediately they rushed to Government Hospital, Gudiyatham and took treatment. The accident was reported to Gudiyatham Town police station and they have registered case in Cr.No.748/2014 for offence u/s. 279, 337 and 304(A) IPC and the copy of the FIR marked as Ex.P.1 and wherein it was stated the 1st Respondent's driver drove the bus in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the Asta Car bearing Reg.No. AP-03-BG-6619 and caused the accident. The Asta Car was driven by the PW3 and the P.W.1 and P.W.2 travelled in the said car at the time of accident and they have deposed the 1st respondent driver drove the bus in a rash and negligent manner from opposite direction and dashed against the Asta car. 8. The 1st Respondent contended the car in which the deceased travelled also contributed negligence to the accident. The deceased was travelling as a passenger and hence contributory negligence can not be pleaded against her. The RW.1 is the driver of the offending vehicle at the time of accident and deposed that he drove the bus on the leftern side of the road and at that time the car came in the opposite direction and the car overtake the TATA Ace mini lorry which was coming in front of the car and hence the car dashed on the right side of the bus. RW1 admitted that the FIR was registered against him. The Manager of 1st respondent corporation examined as RW2 and he deposed in cross examination that departmental enquiry was initiated against RW1 and it was pending. On the other hand, the P.W.1 to P.W.3 clearly and cogently deposed that the 1st Respondent's driver drove the bus in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the Asta car. Hence, it is decided the driver of the 1st Respondent is responsible for the accident. 6 POINT NO.2 :- (MCOP NO. 297/2015) 9. The petitioners are the son and daughter of the deceased Yesothammal and this fact was proved through the Ex.P4 legal heir certificate. In pending enquiry, the 2nd petitioner died. The Ex.P.2 is the copy of postmortem certificate of deceased Yesothammal and wherein noted the following External Injuries:- 1. Open communited fracture of frontal bone extending to right tempero parietal bone. Part of brain is missing 2. Right side of face is crushed along with right eye. 3. Abrasion of 4x3 cm near right forearm. 4. Both bone fracture of right forearm at its lower 1/3rd. 5. Abrasion of 5x4 cm over right thigh. The Doctor also noted the following internal injuries: 1. Undisplaced fracture of 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th ribs on right side and 2nd, 3rd and 5th ribs on left side. The Doctor opined the deceased would appear to have died due to injury to the vital organ of brain. 10. It is already decided the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of 1st Respondent's driver. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased Yesothammal was died only due to the injuries sustained in the accident. AGE 11. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased Yesothammal was mentioned as 70 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report also the age of deceased was recorded as 70 years. The petitioner not produced any document for the correct age of deceased Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof for Yesothammal, the approximate age recorded in Ex.P. 2 Postmortem Certificate treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only. Hence, the age of the deceased is fixed as 70 years at the time of accident. INCOME 12. The petitioner claimed Rs. 10,00,000/- as compensation for the death of his mother Yesothammal. It is stated the deceased was doing coolie work and earned Rs. 7,500/- per month. There was no evidence to prove income of deceased. The Yesothammal was house wife and in the absence of income proof, as per the settled position of law, the income of deceased Yesothammal could be taken as Rs.3,500/- P.M. 7 FUTURE PROSPECTS 13. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546 , the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary, to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. The deceased was 70 years old at the time accident, future prospects not applicable for this case. Deductions: 14. In pending enquiry the 2nd petitioner died and hence there is one claimant. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/3rd of salary towards personal and living expenses of income of deceased Yesothammal. After 1/3rd deduction the monthly income was Rs. 3,500x1/3% = 2333/-, rounded to Rs. 2340/-. 15. Considering the age of the deceased was 70 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 5 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, the loss of income for the death of Yesothammal decided to Rs.2340x12x5 = 1,40,400/-. 16. The petitioners totally claimed Rs.9,00,000/- towards loss of earning, transport to hospital, extra nourishment and damages to cloths and articles and claimed totally Rs.1,00,000/- towards funeral expenses, mental shock and agony, loss of expectation of life, loss of love and affection and loss of estate, but they have not filed any proof. However, for funeral expenses, this tribunal is awarded Rs. 10,000/- and Rs.10,000/- is awarded towards loss of love and affection. Since loss of income is considered, this tribunal not awarded any under the head of mental shock and agony, loss of expectation of life, loss of estate. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 1,40,400.00 2.Funeral Expenses ...Rs. 10,000.00 3.Love and affection ...Rs. 10,000.00 ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 1,60,400.00 ------------------------ 8 POINT NO.3 :- (MCOP NO. 299/2015) 17. Ex.P5 is the certified copy of the Wound certificate issued by the Government Hospital, Gudiyatham to show that the petitioner sustained injuries and the doctor opined that the injuries are simple in nature. We therefore find from the above material and oral evidence that the petitioner has sustained simple injuries on account of the accident and is therefore entitled for compensation. Since the petitioner sustained simple injury, a sum of Rs.20,000/- is allowed towards pain and suffering and medical expenses. POINT NO.4 :- (MCOP NO. 300/2015) 18. Ex.P8 is the certified copy of the Wound certificate issued by the Government Hospital, Gudiyatham to show that the petitioner sustained injuries and the doctor opined that the injuries are simple in nature.

Ex.P9 is the certified copy of the Wound certificate issued by the Government Hospital, Gudiyatham to show that the petitioner sustained injuries and the doctor opined that the injuries are simple in nature.

No. TN-23-AV-6541, owned by the respondent, ridden by its rider in a rash and negligent manner from Vellore to Kagithapattarai and dashed behind the deceased and as a result of the accident, the deceased was sustained fatal injuries and died instantaneously. The accident was reported to Vellore North P olice and they have registered a case in Cr. No. 257/2014, u/s. 279, 304(A) of IPC against the rider of the two wheeler. Prior to the accident, the deceased was hale and healthy and working as a mason and also running evening tiffin shop and earned Rs. 25,000/- per month. He is only the bread winner of the family. Due to the sudden demise, the petitioners have suffered shock, pain, mental agony, loss of company and loss of income. The wife of the deceased is pre-deceased to him. They have no children. The deceased was taking shelter under the petitioners 1 and 2. Hence, the petitioners have filed this petition claiming Rs.15,00,000/- as compensation. 3. The respondent remained absent and set exparte. 4. The Points : 1. Whether the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent riding of the rider of the respondent? 2.

No oral and documentary evidence were let in on the side of the respondent. POINT NO.1: 6. According to the petitioners, that on 16.06.2014 at 3.45 P.M, while the deceased Govindaraj was standing in the extreme left side of the road nearby Uzhavar santhai, Kagithapattarai, at Vellore, the bike bearing Reg. No. TN-23-AV-6541, ridden by its rider in a rash and negligent manner from Vellore to Kagithapattarai and dashed behind the 3 deceased and as a result of the accident, the deceased was sustained fatal injuries and died on the spot. The P.W.1 deposed that the accident was happened due to the rash and negligent ridding of the rider of the respondent. The Ex.P1 is the FIR, wherein also it is stated that the rider of the two wheeler bearing Reg.No.TN-23-AV-6541, ridden the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and dashed against the deceased and after investigation the police have charge sheeted the rider of the two wheeler and this fact was proved through the Ex.P5 certified copy of charge sheet. The offending two wheeler was inspected by the MVI, and issued the Ex.P.4 M.V.I. report stating the accident was occurred not due to mechanical defect. No contra evidence on the side of the respondent to disprove the petitioners' case. Considering the evidence of P.W.1 and the Ex-P1 F.I.R., Ex.P4 MVI report and Ex.P5 charge sheet, it is decided that the accident was only due to the rash and negligent ridding of the rider of the respondent herein. The owner of the vehicle/respondent is vicariously liable for the negligent act of his rider. Hence, the respondent is liable to compensate the petitioners and this point is answered accordingly. Point No.2: 7. According to the petitioners, the petitioners 1, 3 to 6 are the brothers and sisters and the 2nd petitioner is the wife of the 1st petitioner, the 7th and 8th petitioners are the deceased brother Devaraj's son and daughter of the deceased Govindaraj. The Ex.P3 is the legal heirship certificate of the deceased, in which it is seen that the petitioners 1, 3 to 6 are shown as legal heirs of the deceased Govindaraj. Even though it is stated that the deceased was under the shelter of the petitioners 1 and 2, the petitioners have not proved the same by letting evidence and documents. Likewise, the 7th and 8th petitioners are also not shown as the legal heirs of the deceased in Ex.P3 Legal heirs certificate. Therefore, it is decided the petitioners 1, 3 to 6 alone are entitled for compensation for death of the deceased. 8. It is already decided the accident was occurred only due to the rash and negligent riding of the rider of the respondent. The Ex.P.2 postmortem report proved the deceased was died only due to the head injury and its complications. 9. It is stated that at the time of accident, the deceased was aged about 47 years. In Ex-P2 Postmortem Certificate the age of the deceased was mentioned as 48 years. Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximate age recorded in Ex.P.2 Postmortem Certificate treated as the age of deceased person for deciding 4 compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 48 years at the time of accident. INCOME 10. The petitioners claimed Rs.15,00,000/- as compensation for the death of Govindaraj. It is stated the deceased was working as a mason and also running a evening tiffin shop at the time of accident and earned Rs.25,000/- per month. There was no evidence to show the income of the deceased. Considering there was no proof for income of the deceased and considering the age of the deceased, this Tribunal has fixed the monthly income of deceased person as Rs.6,000/- per month. FUTURE PROSPECTS 11. In Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, [2009] 2 SCC 1546, the Hon'ble Supreme Court decided that in case of person has permanent job and below of 40 years, an addition of 50% of actual salary to the actual salary income of the deceased towards future prospects and the addition should be only 30% if the age of the deceased was 40 to 50 years and there should be no addition, where the age of deceased is more than 50 years. The annual income of the deceased was Rs.6,000x12 = 72,000/- and it was not within taxable limit. Considering the age of deceased 30% of income added towards future prospects and the monthly income arrived to Rs. 6000+1800 = 7800/-. Deductions: 12. There are 5 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/4th of the income towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/4th deduction (7800 – 1950 = 5850) the monthly income of the deceased arrived to Rs. 5850/- per month MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 13. Considering the age of the deceased is 48 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 13 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore, the compensation calculated to Rs.5850x12x13=Rs.9,12,600/- and therefore the petitioners are entitled Rs.9,12,600/- as compensation towards loss of income. 5 14. The petitioners claimed Rs. 2000/- towards transport expenses, but not filed any proof, hence not granted. The petitioners claimed Rs.1000/- towards damages to clothing and articles, but not filed any proof, hence not granted. The petitioners claimed Rs.74,000/- towards loss of consortium. Since the wife of the deceased is not one of the claimant and she is pre-deceased to him, hence not granted any under the head of loss of consortium. The petitioners claimed Rs.23,000/- towards funeral expenses, but not filed any proof, however Rs.5,000/- is granted towards funeral expenses. The petitioners claimed Rs.2,00,000/- towards love and affection. The petitioners are the brothers and sisters of the deceased . Hence, a sum of Rs.5,000/- for each petitioner, in total Rs.25,000/- is awarded towards love and affection. The petitioners have claimed Rs.2,00,000/- towards loss of estate, Rs. 9,00,000/- towards loss of earning power. Since this Tribunal considered future prospects and funeral expenses, not awarded any amount under the above heads. The petitioners claimed Rs. 1,00,000/- towards pain and suffering. Since the deceased was died on the spot, not granted. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 9,12,600.00 2.Funeral Expenses ...Rs. 5,000.00 3.Love and affection ...Rs. 25,000.00 ------------------------ Total ... Rs. 9,42,600.00 ------------------------ 15. In the result, this petition is partly allowed with costs and the petitioners 1, 3 to 6 are entitled for Rs.9,42,600/- (Rupees Nine Lakhs Forty two thousand and six hundred only) as compensation . The respondent is directed to pay and deposit the award amount into this court within 4 weeks from this day with interest at 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this petition (25.09.2014) till the date of deposit, excluding the period of default if any.

On perusal of the Ex-P1 F.I.R., it is proved that the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent. Ex.P2 is the Final report in which it is seen that after investigation, the police have filed the final report against the respondent.

In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 74 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report the approximate age of deceased was recorded as 65 years.

As per the ruling reported in Syed Sadiq and others Vs. Divisional Manager United India Insurance Co., Ltd. Reported in 2014 ACJ 627, the claimant was a vegetable vendor who met with an accident in 2008. The Hon'ble Supreme Court assessed income at Rs.6,500/-p.m. Therefore, as per the above ruling, the income of the deceased is fixed at Rs.6,500/- per month for the purpose of calculating compensation. 4 FUTURE PROSPECTS 9. In Sarla Verma Vs.

Anyhow, a small amount of Rs.50,000/- is considered in the lumpsum calculation towards love and affection. Funeral Expenses : 14. Decent burial is also one on the right under Art 21 of our constitution, The petitioners have failed to produce any expenditure statement relating to the funeral expenses, so the tribunal has awarded a minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- for the head, also relied the Judgment in Rajesh v. Rajbir singh [CDJ 2013 SC 485], the Hon’ble apex court has further held that “ Funeral expenses not only includes fee paid in crematorium or cementary but also includes religious practices and conventions performed on death in family. Hence in absence of any evidence to contrary, minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- to be awarded by Courts towards funeral expenses ”. Hence, a sum of Rs,25,000/- alone was considered and fixed the award in lumpsum manner. This Tribunal awarded Rs. 5000/- towards transport expenses, and Rs. 2000/- towards damage to clothes and articles. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 4,36,800.00 2.Loss of consortium ...Rs. 1,00,000.00 3.Love and affection ...Rs. 50,000.00 4.Funeral Expenses ...Rs. 25,000.00 5.Transport Expenses ...Rs. 5,000.00 6.Damages to clothes and articles ...Rs. 2,000.00 ------------------------ Total ...

On perusal of the Ex-P1 F.I.R., it is proved that the accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent. Ex.P2 is the Final report in which it is seen that after investigation, the police have filed the final report against the respondent. Considering the evidence of P.W.2, Ex-P1 F.I.R, and Ex.P2 final report registered against the respondent, it is decided that the accident was only due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent. This point is answered accordingly. Point No.2: 7. The claimants not produced any documentary evidence to prove the correct age of deceased person. In the claim petition, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 74 years. In Ex.P.2 Postmortem report the approximate age of deceased was recorded as 65 years. Considering there was no direct evidence for age proof, approximate age recorded in Ex.P.2 Postmortem Certificate treated as the age of deceased person for deciding compensation purpose only, and the age of the deceased was fixed as 65 years at the time of accident.

As per the ruling reported in Syed Sadiq and others Vs. Divisional Manager United India Insurance Co., Ltd. Reported in 2014 ACJ 627, the claimant was a vegetable vendor who met with an accident in 2008. The Hon'ble Supreme Court assessed income at Rs.6,500/-p.m. Therefore, as per the above ruling, the income of the deceased is fixed at Rs.6,500/- per month for the purpose of calculating compensation. 4 FUTURE PROSPECTS 9.

In the present case, it was already decided that the age of the deceased is 65 years. Therefore, this tribunal has not granted any award under this head. Deductions: 10. There are 8 claimants. As per the dictum laid down in the 2009 (2) TN MAC 1 (SC) Smt. Sarla Varma & others Vs. Delhi Transport corporation & others, this Court deducted 1/5th of salary towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. After 1/5th deduction ( 6500 – 1300 = 5200) the monthly income of the deceased fixed as Rs. 5200/- per month. MULTIPLIER AND LOSS OF INCOME 11. Considering the age of the deceased is 65 years and as per the dictum laid down in Sharla Verma's case, cited supra, the multiplier 7 is adopted for calculation of compensation. Therefore the compensation calculated to Rs.5200x12x7=Rs.4,36,800/- and therefore the petitioners are entitled Rs.4,36,800/- as compensation towards loss of income. COMPENSATION FOR CONSORTIUM AND LOVE AND AFFECTION CONSORTUM 12. In Rajesh v. Rajbir Singh and others, 2009 (2) TN MAC 36 (SC) and followed in Shashikala & another -Vs- Gangalakshmamana & another , 2015 (1) TN MAC 785 (SC) it has held that “Loss of consortium is usually for loss for spouse’s affection, comfort, solace, companionship, society, assistance, protection, care and sexual relations for future years and in such circumstances, Courts to award at least Rs.1,00,000/- as compensation for Loss of Consortium” and this position followed in Reliance General Insurance Co Ltd -Vs-K.Meena & others, 2015 (2) TNMAC 449 .

The petitioners 2 and 8 are sons and daughters of the deceased. They have lost their love & affection of their father, it is not measurable by money. Anyhow, a small amount of Rs.50,000/- is considered in the lumpsum calculation towards love and affection. Funeral Expenses : 14. Decent burial is also one on the right under Art 21 of our constitution, The petitioners have failed to produce any expenditure statement relating to the funeral expenses, so the tribunal has awarded a minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- for the head, also relied the Judgment in Rajesh v. Rajbir singh [CDJ 2013 SC 485], the Hon’ble apex court has further held that “ Funeral expenses not only includes fee paid in crematorium or cementary but also includes religious practices and conventions performed on death in family. Hence in absence of any evidence to contrary, minimum amount of Rs.25,000/- to be awarded by Courts towards funeral expenses ”. Hence, a sum of Rs,25,000/- alone was considered and fixed the award in lumpsum manner. This Tribunal awarded Rs. 5000/- towards transport expenses, and Rs. 2000/- towards damage to clothes and articles. The total compensation is calculated as follows: 1.Loss of Income ...Rs. 4,36,800.00 2.Loss of consortium ...Rs. 1,00,000.00 3.Love and affection ...Rs. 50,000.00 4.Funeral Expenses ...Rs. 25,000.00 5.Transport Expenses ...Rs. 5,000.00 6.Damages to clothes and articles ...Rs. 2,000.00 ------------------------ Total ...

The averments made in the petition are briefly as follows:- On 15.05.2015 at about 2.00 PM the petitioner was proceedings to Kancheepuram in his relative Maxi Cab Van bearing Regn.No.TN-43-C-1932 for purchasing Silk Saree, when the said Maxi Cab Van was coming near JBR Kalyana Mandapam at Madhanur in Ambur to Vellore road, its left side back tyre was burst and the vehicle hit the road center grill divider and thereby the accident taken place. At that time the driver of the van was driving the vehicle with heavy speed in a rash and negligent manner with high speed without blowing horn and applied the break and thereby the petitioner's vehicle hit the road center divider. The accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the Maxi Cab Van bearing Regn.No.TN-43- C-1932. The 1st respondent is the owner of the Maxi Cab Van and the 2nd respondent is the insurer of the said Van. Both are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioner. /3/ 3. The 1st respondent was called absent and set exparte on 26.10.2015. 4. The averments made in the counter filed by the 2 nd respondent is briefly as follows:- This petition is not maintainable either in law or on facts. All the petition averments are denied except those that are specifically admitted by this respondent herein. This respondent submits that there is a barricade on the middle of the National Highway to avoid the accident inspite of that the vehicle in which the petitioner travelled had dashed against the divider and caused the injuries to the petitioner and further stated that the vehicle in which the petitioner travelled was having a permit to carry 12 passengers only whereas it is evident as per the statement of the petitioner there were 22 passengers travelled in the vehicle which is against the permit condition thereby violating the policy condition. The non standard passengers are not entitled to claim compensation as against the respondent. The petitioner can claim compensation and damages as against the owner of the vehicle alone and this respondent is not liable to pay compensation to the petitioner. Compensation claimed by the petitioner is very high. Hence petition is liable to be dismissed. /4/ 4. The point for consideration in this petition are as follows:- (1)Whether this accident has occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent's Maxi Cab Van bearing Regn.No.TN-43-C-1932 ? (2)Who is liable to pay the compensation? (3)Whether the Petitioner is entitled to compensation? and if so, what is the the quantum? 5. On the side of the Petitioner, the petitioner has been examined as P.W.1 and 9 documents have been marked as Ex.P.1 to P.9. On the side of the 2nd Respondent, no witness has been examined and no document has been marked. Hence there is no contra evidence on the side of the respondents. The Court document, Disability Certificate issued by the Joint Director of Medical and Rural Health Services, Vellore is marked as Ex.C1. 6. Point No.1: (i) It is the case of the petitioner that o n 15.05.2015 at about 2.00 PM the petitioner was proceedings to Kancheepuram in his relative Maxi Cab Van bearing Regn.No.TN-43-C-1932 for purchasing Silk Saree, when the said Maxi Cab Van was coming near JBR Kalyana Mandapam at Madhanur in Ambur to Vellore road, its left side back tyre was burst and the vehicle hit the road center grill divider and thereby the accident taken place. At that time the driver of the van was driving the vehicle with heavy speed in a rash and negligent manner with high speed without blowing horn and applied the break /5/ and thereby the petitioner's vehicle hit the road center divider. The accident was happened only due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the Maxi Cab Van bearing Regn.No.TN-43-C-1932. (ii) The petitioner is examined as P.W.1 and she deposed that the accident has occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st respondent's Maxi Cab Van bearing Regn.No.TN-43-C-1932. To prove the case of the petitioner through PW1, the copy of FIR and copy of the MVI Report have been filed as Ex.P.1 and Ex.P.3 . The driver of the 1st Respondent’s Maxi Cab Tourist Van bearing Regn.No.TN-43-C-1932 was shown in the accused column. (iii) The 2nd Respondent has not brought anything contra from the cross examination of PW1 as to the cause of the accident. Even though the 2nd respondent in their counter denied the alleged manner of accident and stated that the there is a barricade on the middle of the National Highway to avoid the accident inspite of that the vehicle in which the petitioner traveled had dashed against the divider and caused the injuries to the petitioner ,but to prove that the accident was not occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the 1st respondent's Maxi Cab Van driver, no documentary or oral evidence produced on the side of the 2nd respondent. Hence, this tribunal decides that since there is no contra evidence available, the accident happened due to the rash and /6/ negligence of the 1st respondent's Maxi Cab Van driver only and further the 1st respondent has not taken any steps to quash the FIR. (iv) Hence, from the oral evidence of P.W.1, and the documentary evidence of Ex.P.1 and Ex.P.3, the FIR copy and the copy of MVI Report and since there is no contra evidence available to disprove the accident, this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the accident has occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the 1st Respondent's Maxi Cab Van bearing Regn.No.TN-43-C-1932. Thus the Point No.(1) is answered accordingly. 7. Point No.2 :- (i) In Point No.(1), it has been found that the accident has occurred due to the rash and negligent d riving of the driver of the 1st Respondent's Maxi Cab Van bearing Regn.No.TN-43-C-1932. (ii)The petitioner in the petition has mentioned that the first respondent's Maxi Cab Van is insured with the second respondent under Policy No.013082/31/14/01/00002763 Valid from 28.08.2014 to 27.08.2015 and filed the copy of the said insurance policy as Ex.P.5. The 2nd respondent did not file any documentary evidence to disprove the accident and also not denied about the policy filed by the petitioner. But in their counter stated that the Maxi Cab Van vehicle in which the petitioner traveled was having a permit to carry 12 /7/ passengers only but there were 22 passengers traveled in the vehicle which is against the permit condition thereby violating the policy condition. To prove that 22 passengers travelled in the Van at the time of accident, the 2nd respondent has not filed any oral or documentary evidence. But on the other hand in the FIR which is marked as Ex.P.1, the complainant stated that she and along with her relatives totally 12 persons travelled in the Van. To disprove the said allegation, there is no oral or documentary evidence filed by the 2nd respondent. Further the petitioner filed the copy of the MVI Report of the Van and the same is marked as Ex.P.3. On perusal of Ex.P.3, it is seen that the driver of the Maxi Cab Van had valid driving licence and there is no mention about the violation of Policy condition. Therefore, it is considered that the said Maxi Cab Van had a valid insurance policy issued by the 2nd respondent at the time of the accident and there is no violation of Policy conditions. Hence, this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the 2nd respondent being the insurer is liable to pay the compensation to the Petitioner. Accordingly, the Point No.(2) is answered. 8. Point No.(3) (i) In this petition, and as P.W.1 in her evidence, the petitioner has stated as to the injuries sustained by her in detail. The Petitioner filed the Treatment Particulars issued in Government Vellore Medical College Hospital, Vellore /8/ and the same is marked as Ex.P.2. As per the Treatment Particulars which is marked as Ex.P.2, the petitioner sustained fracture on her right side 4th and 5th rib and was treated conservatively and she took treatment as inpatient from 15.05.2015 to 17.05.2015 and was discharged at her request. The PW1 has not examined the Doctor who has given treatment to her. The Ex.C1 is the Disability Certificate issued by the Joint Director of Medical and Rural Health Services, Vellore and it shows the disability percentage as 10% . Hence this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the Petitioner has suffered partial disability of 10% and in the Disability Certificate there is no mention that the petitioner has sustained Permanent disability, hence the Petitioner is entitled for compensation for the injuries sustained by her, Rs.3,000/- per percentage is allowed. Hence the Petitioner is entitled for Rs.30,000/- only as just compensation for the injuries sustained by her. (ii) Income of the Petitioner: As far as the income of the injured at the time of the accident is concerned it has been stated in the petition that the petitioner is a Agricultural Cooli and was earning a sum of Rs.6,000/- per month. But to prove the petitioner's avocation and income, no documentary evidence filed. Hence notional income has to be fixed. Hence, considering the age of the petitioner, /9/ the monthly notional income has fixed as Rs.4,000/- per month. Hence, this Tribunal is inclined to fix Rs.4,000/- per month. (iii) Compensation for Pain and Sufferings: The Petitioner has sustained above said injuries and she took treatment in Government Vellore Medical College Hospital, Vellore as in patient from 15.05.201 to 17.05.2015. Hence, this Tribunal considers to award Rs.10,000/- as just compensation under the head of Pain and Sufferings. (iv) Transport Charges: The petitioner took treatment in Government Vellore Medical College Hospital, Vellore . Upon considering the place of occurrence and the hospital where the petitioner took treatment and the place of residence of the petitioner, this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the petitioner is entitled to a sum of Rs.3,000/- towards the head ""Transport to hospital"". (v) Medical Expenses: The petitioner has not filed any Medical Bills for the treatment taken by her. Hence, no amount is awarded towards Medical Expenses. (vi) Extra-nourishment: The Petitioner took treatment in Government Vellore Medical College Hospital, Vellore for 3 days. Hence this Tribunal decides to award Rs.10,000/- towards Extra-nourishment. /10/ (vii) Attender Charges: On perusal of records it is found that t he petitioner took treatment in Government Vellore Medical College Hospital, Vellore for 3 days. Hence she is entitled for attender charges and hence Rs.750/- (3 x Rs.250) is awarded towards Attender Charges. (viii) Loss of Earning : Due to the above said injuries, the Petitioner would have not worked for atleast two months, during the period of treatment and recuperation. Hence this Tribunal is inclined to compensate a sum of Rs.8,000/- towards loss of earning during the period of treatment and recuperation. (ix) Loss of future Prospects: The PW1 has stated that due to the injuries sustained by her , her right side 4th and 5th rib bone got fractured and she is not able to do her work. Hence the petitioner is entitled for any amount towards Loss of future Prospects.
