SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 2 -.- Present:- Shri Akhil Gupta, counsel for the petitioners. Shri Gurmeet Singh, counsel for the respondent No.1 & 2. Shri R. K. Vig, counsel for the respondent No.3. AWARD:- Petitioners have brought t he instant petition 'under Section 166 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, for claiming compensation of Rs.20,00,000/- along with interest @ 18% per annum, on account of death of Sh. Rishi Pal, with loss of love and affection, consortium and loss of livelihood etc, who died in a road side accident which took place on 09.03.2015 at about 8.30 P.M, within the area of Police Station Naraingarh, due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 by Tractor bearing Registration No. PB-23-A-7233 . A case under sections 279, 304-A IPC was registered at Police Station Naraingarh vide FIR No. 52 dated 10.03.2015 against the respondent No.1. The postmortem of dead body was conducted at Civil Hospital Naraingarh. At the time of his death, his age was 42 years and he was earning Rs.25,000/- per month from the agriculture and dairy milk and all claimants being widow, daughter, son and mother were fully dependent upon the income of the deceased. 2The necessary facts relating to accident are that on 09.03.2015, Rishi Pal (since deceased) was going on his motorcycle bearing registration No.HR-04-E-4321 Marka Discover, towards his Village Ganauli and at about 8.30 PM, when he was on its correct side on the road, then just ahead a tractor trolley was going, which was coming SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 3 from Sadhaura to Naraingarh side and its driver was driving his tractor in a in a rash, negligent and zig-zag manner; motorcyclist tried to over take his motorcycle, in the mean time, the driver of the tractor trolley turned his tractor into right side and hit the motorcycle and due to this impact, the motorcyclist received multiple and grievous injuries. This accident was witnessed by Pawan Kumar, who was also proceeding towards the village. After the said accident, motorcyclist was taken to civil Hospital Naraingarh, from where, he was referred to PGI Chandigarh but on the way he died due to the injuries sustained in the accident. The accident took place due to sole rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1/ driver of Tractor bearing Registration No. PB-23-7277. It is further pleaded that deceased was only sole bread earner of his family. Due to his untimely death, claimants No.2 and 3 being daughter and son {who are students} also deprived from the love and affection of their father. After the death of deceased, whole family members have no source of income. The claimants spent more than Rs,50,000/- on funeral and last rites of the deceased. Hence, the instant claim petition without any delay . At the relevant time, the offending vehicle in question was owned by respondent no.2, and was insured with the respondent No.3. 3Upon notice, respondent No.1 and 2 filed written statement controverting the assertions made in the petition. They took preliminary objection qua maintainability. On merits, it is submitted that the alleged accident has not been caused by the respondent, who is having valid SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 4 driving licence and the respondent No.1 is an experienced driver having experience of about 20 years; that false FIR has been registered against the respondent No.1; that if this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the accident was caused by the respondent No.1, then the tractor in question was insured with respondent No.3, who is responsible to pay the compensation. The compensation claimed is highly excessive and the claimants are not entitled to any compensation. Rest of averments raised in the petition are denied and prayed for dismissal of instant claim petition with special costs. 4The respondent No.3 (insurance company) filed separate written statement controverting the assertions made in the petition and took some preliminary objections qua maintainability, cause of action; that the claim petition is bad by the principle of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence, that petition is bad for mis joinder and non joinder of necessary parties; that petition has been filed with malafide intention and in collusion with respondents No.1 and 2 only to extract compensation from the answering respondent; that respondent No.1 was not having valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident and has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy; that respondents No.1 and 2 be directed to produce the original aforesaid documents; that answering respondent takes all the pleas available under sections 147 (2) , 148, 149 (2), 167, 169 & 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act. On merit, it is submitted that the tractor/trolley No. PB-23-A-7577 was never involved in any accident. However, the insurance particular of the SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 5 vehicle in question has not been verified from the issuing authority, so it is not admitted but the liability of insurance company, if any subject to the provisions of the M.V . Act and also terms and conditions thereof. It is denied that deceased suffered multiple grievous injuries and died on 10.03.2015 due to this accident. The amount claimed as compensation is much more exaggerated and imaginary one and they were not dependent upon the income of the deceased. No such accident has taken place. The FIR was registered by manipulating the wrong facts in order to get huge compensation from the answering respondent. The actual cause of accident has been suppressed. The claim petition has been filed after due consultation just to get compensation from the answering respondent on purely made up basis which is not sustainable in the eyes of law. The amount spent on transportation or last rites is also denied. The age and prospective income of the deceased also denied. Rests of facts are denied and prayed for dismissal of claim petition with special costs. 5Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed vide order dated 26.03.2015:- 1Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1 while driving tractor bearing Registration No. PB-23-A-7277 resulting into causing death of Rishi Pal, as alleged? OPP. 2If Issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom, the claimants are entitled to? OPP. 3Whether petition is not maintainable in the present form? OPR. 4Whether the claimants have no cause of action to file SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 6 the present petition ?OPR 5Whether petition is bad by the principles of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence ? OPR 6Whether petition is bad for non joinder and mis joinder of necessary parties? OPR. 7Whether respondent no.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect? OPR. 8Whether respondent no.3 is entitled to take all the defences available to it under the M.V . Act ? OPR. 9Relief. 6 To establish their claim through this inquiry, petitioners examined one of the claimant Smt. Sunita (widow of deceased) as PW1 who tendered affidavit Ex.PW1/A reiterating the averments raised in the petition. In cross-examination, she answered that she is a house hold lady. Her marriage was solemnized with Rishi Pal on 30.11.1993. She was 20 years old at the time of marriage. Her husband was 2 years elder to her. Her children had passed B.A. The date of birth of her children is 31.08.1994. Motorcycle was in the name of her husband. Her husband was having driving licence, but she cannot tell about the issuing authority of the same. She does not know whether her husband was income tax payee or not. They have their own house. She is having Ration card, voter card and Aadhar Card of said address. She has not brought the proof regarding date of birth of her husband. She has not possessed any document regarding income of her husband for Rs.25,000/- by doing agriculture and dairy farming. She is not eye witness. PW2 Kulwinder Singh, Additional Ahlmad, has brought the summoned file and SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 7 produced the documents i.e Statement of Pawan Kumar as Ex.P1, Photo copy of site plan as Ex.P2, Seizure form dated 10.03.2015 as Ex.P3, supplementary statement of Pawan Kumar as Ex.P4, Mechanical report of accidental vehicles as Ex.P5 and Ex.P6, photo copy of postmortem report of Rishi Pal as Ex.P7, attested copy of FIR as Ex.P8. In cross- examination, he answered that original RC of vehicle No. PN-23-A-7277 was already attached with another case file titled as State Vs. Nasib FIR No.133 dated 17.06.2014 under sections 279, 337 and 304-A IPC PS Naraingarh as per report of Criminal Ahlmad dated 12.03.2015. Accused Nasib Singh was arrested and bailed out on 12.03.2015. No DL of Nasib Singh was on the case file as per list of documents attached with the challan. He has no personal knowledge about this case. PW3 Pawan Kumar (Complainant-eye witness of accident) tendered affidavit Ex.PW3/A supporting the version of accident. In cross- examination, he answered that Rishi Pal was his real brother. They both started their journey from Village Ganauli to their village on separate motorcycles. His brother was ahead to him at a distance of 100-150 yards. The road was a single road having 20 feet width. It was dark night and there was no traffic on the road at that time. He was driving motorcycle at the speed of 40 KMPH and his brother was driving his motorcycle at the speed of 45 KMPH. His brother was not overtaking any other vehicle at that time. The tractor trolley was empty. There was no crossing or the chowk near the place of occurrence. His brother had already crossed the half portion of tractor trolley. Self stated the driver of tractor trolley SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 8 suddenly turned his vehicle towards right side. There was no traffic coming from opposite side. Many people had gathered at the spot after the accident. There is a police Naka near the place of occurrence. Police had recorded his statement at Civil Hospital Naraingarh. Self stated police had also recorded his supplementary statement on 10.03.2015. After recording his statement with police he went police station twice in connection with this case. Learned counsel for claimants has also tendered documents i.e copy of Ration card as Ex.P9, copy of Aadhar Card of Sunita as Ex.P10, Copy of Aadhar Card of Smt. Shakuntla as Ex.P11, Copy of Aadhar Card of Abhishek Saini as Ex.P12 and Copy of Aadhar Card of Aanchal Saini as Ex.P13 and closed his evidence. On the other hand, respondents No.1 and 2 have tendered documents i.e copy of DL as Ex.R1, Copy of RC as Ex.R2, Copy of insurance policy as Ex.R3 and closed their evidence, whereas counsel for respondent No.3 has tendered copy of insurance policy as Ex.R4 and closed his evidence. 7I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on various issues are as under: ISSUE NO.1: 8 Under this issue, claimants-petitioners are required to establish fact that motor vehicular accident was occurred 'due to sole rash and negligent driving of Respondent no.1, resulting death of Rishi Pal and as such, they being dependents are entitled to appropriate compensation from SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 9 respondents who are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation amount. 9 Learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that accident in question was taken place due to sole rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1, resulting death of Rishi Pal, therefore, respondent No.1, driver, respondent No.2 owner and respondent no.3 insurer, are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the petitioners and prayed for allowing the petition. 10 On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent no.1&2 has submitted that no such accident, as alleged, was ever taken place with the involvement of offending vehicle, thus, no negligence could be attributed to the respondent No.1, in this view of the matter, no liability can be fastened upon respondent No 1&2 to pay any compensation to the petitioners. He further argued that for the sake of discussion if accident was taken place 'though not admitted, even then Respondent no.1 was holding valid license EX.R1 at the day of alleged accident and offending vehicle was also insured with respondent no.3, therefore, respondent no.3 is liable to indemnify the insured and prayed for dismissal the petition against them. 11 Learned counsel for respondent no.3 has submitted that no such accident, as alleged, was ever taken place with the involvement of offending vehicle, rather, petitioners in collusion with respondent no.1&2 got lodged false and frivolous FIR EX.P8 and so no liability can be fastened upon respondent no.3. He further argued that claimants did not SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 10 disclose the exact date of birth of deceased to claim excess compensation, rather if PW1 was married in the year 1993 and her husband was elder than 2 years, then age of deceased was more than 42 years and prayed for dismissal the petition. 12 I have given due regard to the rival contentions put forth by learned counsel for respective parties and have evaluated entire oral evidence coupled with documentary evidence carefully. After thorough examination, it is observed that the petitioners-claimants have come to the Court with categorical stand that accident was taken place due to rash and negligent driving of Tractor-Trolley No. PB-23-A-7277 Marka HMT-5911 by Respondent No.1, resulting death of Rishi Pal on 10.03.2015. In order to prove this issue, PW3{complainant-eye witness of accident} tendered affidavit Ex.PW3/A stating therein factum of accident. He deposed that he is an agriculturist and they are three brothers and two sisters and all are married. The marriage of their sister's daughter was to be solemnized on 10.3.2015. On 09.3.2015 he along with Rishi Pal was coming on their motorcycle from Todarpur- Sadhaura-fields, after finishing the work to their village Ganauli. At about 8.30 PM, deceased was ahead about 150 Meter and was on his motorcycle and he was plying the motorcycle on normal speed and just ahead a tractor trolley was going in a rash and negligent manner, which was coming from Sadhaura to Naraingarh side and the driver of Tractor No. PB-23-A-7277 Marka HMT-5911 was driving his vehicle in a zig-zag manner and when his brother tried to over- take motorcycle, in the mean time, the driver of the tractor trolley turned SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 11 his tractor into right side and hit the motorcycle of his brother and due to this impact, his brother received multiple and grievous injuries on his person. He further deposed that there was a police barricade {Naka} near to the place of accident and with the help of police officials, his brother was taken to G.H. Naraingarh in a private vehicle and thereafter the driver of tractor trolley stayed for some time and thereafter due to darkness he fled from the spot after leaving the tractor trolley. The doctor of G.H. Naraingarh referred his brother to PGI Chandigarh but on the way to PGI his brother was succumbed to injuries sustained in the accident. He categorically deposed that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1. PW1 Sunita {who is the widow of deceased Rishi Pal} tendered affidavit Ex.PW1/A reiterating the facts relating to question of dependency and income of her husband. PW2 has brought the summoned case file titled as State Vs Nasib Singh bearing FIR No. 52 dated 10.03.2015 under sections 279, 304-A IPC, P.S. Naraingarh. He stated that case is pending on 18.12.2015 for prosecution evidence. PW1 to PW3 were cross examined, however, nothing can be elicited disbelieving factum of motor vehicular accident. 13 It would be relevant to point out here that mere denial of rash and negligence after causing accident resulting death of male member, at the behest of respondents, are not found sufficient at all, rather, if there was no rash and negligent act at behest of driver, then driver/respondent no.1, could easily appear in the witness box to rebut the stand taken by claimants-petitioners. However, no reason has been assigned by the owner SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 12 and insurance company for non-examination of the driver of vehicle. In accident cases, it is necessary to have the first hand report from the driver. It may be that the driver does not always speak the truth, but the driver's version is the one which is to be given the best consideration. He also knows that as to what actually happened and if the driver has not been examined, then an adverse inference must be drawn against him. To that effect, reliance can be placed on ruling Raju and others versus Sukhvinder Singh and others, 2006(4)RCR(civil) 82 (P&H) . 14It is quite well settled that the lodging of the first information report is not an essential prerequisite for claiming compensation arising from a motor accident. Each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The Tribunal is expected to adjudge a case on the basis of the evidence adduced without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled position of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. It must be remembered that in a motor accident claim, the claimants are not required to prove their case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. It is trite law that claimants-petitioners are required to prove its case, which sets up the particular case relating to the accident which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts upon the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way alleged by the claimants. The provisions with regard to claim under the Act are enacted keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 13 vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimants are always entitled for compensation irrespective whether the police has registered the offence regarding the incident or not because no claim case can be left over on the mercy of the police. 15 The evidence proved on record irrefutably leads to the inference in terms of unrebutted evidence at the instance of petitioners that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1, resulting death of Rishi Pal and respondent No.1 has been facing trial under section 279 and 304 A, therefore, in view of case law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993 (2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008 (2) R.C.R. (Civil) 774, it can be safely held that the accident in question took place due to sole rash and negligent driving by respondent No.1. Accordingly, this issue no.1 is decided in favour of the claimants. ISSUE NO. 2: 16The onus to prove this issue is upon claimants. It is undisputed that deceased was married and died leaving behind his wife, one son, one daughter and old aged mother. The deceased was enjoying very good health and physique. Here, PW1 categorically stated that all claimants were fully dependent upon income of deceased but due to untimely death of their only bread earner in his prime age of 42 years, they all have deprived from their source of income and also suffered mental shock and agony. PW1 also stated that they have spent Rs.50,000/- on transportation of dead body and funeral/ last rites of her deceased SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 14 husband. 17 Coming to question of age of deceased; according to postmortem report EX.P7, the age of deceased is shown as 42 years. However, claimants have furnished Adhaar Cards of all claimants as EX.P/10 to EX.P/13 but it is not understandable as to why adhaar card of deceased has not brought on record to show his exact date of birth of deceased. However, in order to surface the truth, claimant's counsel was directed to produce Adhaar Card who tendered the same. Copy of Adhar Card reflects date of birth of deceased as 01.01.1972 and so it can be safely said that age of deceased was between 42-45 years at the time of death and so multiplier of 14 can be applied. 18 Coming to question of income of deceased; though, claimants- petitioners pleaded that deceased was earning Rs.25,000/- per month. If deceased was earning Rs. 25,000/- per month, then, claimants-petitioners were required to produce relevant documents to establish his income, however, claimants-petitioners have entirely failed to establish exact income of deceased and so oral statement of PW1 without supporting any documentary proof of income, is not found sufficient at all. More so, if deceased was working as agriculturist and was doing dairy farming work, even then, his monthly income as a daily wager/ skilled labourer cannot assessed less than Rs.8000/- per month as just compensation. However, agriculture land shall remain as it is and legal heirs shall inherit the same and they can easily earn income from that property. It may not be out of place to mention here that the monetary compensation will never SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 15 be a sufficient succor for victims of accidental cases rather their needs can only be prevented by providing just compensation and it can not be cured. The best manner in which victims can be compensated for sufferings only to prevent recurrence of any such road incident by wrongdoer. In failure to protect or prevent an sufferings of victims due to death of their sole bread earner in road accident, it also imposes liability of state to take extra ordinary precaution to reduce such type of road accident by deputing sufficient traffic police or to comply with strict traffic rules to avoid such incident. It will certainly take lot of time for rehabilitation by the family members of deceased. Apart from this, widow of deceased has no source of income to maintain and to survive herself and family except agricultural land. 19 It would be appropriate to say that parents of deceased are generally entitled to compensation without going into question of dependency and as such income of the deceased Rishi Pal is being taken Rs. 8,000/- per month. He died on 9.3.2015 leaving behind widow aged 41 years {01/01/1974}, Son age below 21 years{31/08/1994} daughter age below 21 years {31/8/1994} and mother aged above 75 years {1/1/1940} and, therefore, they all are taken under his dependency. If four or five persons are dependent upon income of deceased, then 1/4th amount is deducted on account his living and personal expenses. Therefore, by considering the age of deceased between 42 to 45 years, multiplier of 14 is to be applied i n view of Smt. Sarla Verma and Ors. Vs SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 16 Delhi Transport Corporation and another AIR 2009 Supreme Court 3104. By applying multiplier of 14, the exact assessment of compensation would come to {72000x14} Rs. 100,8,000/- . Additionally, petitioners being parents, children and widow have deprived from love and affection and also suffered pain, agony due to untimely death, therefore, they are entitled to Rs.50,000/- in these head. They have also spent amount on last rites/funeral of deceased and so they are entitled to funeral expenses amounting Rs.30,000/-. The petitioner no.1 being widow is also entitled to Rs.50000/- as consortium and in this manner, total compensation is computed to Rs.11,38,000/-- which shall be payable along with interest @ 7.5/- per annum from the date of filing the petition till its realization to the petitioners. Rests of relief sought by petitioners-claimants stands declined. Accordingly, issue no.2 is decided in favour of claimants-petitioners. ISSUE NO.3 to 7 : 20The onus to prove these issues are upon Respondents but they neither pressed these issue nor led any evidence. However, it has already discussed in detail under Issue No.1 & 2 that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. In this way, it has become obvious on file that this tribunal has left with no other option except to decide these issues against Respondents. Accordingly, both these issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.8 : 21 The onus to prove this issue is upon the respondent No.3, who is under the obligation to prove this fact that the respondent No.1 SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 17 was not having a valid driving licence at the time of alleged accident and as such respondent no.2 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy/cover note EX.R4 and so respondent No.3 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimants. However, there is nothing on record to show that respondent No.1 was not holding any valid license, rather same is proved as EX.R1. Further, Insurance Policy Ex.R4 reveals that offending vehicle as per RC EX.R2, was insured with the respondent No.3 at the relevant time. There is nothing brought on record to show that the Driving licence Ex.R1 was invalid at the day of occurrence. In the fact and circumstances, it is quite clear that the respondent no.2 did not violate or breach any covenant and condition of the insurance policy. Accordingly, this Issue is decided against the respondent No.3. ISSUE NO.9 (RELIEF): PETITION SUCCEEDS ; 22 In view of the foregoing discussion, instant claim petition stands allowed with costs in a manner that the claimants-petitioners are held entitled to compensation of Rs.11,38,000/- along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this claim petition till the date of actual payment. The awarded compensation amount along with interest shall be payable jointly and severally by respondent No.1 and respondent no.2 and respondent no.3, shall indemnify the insured. The 1/4 th each share of claimant-petitioner No.2&3 shall be deposited in any nationalized bank in the shape of FDR and shall be payable to them at the time of their marriage. However, claimant-petitioner no.1 being mother shall be at liberty to receive accrued interest on their FDR either quarterly SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 18 or half yearly for their education etc. The ¼th share of petitioner no.4 shall be deposited in FDR for two years in any nationalized bank and shall be payable to her. The balance ¼ share along with additional compensation in the shape of consortium etc shall be payable to the account of claimant-petitioner No. 1 respectively. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.3000/-. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly and file be consigned to records after due compliance. Announced in open Court.

Both the claim petitions have been preferred relating to one accident, out of them, first petition is for grant of compensation of Rs. 30,00,000/- on account of injuries suffered by claimant Sohan Lal and second petition is for grant of compensation of Rs.30,00,000/- on account of injuries suffered by claimant Sahab Singh, i n motor vehicular accident on 30.10.2014, which was allegedly caused due to rash and negligent driving of Truck bearing Registration No. HR-37-A-7707 by Janak Raj respondent No.1. At the relevant time, the vehicle in question was owned by the respondent no. 1 and was insured with the respondent no.2. 2The relevant facts leading to the claim petitions are that on 30.10.2014, Sohan Lal along with pillion riders Sahab Singh and Suresh SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 3 Kumar were going from Grain Market Ambala, to the house in village Saunti, while driving Motorcycle at slow speed and on the left side of the road. At about 10.00 PM, when they had gone little ahead from Thol Chowk, in the mean time, a truck bearing registration No. HR-37-A-7707 came at fast speed from Ismailabad side and while it was in the process of over taking, a canter came on the wrong side of the road and struck against their motorcycle. The truck was being driven by its driver at fast speed and in a rash and negligent manner by respondent No.1, resulting into causing serious injuries to claimant and others. They were taken to Government Hospital Ambala, from where both the claimants were referred to PGI Chandigarh. After causing the accident, respondent No.1 ran away from the side of accident leaving his truck at the spot. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing registration No. HR-37-A-7707 by respondent No.1. First claimant- Injured Sohan Lal remained admitted in PGI from 30.10.2014 to 08.12.2014 and has become permanently disabled. He spent Rs. three lac on his treatment and has spent Rs.50,000/- on transportation and special diet etc. He is earning Rs.15,000/- per month by doing the work of account and farming in Anaj Mandi Ambala City. Due to this accident, claimant will not be able to do his job throughout his life and has become totally disabled and handicapped. Prior to the accident, he was hale and hearty and due to his disability, he is dependent upon others for his livelihood. The accident took place due to sole rash and negligence of driver of Offending Truck bearing Registration No. HR-37-A-7707 . SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 4 3The second claim petition reveals the similar facts of accident as already elaborated and so far as her injuries are concerned; it is pleaded that soon after the accident, injured Sahab Singh was taken to General Hospital, Ambala City, from where, he was referred to PGI Chandigarh Cantt, where he remained admitted from 31.10.2014 to 10.11.2014. He has become 85 % permanent disabled. His right leg was amputated. He spent Rs.5,00,000/- on his treatment, medicines, transportation and diet etc. He cannot walk properly without the help of crutches. He feels great difficulty in climbing stairs etc. His working capacity has been diminished due to this accident . On the basis of statement of Sohan Lal, FIR No. 134 dated 31.10.2014 under section 279, 337 of IPC was registered in Police Station, Ismailabad, District Kurukshetra against the respondent No.1. Hence, both claim petitions have been filed with prayer that respondents are liable jointly and severally to pay compensation. 4Notice of these petitions were given to the respondents. The respondent no.1 filed written statement controverting the assertions made in the petitions. He took some preliminary objections like maintainability; claim petitions are bad for non joinder and mis joinder of necessary parties;; that the claimants have no cause of action or locus standi to file the petitions; that the claimants are estopped by their own act and conduct from filing the present petitions. On merit, it has been submitted that no accident had been occurred by the answering respondent with his vehicle on the alleged date, time and place. As a matter of fact, answering respondent and his vehicle have been wrongly implicated in said false FIR SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 5 by the police colluded with the claimants, therefore, the claimants are not entitled to any compensation and no liability can be imposed on answering respondent. Rest of averments made in the petition are denied with a prayer for dismissal of both the claim petition with costs. 5The respondent No. 2 insurance company filed separate written statement controverting the assertions made in the petition and took some preliminary objections regarding maintainability, cause of action; that the claim petitions are hit by the principles of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence; that the petitions are bad for non joinder of necessary parties and mis joinder of parties; that there is no insurable interest between insurer and insured; that the person driving the Truck No. HR- 37-A-7707 was not having a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the accident in violation of the terms and conditions of the alleged insurance policy; that the respondent reserves its right to take all defences and pleas available under section 148, 149 (2), 167,169 and 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and in terms of the insurance policy. On merit, it has been submitted that no record regarding alleged, occupation and income of the claimants has been placed on record. It is denied that claimants suffered serious and grievous injuries due to this accident and they remained admitted in any hospital due to th injuries suffered in the alleged accident and spent such huge amount on their medical treatment, transportation etc. The truck bearing registration No. HR-37-A-7707 was never involved in any accident, however, the insurance particular of the vehicle in question has not been verified from the issuing authority so SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 6 same is not admitted, but the liability of the insurance company, if any, subject to the provisions of the M.V . Act and also terms and conditions thereof. The amount claimed as compensation is much more exaggerated and imaginary one. It is denied that the claimants suffered serious and grievous injuries due to this accident and they remained admitted in any hospital due to the injuries suffered in the alleged accident. The actual cause of alleged accident has been suppressed; as such the answering respondent is not liable in any manner. The claim claimants have been filed after due consultation just to get compensation from the answering respondent on purely made up basis which is not sustainable in the eyes of law, so the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. Rests of facts are denied and prayed for dismissal the petitions with special costs. 6Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following consolidated issues are framed vide order dated 14.05.2015:- 1.Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent of the respondent No.1 while driving Truck bearing Number HR-37-A-7707 resulting into causing injuries to Sohan Lal and Sahab Singh, as alleged?

PW5, Ramesh Lal {Criminal Ahlmad in the court of Ms. Rajni Kaushal, JMIC Pehowa, District, Kurukshetra} has produced the summoned record pertaining to case titled as State Vs Janak Raj, FIR No.134 dated 31.10.2014, u/s 279, 337, 338 IPC PS Ismailabad and the case was adjourned to 02.12.2015 for prosecution evidence. He has proved the copy of challan as Ex.P5, copy of charge sheet as Ex.P6; certified copy of site plan as Ex.P7, Mechanical report of Vehicle No. HR-01-P-3991 as Ex.P8 and mechanical report of HR-37-A-7707 as Ex.P9.

He has proved the copy of RC of vehicle No. HR-37-A-7707 as Ex.R1 DL of Janak Raj as Ex.R2 and copy of fitness certificate of vehicle No.HR-37-A-7707 as Ex.R3. Thereafter, learned counsel for claimants tendered documents i.e medical bills of Sahib Singh as Ex.P10 to Ex.P32 and medical bills of Sohan Lal as Ex.P33 to Ex.P107 and closed the evidence of the claimants vide his separately recorded statement. On the other hand, respondent No.2 tendered copy of insurance policy as Ex.R4 and t heir evidence was closed on 14.01.2016. No rebuttal evidence was led and learned counsel for the claimants closed the rebuttal evidence vide recorded statement dated 14.01.2016. 8I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1 : 9 Under this issue, petitioners- claimants are required to prove the fact that motor vehicular accident was occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Respondent no.1, while driving truck bearing Number HR-37-A-7707, resulting into causing injuries to Sohan Lal and Sahab Singh and as such the claimants are entitled to appropriate compensation from respondents. 10Learned counsel for the petitioners-claimants has argued that since accident in question was taken place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1 resulting causing injuries to Sohan Lal and Sahab Singh and offending vehicle is insured with SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 11 respondent no.2, therefore, respondent No.1 and respondent No.2 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. Learned counsel for claimants has further contended that vehicle in question was very much involved in the alleged accident and insured with respondent no.2. He urged for allowing the instant petition. 11 On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent no.1 has argued that no such accident, as alleged, was ever taken place with the involvement of offending vehicle, rather, False FIR was lodged against the respondent No.1, therefore, no negligence could be attributed to the respondent No.1 and in this view of the matter, no liability could be fastened upon the respondent no.1. He further urged that vehicle was insured with respondent no.2 and so owner of vehicle did not breach any condition of policy, therefore, insurance company has to indemnify the insured and as such both petitions are liable to be dismissed qua respondent no. 1 being devoid of merits. 12 Learned counsel for respondent No.2 has argued that FIR was registered against respondent No.1 only after due manipulation in collusion with each other just to shift undue burden upon the insurance company. He further argued that no accident was taken place with the offending vehicle belonging to respondent No.1, rather, Sohan Lal and Sahab Singh sustained injuries due to the fault of Sahab Singh as he was riding accidental motorcycle carrying three occupants against statutory rules or without caring traffic rules and so if accident is admitted, even then, sahib Singh can not be spared from contributory liability . He further SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 12 argued that respondent no.1 has breached the covenent of policy by non production of route permit and so insurance company is not liable to pay compensation and prayed for dismissal both petitions. 13I have given due regard to the rival contentions put forth by learned counsel for respective parties and have evaluated the entire oral evidence coupled with documentary evidence carefully. After thorough examination, it is observed that the petitioners-claimants have come to this Tribunal with categorical stand that the accident was taken place due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing Number HR-37-A-7707, resulting into causing injuries to Sohan Lal and Sahab Singh . In order to prove factum of accident, PW1 & PW2 {injured/eye witnesses} categorically stated through affidavits with regard to factum of accident, which was occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of truck bearing Number HR-37-A-7707 by respondent No.1. Further PW1 and PW2 being injured tendered affidavit EX.PW1/A and EX.PW2/A supporting the factum of accident. They were cross examined at length, but nothing adverse can be extracted disbelieving the factual position of motor vehicular accident. In this way, statement of PW1, PW2 being injured, can not be doubted from any angle regarding involvement of offending vehicle in the motor vehicular accident, particularly, when their statement are corroborated with documentary evidence like registration of FIR, copy of challan as Ex.P5, copy of charge sheet as Ex.P6; certified copy of site plan as Ex.P7, Mechanical report of Vehicle No. HR-01-P- 3991 as Ex.P8 and mechanical report of HR-37-A-7707 as Ex.P9. It SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 13 would be appropriate to point out here that despite availing opportunities, respondents failed to rebut the testimonies of claimants with regard to involvement of offending vehicle falsely in the said accident. Mere denial of rash and negligence at the behest of respondents after causing accident resulting causing injuries to two occupants of motor cycle, are not found sufficient at all disbelieving the factual position of accident. 14It is quite well settled that the lodging of the first information report is not an essential prerequisite for claiming compensation arising from a motor accident. Each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The Tribunal is expected to adjudge a case on the basis of the evidence produced without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled position of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. It must be remembered that in a motor accident claim, the claimants are not required to prove their case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. It is trite law that claimants-petitioners are required to prove its case, which sets up the particular case relating to the accident which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts upon the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way as alleged by the claimants. The provisions with regard to claim under the Act are enacted keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimants are always entitled for compensation irrespective whether the police has registered SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 14 the offence regarding the incident or not because no claim case can be left over on the mercy of the police. The evidence brought on record irrefutably leads to the inference in terms of unrebutted evidence at the instance of petitioners that there was taken place accident between motor cycle and ambulance van resulting causing injuries to claimants and death of driver of offending vehicle. In this way, it can be held that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of driver of offending vehicle. If rider Sahab Singh was riding motor cycle with two pillion riders against the statutory provision/ traffic rules, then he is liable to face punishment under traffic rules as per law. Accordingly, this issue no.1 is decided in favour of the claimants. ISSUE NO. 2: 15The onus to prove this issue is upon claimants. Learned counsel for claimants has submitted that offending vehicle was owned by respondent no.1 and was insured with respondent no.2, therefore, insurance company is liable to indemnify the insured and prayed for allowing petition. In support to his contention, he has placed reliance upon following authorities; In Arvind Kumar Mishra Vs. New India Assurance Co. Ltd and another, 2010 (4) RCR (Civil) 917 , it has been observed that Motor Accident- How to assess of earnings in respect of a victim who suffered 70% disablement:-Motor Accident due to rash and negligent driving of a truck driver- Claimant suffered 70% permanent disablement (right hand amputated, loss of vision of right eye) Victim was aged 25 years and a SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 15 brilliant student of Engineering with bright carrier- His earnings assessed at Rs.60,000/- per annum payable to Assistant Engineer in public employment- Since he suffered 70% permanent disability the future earnings may be discounted by 30% which came to Rs.42,000/- per annum- The operative multiplier would be 18. The loss of future earnings by multiplying the multiplicand of Rs.42,000/- by a multiplier of 18 comes to Rs.7,56,000/-. A sum of Rs.1.50 lacs awarded toward medical expenses- The total amount of compensation to which the appellant is entitled is Rs.9,06,000. It has been further observed that Award of compensation- Perfect compensation is hardly possible- However, Court must take care to give the victim full and fair compensation for that he had suffered- In some cases for personal injury, the cases for personal injury, the claim could be in respect of life time's earnings lost because, though, he will live, he cannot earn his living- In others, the claim may be made for partial loss of earnings- Each case has to be considered in the light of its own facts and at the end, one must ask whether the sum awarded is a fair and reasonable sum. In Raj Kumar Vs. Ajay Kumar and another, 2011 (1) ACC 1, it has been observed that Quantum injury- Principles of assessment- Determination of loss of future earnings of the injured with reference to extent of his permanent disablement explained- Principles enumerated and illustrations given. Principles are: (i)All injuries for permanent disabilities arising from injuries, SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 16 do not result in loss of earning capacity. (ii)The percentage of permanent disability with reference to the whole body of a person, cannot be assumed to be the percentage of loss of earning capacity. To put it differently, the percentage of loss of earning capacity is not the same as the percentage of permanent disability (except in a few cases, where the Tribunal on the basis of evidence, concludes that percentage of loss of earning capacity is the same as percentage of permanent disability). (iii)The doctor who treated an injured-claimant or who examined him subsequently to assess the extent of his permanent disability can give evidence only in regard to the extent of permanent disability. The loss of earning capacity is something that will have to be assessed by the Tribunal with reference to the evidence in entirety. (iv)The same permanent disability may result in different percentages of loss of earning capacity in different persons, depending upon the nature of profession, occupation or job, age, education and other factors. It has also been observed that Quantum- Injury- Principles of assessment- Personal expenses- Whether one-third or any other percentage may be deducted as personal or living expenses from income of the injured while computing his future loss of earnings- Held: No. In K. Suresh Vs. New India Assurance Co.Ltd. And another, 2012 ACJ 2694 , it has been observed that Quantum- Injury- Principles of assessment- Loss of earning power and permanent disability- Injured sustained injuries resulting in 40 per cent permanent disablement- SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 17 Tribunal awarded Rs.5,00,000 for loss of earning capacity and further Rs.3,00,000 towards permanent disablement-Appellate court allowed Rs.4,68,000 for loss of earning capacity and disallowed compensation for permanent disablement- Whether total deletion of compensation for permanent disablement is justified- Held: no, compensation can be granted under both heads. In Karnail Singh and others Vs. Balwinder Singh and another, 2013 (1) PLR 774 , it has been observed that three persons on a motorcycle having been hit by Maruti car coming from behind- The three persons traveling on a motorcycle may have been guilty of traffic offence but there is no reason for the Court to make any inference regarding negligence as contributory by the only fact that three persons were going on motorcycle. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents No.2 has vehemently argued that although offending vehicle was insured with policy EX.R4 but no route permit has been brought on record. He further argued that injured Sahib Singh was riding motor cycle with two pillion riders as admitted and so he is contributory liable to share as he was also driving the motorcycle in violation of the provisions of Motor Vehicles Act and prayed for dismissal the same. Learned counsel for respondents no.2 has placed reliance upon following case law:- In support to his contentions, learned counsel for respondent No.2 has placed reliance upon case law cited as Angrejo Devi and others Vs. Jai Parkash and Others, 2012 (4) PLR 604, wherein it has been observed that Negligence- Motor cycle is designed to ride two persons, if used by more than two SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 18 persons, then the driver will have to share part of his seat, he will not be able to control the vehicle effectively- Moreover, the weight on account of third passenger will affect its stability- was also driving the motorcycle in violation of the provisions of the M.V Act- Learned Tribunal has rightly come to the conclusion that it was a case of contributory negligence of the deceased in the ratio of 50% each. In Madan Lal Papneja Vs. State of Haryana and others, 2011 (1) PLR 61 , it has been observed that Disability may either be permanent or temporary- For permanent disability- which is capable of ascertainment in terms of percentage of functional disability of the particular organ of the body that is affected, the amount could be Rs.1000/- for every % of permanent disability and Rs.250/- for every % of temporary disability. In Kamala Mangalal Vayani and others Vs. M/s United India Insurance Company Ltd and others, 2010 (2) PLR 687 , it has been observed that Owner and driver proceeded ex parte- Failure of insurance company to prove that the vehicle had no permit- Insurance company held liable- Insured can proceed against the owner and recovering the amount paid by it so the claimants, in the event of the insurer being able to establish, in any suit it may choose to file against the owner, that there was violation or breach of the conditions of the insurance policy or that the vehicle was not covered by a permit on the date of the accident. 16Having due regard to the rival contentions put forth by counsel for the parties, it is observed that rider of motorcycle namely SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 19 Sohan Lal was riding accidental vehicle by violating the statutory provision of law as admitted and therefore this substantial fact can be taken into consideration for breach of traffic rules as per law as held in Karnail Singh and others Vs. Balwinder Singh and another, 2013 (1) PLR 774,. According to evidence, it can be gathered that injured Sohan Lal remained admitted as indoor patient w.e.f.31.10.2104 to 8.12.2014 and he spent total amount of Rs.1,57,211 { In round figure 1,57,300/-} as per medical bills EX.P33-EX.P106. He did not sustain any permanent disability and as such following assessment is made; Pecuniary damages (Special damages) (i).Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization in PGI, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and miscellaneous expenditure.RS.1,57,300/- medical expenses and Rs. 9000/- as indoor patient @ 1000/- per day including all expenses. (ii).Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising: (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment; (b) Loss of future earning on account of injuries etc. 5000/- nil (iii). Future medical expenses. 5000/- None-pecuniary damages (General damages) (iv). Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries. RS. 10 ,000/- (v). Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage). nil (vi).Loss of expectation of life ( shortening of normal longevity). Nil. Total Compensation Rs.,1,86,300/- SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 20 17In this way, petitioner-claimant Sohan Lal is held entitled to comenstaion amounting Rs.1,86,300/- along with interest @ 7.5% per annumfrom the date of filing of petition till realization of awarded amount, which is quite fair, reasonable and just compensation. Rests of relief sought by petitioner-claimant stands declined. 18 So far as second claimant Sahib Singh is concerned; it is evident that said Sahib Singh was hospitalized in PGI for a period from 31.10.2014 to 10.11.2014 as Indoor patient. PW3 Dr. Vikas Paul, proved the disability certificate as Ex.P3 showing his 83% permanent on account of amputation of right thigh and also stated that the disability assessed by the Board is of particular limb only. He relied bills Ex.P10 to Ex.P32 showing total expenses of Rs.52,313/-{ in round figure 52400/-} was being spent on his treatment. According to his version coupled with medical evidence, he suffered 83% physical permanent disability of particular limb and so In view of extent of physical disability and its nature when examined in the light of Judgment in Ram Kiran Goyal vs Sub Divisional engineer, mechanical and other 2008 {2} RCR {Civil}103, the claimant Sahib Singh is held entitled to Rs. 1,66,000/- @ 2,000/- per percent. 19In view of the law settled in Raj Kumar Vs Ajay Kumar, (2011)1 SCC 343 , the petitioner is held entitled to the following compensation: Pecuniary damages (Special damages) SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 21 46 percent permanent Physical injuries to particular limb; Rs. 1,66,000/- (i).Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization in PGI, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and miscellaneous expenditure.Rs.52300/- medical expenses and Rs. 11000/- as indoor patient @ 1000/- per day including all expenses.

Future medical expenses. 25000/- None-pecuniary damages (General damages) (iv). Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries. RS. 15 ,000/- (v). Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage). nil (vi).Loss of expectation of life ( shortening of normal longevity). Nil. Total Compensation Rs.,3,24,300/- 20 In this way, petitioner-claimant Sahib Singh is held entitled to comenstaion amounting Rs.3,24,300/- along with interest @ 7.5% per annumfrom the date of filing of petition till realization of awarded amount, which is quite fair, reasonable and just compensation. Rests of relief sought by petitioner-claimant stands declined. ISSUE NO.3 to 5, 7&8 : 21 The onus to prove these issues is upon Respondents but they neither pressed this issue nor led any evidence. However, it has already discussed in detail under Issue No.1 & 2 that accident was occurred due to SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 22 rash ad negligent driving of respondent no.1. In this way, it has become obvious on file that this tribunal has left with no other option except to decide these issues against Respondents. Accordingly, these issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.6: 22 Coming to question of liability where under onus to prove this issue is upon the respondent No.2, who is under the obligation to prove the fact that respondent No.1 was not holding valid driving licence to run offending vehicle at the day of alleged accident and as such he has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. 23However, there is nothing on record to show that respondent No.1, was not holding any valid license, rather same is proved as EX.R2 . Further Insurance Policy Ex.R4 reveals that offending vehicle as per RC EX.R1 in the name of respondent no.1 was insured with the respondent No.2 at the time of accident. The respondent no.1 has also furnished fitness certificate of offending vehicle as EX.R3 and so non production of route permit would not defeat right of respondent no.1 to indemnify the claim by respondent no.2. Resultantly, respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation as such respondent no.2 shall indemnify the claim. Accordingly, this Issue is decided against the respondent No.2. ISSUE NO.9 (RELIEF): BOTH Petitions succeed ; 24 In view of the foregoing discussion, both the claim petition are partly allowed with cost. Claimant-petitioner Sohan Lal is SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 23 entitled to compensation of Rs. 1,86,300/- along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this claim petition till the date of actual payment.

Shri Ashutosh Gupta, counsel for respondent No.1. Shri Mohinder Bindal, counsel for respondent No.2. AWARD: The present claim petition has been filed under Section 166 Ram Kumar Vs. Tapose Bose etc. 2 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (amended up to date) , by the petitioner against the respondents claiming compensation to the tune of Rs. Ten lakhs alongwith interest for the injuries sustained by him in the Motor Vehicular Accident, which took place on 05.01.2015 due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 while driving offending vehicle i.e. Car bearing registration No. No.UP-32-PU-7030. 2.PLEADINGS (I)PETITIONER: On 05.01.2015, the petitioner/injured namely Ram Kumar along with his cousin namely Aman Kumar was going on motorcycle bearing registration No.HR-01Z-6341 make Bajaj Platina towards Jarot Road. At about 1.30 P.M., when they reached near Sultanpur Chowk and took turn towards Jarot Road, meanwhile, a Car bearing registration No. No.UP-32-PU-7030 being driven by respondent No.1 in a rash and negligent manner, at a very high speed and without blowing any horn came from Chandigarh side and hit the motorcycle of injured. Due to the impact of the accident, both of them fell down on the road and sustained multiple and grievous injuries. The petitioner sustained injuries above the eyes, hands and other parts of the body including fracture of left Medial and lateral malleolous whereas his cousin namely Aman Kumar sustained injuries o his legs, hips and other parts of the body including fracture of left acetabulum. The petitioner/injured was taken to Healing Touch Hospital, Ambala City where he remained admitted for one day. Thereafter, the petitioner was got admitted in K.D.Hospital, Ram Kumar Vs. Tapose Bose etc. 3 Ambala Cantt w.e.f. 06.01.2015 to 13.01.2015 where he was operated on 07.01.2015. Thereafter, petitioner took follow up treatment as per advise of doctor for about 2-3 months. He has spent more than Rs.2,50,000/- on the treatment, medicines, special diet and transportation etc. and more amount is likely to be spent as he is still under treatment. It is further pleaded that the accident had taken place due to sole negligence of respondent No.1 and the said vehicle is insured with respondent No.2. Thereafter, on the statement of the petitioner which was recorded by the police on the same day, FIR No. 4 dated 05.01.2015 Under Sections 279/337 IPC P.S. Baldev Nagar was registered against the driver of offending vehicle i.e. respondent No.1. At the time of accident, the injured was studying and was a brilliant student. He used to give tuitions to the students and was earning about Rs.20,000/- per month but due to the injuries sustained in this accident, the study of the injured has been disturbed and the injured has become permanent handicapped and is not in a position to do his normal pursuit. Thus, the total life of the injured has been ruined. With these averments, a sum of Rs. 10 lakhs alongwith interest has been claimed as compensation. (II) RESPONDENTS NO.1 ( DRIVER AND OWNER) Upon notice, respondent No.1 appeared and filed his written statement taking the preliminary objection of maintainability. On merits, it is pleaded that no accident took place with the car of respondent No.1 and the same has been falsely implicate in the present case just to get the compensation from him. In fact, he was coming back from Ram Kumar Vs. Tapose Bose etc. 4 Chandigarh to Ambala Cantt and at about 1.30 P.M. when he reached near Sultanpur Chowk, P.S. Baldev Nagar, District Ambala, the claimant along with his cousin Aman Kumar has already met with an accident and was lying on the road. He on humanitarian ground took both of them to nearest hospital i.e. Healing Touch Hospital, Ambala City and got them admitted in the said hospital. He also paid initial charges amounting to Rs.13,925/- through his credit card and thereafter he left the hospital along with his car. He received a call after about 10 days, when his vehicle was involved in the alleged accident. He was asked to appear before P.S. Baldev Nagar. He made representation to the Investigating Officer about the true facts but he in connivance with the claimant falsely implicated the answering respondent and vehicle in question. A false and frivolous FIR has been lodged against answering respondent No.1. While denying other averments, prayer for dismissal of the claim petition was made. (III) RESPONDENT NO.2 ( INSURANCE COMPANY) Respondent No.2 filed written statement and preliminary objections qua claim petition being misconceived, vexatious, untenable and devoid of any merit; collusion; car No.UP-32-PU-7030 being not insured with respondent No.2 on the date of alleged accident; respondent driving the vehicle without effective driving licence, fitness certificate, not adhering to the terms and conditions of policy etc. were taken. It also took all defence pleas as available under Sections 147, 149(2), 149(2) (b), 157 and 170 of the Motor Vehicle Act. On merits, it Ram Kumar Vs. Tapose Bose etc. 5 is pleaded that no accident, as alleged, has taken place with the alleged Car bearing registration No. No.UP-32-PU-7030 and the present claim petition has been filed in collusion with respondent No.1 just to extract compensation from answering respondent by falsely impleading the said vehicle in the present case on the basis of a concocted and manipulated version. Respondent No.2 has been wrongly impleaded in the present claim petition because the alleged Car bearing registration No. No.UP- 32-PU-7030 was not insured with answering respondent on the alleged date of accident i.e. on 05.01.2015. If it is presumed, though not admitted that any accident has taken place on the aforesaid date, even then, the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation as the petitioner has suffered the alleged injuries only due to sole rash and negligent driving of motorcycle at fast and uncontrollable speed while taking abrupt turn to cross the road, without caring rules and traffic on the road and consequently skidding thereof. It was denied that the petitioner was involved in any tuition work or that he was earning alleged Rs.20,000/- per month. It was also denied that the petitioner suffered alleged injuries or remained under alleged treatment. It was also denied that he is still under any treatment or that he became disabled or suffered physically or financially due to alleged. All the factual averments made in claim petition were denied and it has been prayed that the claim petition may be dismissed. (IV)REPLICATION TO THE WRITTEN STATEMENT Not filed. Ram Kumar Vs. Tapose Bose etc. 6 It is pertinent to mention here that vide order dated 13.01.2016, claim petition titled as Aman Kumar Vs. Tapose and Ram Kumar Vs. Tapose were consolidated being arising out of the same accident and consolidated issues were framed but later on, on 19.09.2016, claim petition No.300 of 2015 titled as Aman Kumar Vs Tapose Bose was withdrawn by learned counsel for the claimant Aman Kumar vide his separate statement dated 19.09.2016 and fresh issues were re-framed. 3.ISSUES SETTLED ON 19.09.2016: (1.)Whether accident in question occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 while driving Car bearing No. UP-32-PU-7030, resulting in injuries to claimant Ram Kumar, as alleged? OPP (2.)If issue No.1 is proved, whether claimant is entitled to compensation, if so, how much and from whom? OPP (3.)Whether respondent No.1 was driving offending vehicle in violation of terms and conditions of Insurance Policy, if so, its effect? OPR(2) (4.)Relief. 4.EVIDENCE OF PARTIES: (I) PETITIONER EVIDENCE Oral Evidence CW1 Ram Kumar (petitioner) CW2Subhash Mukhija, Record Keeper Ram Kumar Vs. Tapose Bose etc. 7 CW3Raj Kumar Sharma Documentary Evidence: Ex.C1 to Ex.C7 :Medical Bills Ex.C8 :Discharge summary Ex.C9 to Ex.C26 :Copies of medical bills/receipts (II)RESPONDENTS EVIDENCE Oral Evidence Nil. Documentary Evidence: Ex.RA :Certified copy of site plan Ex.R1 :Photocopy of Insurance Policy Ex.R2 :Photocopy of RC of vehicle No.UP-32-EU-7030 Ex.R3 : Copy of Driving Licence of Taposh Bose (III)REBUTTAL EVIDENCE Oral Evidence Nil. Documentary Evidence Nil. ISSUE-WISE FINDINGS : 5.ISSUE NO.1 : The onus to prove this issue was upon the petitioner. The petitioner examined himself as CW1 and stated that the accident Ram Kumar Vs. Tapose Bose etc. 8 occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. He has also given vivid account as to how the accident has occurred. It has also been stated by him in his examination-in-chief that FIR No.4 dated 05.01.2015 under Sections 279/337/338 IPC was registered against respondent No.1 in P.S. Baldev Nagar, Ambala. The FIR was lodged on the same day of the accident. He was cross-examined at length by learned counsel for respondents but his statement could not be shattered. The learned counsel for the respondents has tried to project that there was contributory negligence on the part of petitioners in causing the accident and while pleading so, reliance has been placed upon Crime Detail Form/ rough site plan Ex.RA. However, the said document itself is unable to persuade this Tribunal to arrive at the findings for contributory negligence by the petitioner. Respondent no.1 did not make any complaint to any authority regarding his false implication by the police. It means that he was satisfied. Further, he did not step into witness box to deny the allegations of rash and negligent driving by him. Thus, adverse inference can be drawn against him for not stepping into the witness box in view of the judgment titled as New India Insurance Co. Ltd. Versus Swaran Kanta 1997(3) RCR (Civil) 591 (P&H) (DB); United India Insurance Company Versus Sham Lal,2010(2) Law Herald 1709 . Accordingly, the petitioner is successful in proving issue No.1 against respondent No.1 that he received injuries in the accident Ram Kumar Vs. Tapose Bose etc. 9 occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. 6. ISSUE NO.2 : The accident occurred on 05.01.2015. Immediately after the accident, the petitioner was taken to Healing Touch Hospital, Ambala City where he remained admitted from 05.01.2015 to 06.01.2015. Later on, he was shifted to K.D. Hospital MRI & C.T. Scan, Mahesh Nagar, Ambala Cantt where he remained admitted from 06.01.205 to 13.01.2015. As per discharge Summary Ex.C8, petitioner suffered fracture (L) medial and lateral malleolous. He was operated upon on 07.01.2015 and open reduction internal fixation with K-wires was done. He was discharged on 13.01.2015. The treatment record of the petitioner has been proved on record as Ex.CW2/B. The perusal of medical receipts placed on record reflect that the petitioner remained under treatment up to 25.04.2015. Keeping in view the hospitalization of 9 days and the injuries suffered by the petitioner and the treatment thereof, he is held entitled to a sum of Rs.50,000/- on account of pain and suffering, hospitalization, fracture, surgery etc. In view of the injuries suffered by the claimant, he must have required attendant for at least two month and would have to be transported for his follow up treatment. Accordingly, he is held entitled for Rs. 10000/- on account of attendant Charges and Rs. 3000/- on account of transportation charges. Ram Kumar Vs. Tapose Bose etc. 10 The petitioner has proved on record original receipts/bills Ex.C1 to Ex.C7. Ex.C6 is the bill of Healing Touch Hospital,Ambala where the petitioner was taken immediately after the accident. Further the consolidated bill of his treatment in K.D. Hospital MRI & C.T. Scan, Mahesh Nagar, Ambala Cantt is Ex.CW2/A which has been proved by CW2 Sh. Subhash Mukhija, Accountant/Record Keeper of K.D.Hospital MRI & C.T. Scan, Mahesh Nagar, Ambala Cantt. The petitioner has also proved on record his medical bills/receipts from Ex. C-9 to Ex. C-26 through CW3 Raj Kumar Sharma, who is proprietor of RKS Medicose, Mahesh Nagar, Ambala Cantt. He stated that the said medicines were provided to the petitioner under prescription of Dr. K.D.Sharma and Shushrut Sharma. The total of the said bills/receipts comes to Rs.51,465.61/-. Accordingly, the petitioner is granted sum of Rs.51,500/- (rounded off) on account of medical expenses. The petitioner claims himself to be a student and earning Rs.20,000/- per annum from tuitions. However, no record of any tuition has been proved on record. Once, the petitioner has claimed himself to be a student, there was heavy onus upon him to prove that he was earning from tuitions etc. During his cross-examination, he has specifically stated that he did not have any proof of giving tuitions and income from the tuitions. Thus, it cannot be said that the petitioner suffered any loss of income. Though, he has stated that he had to drop one year because of the said accident but there is no record qua the same proved on record. Ram Kumar Vs. Tapose Bose etc. 11 There is nothing on record that the petitioner suffered any permanent disability or he is likely to suffer any future loss of income. Thus, the petitioner is held entitled to the compensation as under : Sr. No.Heads of Claim Amount र 1Pain and suffering, hospitalization etc. Rs. 50,000/- 2Attendant Charges Rs. 10,000/- 3Transportation Rs. 3,000/- 4Medical expenses Rs. 51,500/- Total Rs. 1,14,500/- LIABILITY OF INSURANCE COMPANY: The next question for determination is as to who is liable to pay the said amount. As determined in issue no.1, the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 while driving the offending vehicle. The driving licence is Ex.R3. Registration certificate of the offending vehicle is Ex.R2 and insurance policy is Ex.R1. Admittedly, insurance policy is valid. No violation of terms and conditions of the policy has been pointed out. No defect in the driving licence of respondent No.1 could be pointed out. Respondent No.2 is to indemnify the insured (Respondent No.1). In view of the above, the respondents are held liable to pay Ram Kumar Vs. Tapose Bose etc. 12 the compensation jointly and severally. Thus, issue no.2 is decided in favour of petitioner 7. ISSUES NO.3 Onus to prove the said issue was upon respondent No.2. However, neither any evidence was led on the said issue nor it was pressed during the arguments. Accordingly, the said issue is decided against the respondent No.2. 8.

SAPNA ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 2 -.- Present:- Shri I.S.Gill, counsel for the petitioners. Shri S.P.Singh, counsel for the respondent No.1. Shri Mohinder Bindal, counsel for the respondent No.2. AWARD:- Petitioners have brought t his claim petition under Section 163-A of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, for grant of compensation of Rs.20,00,000/-, on account of death of Sh. Ravinder Kumar son of Sh. Malkhan Singh @ Malkhan Chand resident of Village Sherpur, PO Sulakhnai, P.S. Mullana, Tehsil Barara, District Ambala, who was died in a road side accident occurred on 06.07.2015 at about 9.30 PM, within the area of Police Station Naraingarh, District Ambala . 2The necessary facts leading to accident in question are that on 06.07.2015, Sh. Ravinder Kumar {deceased} had gone to Sadhaura Town on motorcycle bearing registration No. HR-54-C-0569 for personal work. One Rakesh Kumar son of Jeet Ram, resident of Village Sherpur, P.S. Mullana, District Ambala had also gone to Sadhaura Town to purchase some articles on his own motorcycle. They both started return journey towards their village Sherpur on separate motorcycles and at about 9.30 PM, when they reached near Dera Gurdev Singh, Rakba Village Sarawan, P.S Sadhaura, District Yamuna Nagar, at that time, Ravinder Kumar was going ahead on his motorcycle bearing No. HR-54-C-0569 and Rakesh Kumar was following him on his separate motorcycle. In the mean time, an unknown truck driven by an unknown driver at high speed, rashly and negligently, without blowing horn, came from Village Sarawan side and when he was trying to overtake an another truck, he hit the SAPNA ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 3 motorcycle bearing registration No. HR-54-C-0569 of the deceased Ravinder Kumar, as a result of that, Ravinder Kumar fell down and received serious injuries. The unknown driver of the said truck ran away alongwith his truck from the place of accident. Said Rakesh Kumar with the help of passersby arranged a private vehicle and took Ravinder Kumar to CHC Sadhaura for treatment and after giving first aid the doctor on duty referred Ravinder Kumar to GH Yamuna Nagar, where he was taken in Ambulance and after examination, the doctor referred Ravinder Kumar to PGI Chandigarh but during the way to PGI Chandigarh, Ravinder Kumar succumbed to his injuries at some distance away from GH Yamuna Nagar and doctor after checking declared him dead. He died in the motor vehicle accident due to involvement of motorcycle bearing registration No. HR-54-C-0569. So far as status of deceased Ravinder Kumar is concerned; his date of birth was 20.12.1979 (35 years 06 months) at the day of accident and was earning Rs.3300/- per month by doing labour work. Since the accident was occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 and therefore, case bearing FIR No. 94 dated 07.07.2015 under sections 279, 304-A IPC was registered against unknown driver of unknown truck number in Police Station Sadhaura, District Yamuna Nagar. All claimants including wife, minors daughter, son and parents were fully dependent upon the income of the deceased. His death in the accident has left the family completely in destitute. The most effected members of the family are claimants No.2 and 3 and their upbringing and SAPNA ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 4 education will be adversely effected. The claimant No.1 lost the company of her husband, so, she is entitled for compensation for loss of consortium also. The claimants are entitled for expenses incurred on transportation of dead body, funeral, last rites of the deceased, loss of proper looking after the claimants, loss of consortium, loss of dependency, loss of future earning and non pecuniary compensation on account of loss of happiness, emotional pain, suffering, loss of life etc. Since the accidental motorcycle was involved in the accident, therefore, respondent No.1 being owner and respondent No.2 being insurer are equally, jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the claimants. Hence, this petition. 3Upon notice, respondent No.1 being registered owner of accidental motor cycle filed written statement admitting the entire facts mentioned in the petition. However, it is submitted that in case this Hon;ble Tribunal reaches to the conclusion that the claimants are entitled for any compensation, then respondent No.2 may be held liable to pay compensation, with whom, the Motorcycle bearing registration No. HR- 54-C-0569 was insured at the day of accident and prayed for dismissal the petition. 4The respondent No.2 (insurance company) took preliminary objections to the effect that claim petition qua the answering respondent is ex-facie, misconceived, vexatious, untenable and devoid of merit; that no case is made out against the answering respondent, hence, the present claim petition be dismissed with costs; that no accident as alleged taken place involving the alleged motorcycle bearing Registration No. HR-54C- SAPNA ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 5 0569, however, the same has been impleaded in the present case in collusion with its registered owner who is real brother of the deceased just to have compensation from the answering insurance company; that if it is presumed though not admitted that any accident has taken place on the aforesaid date involving the motorcycle bearing Registration No. HR-54C-0569, even then, the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation as per the verdict given by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case titled Ningamma & Anr Vs. United India Insurance Co. Ltd and also being relied upon by our High Court in so many judgments on the subject since a driver steps in to the shoes of owner while driving a vehicle and hence becomes symbolic owner thus not entitled to any compensation from the insurer of that vehicle, thus, the present claim petition is liable to be dismissed on this score; that the present claim petition is not maintainable since the claimants have not approached this Hon'ble Tribunal with clean hands and have concealed true fact from this Court. The claimants are also guilty of suppressing the actual income and profession of the deceased. The claimants have given false version about the income of the deceased just to bring their case under the provisions of Section 163-A of the Motor Vehicles Act; that if the cause of accident is proved, even then, the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation since the deceased suffered the alleged injuries and death due to his own negligence while driving the alleged motorcycle and the legal heirs of a tortfeasor cannot claim compensation under the Motor Vehicle Act. The deceased, who was SAPNA ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 6 allegedly driving the motorcycle bearing registration No. HR-54C- 0569 was not having a valid and effective driving licence, at the time of alleged accident and was driving in violation of the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, thus the answering insurance company is not liable to indemnify the alleged insured qua the alleged accident; that answering respondent reserves its right to take all defences and pleas available to respondent No.1, the owner of the Motorcycle bearing Registration No. HR-54-C-0569 under section 147, 149 (2), 157 and 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and in terms of the policy of insurance. On merit, insurance company took similar stand as taken in preliminary objected which is not required to be repeated. Lastly it is submitted that this petition has been filed on false, frivolous grounds and without any cause of action against the answering respondent and has been filed only to extract compensation from the answering respondent, hence, prayed for dismissal the claim petition with special costs. 5Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following issues are framed :- 1Whether vehicle bearing registration No. HR-54-C- 0569 was involved in Motor Vehicular Accident which was taken place on 6.7.2015 at about 9.30PM as a result of that Ravinder Kumar succumbed to his injuries and as such legal heirs of Ravinder Kumar are entitled to compensation under section 163-A of M.V . Act against insured of accidental motorcycle, as alleged? OPP. 2If Issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom, the claimants are entitled to? OPP. 3Whether petition is not maintainable in the present SAPNA ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 7 form? OPR. 4Whether the claimants have not come to the court with clean hands and have suppressed true and material facts from the court, if so, its effect ?OPR 5Whether respondent no.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect? OPR. 6Whether respondent no.2 is entitled to take all the defences available to it under the M.V . Act ?

He has brought the damage claim file of vehicle No.HR-54-C/0569 make Bajaj Platina registered owner of this vehicle is respondent No.1 Krishan Lal. This motorcycle was involved in accident on 6.7.2015 in the jurisdiction of P.S. Sadhaura. In this case, Ravinder Kumar brother of Krishan Lal died in the accident. In this accident, motorcycle bearing registration No. HR-54-C-0569 was also damaged. The said motorcycle was repaired from Dang Automobiles Sadhaura. Our company had paid Rs.5400/- with regard to the said motorcycle of damage. He has produced photo copy of Motor claim approval sheet as Ex.P16 and photo copy of claim intimation sheet as Ex.P17 in his evidence and thereafter learned counsel for claimants closed the evidence on 29.07.2016. SAPNA ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 9 On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent no.1 tendered documents i.e copy of RC Ex.R1, copy of insurance policy Ex.R2 and closed his evidence. Further, respondent No.2 did not lead any evidence and closed the same by recording separate statement. No rebuttal evidence was led and was closed by counsel. 7I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on issues are as under: ISSUE NO.1, 2 &5: 8 All these issues are inter-connected and inter-linked and as such same can be conveniently discussed together. Under these issues, claimants-petitioners are required to establish regarding involvement of motor cycle bearing registration No. HR-54-C-0569 in the motor vehicular accident, resulting into death of Ravinder Kumar and if it is so whether claimants being legal heirs of deceased are entitled to appropriate compensation under section 163-A of Motor Vehicles Act against insurance company of accidental vehicle. 9 Learned counsel for the claimants has contended that vehicle in question was damaged in the motor vehicular accident and respondent No.2 had given a sum of Rs.5400/- on account of damages of motor cycle bearing registration No. HR-54-C-0569 to its registered owner i.e respondent no.1 as per documents Ex.P16, Ex.P17 and Ex.P18 and so claimants have duly proved the factum of involvement of vehicle in question in the motor vehicular accident. He further contended that claimants are not required to establish rash and negligent act of driver, SAPNA ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 10 rather, he has to establish only involvement of accidental vehicle under section 163 A of act which is proved and so claimants being legal heirs are entitled to appropriate compensation, according to multiplier as applied for and prayed for deciding both these issues in favour of claimants. He further argued that insurance of accidental vehicle belonging to respondent no.1 was covered under comprehensive/ package policy and so owner/driver of accidental vehicle is entitled to personal accident claim against insurance company as deceased being brother has stepped in to shoe of registered owner who is his real brother. In support of his contentions, he placed reliance upon following authorities:- In New India Assurance Co. Ltd Vs. Umesh Kumari and others, 2011 ACJ 890(P&H) , it was observed that Motor Insurance- Comprehensive policy- Death of son of owner of vehicle- Liability of insurance company- Premium for covering personal accident to owner-cum-driver had been paid- Insurance company disputes its liability on the ground that owner was not himself driving the vehicle, deceased who was son of owner was not covered under the premium paid for covering risk of owner-cum-driver-Deceased has to be termed as owner as he stepped into the shoes of owner by borrowing the vehicle with permission of the owner-Whether insurance company is liable- Held: Yes, deceased has to be treated as owner and the phrase owner-cum-driver would cover owner or driver of vehicle. In New India Assurance Co. Ltd Vs. Karamjit and others 2013 (2) PLR 495 {P&H} , it was observed that Once the driver who borrowed the vehicle from the owner has become the SAPNA ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 11 owner of the vehicle for all practical purposes, then the insurance company is liable to pay the compensation payable to the owner under the personal accident coverage- In all cases where premium for personal accident of the owner-cum-driver has been paid, the L.R.s of the driver of the injured-driver who becomes the owner of the vehicle for all practical purposes under Section 163-A of the Act is entitled to claim the compensation from the insurance company under the personal accident coverage. In Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd and others Vs. Anil Kumar and Others , 2014 (1) PLR 129{P&H} , it was observed that Motor Vehicles Act- Liability-Deceased who was driving the motorcycle had borrowed the same from its owner and, therefore, stepped into the shoes of the owner- The policy issued for the motorcycle had been comprehensive policy where additional premium had been paid for covering owner and driver- Additional premium had been paid to cover the owner and driver, the said policy would cover the claim of the claimants in that situation and the insurance company was held liable to pay compensation In Kusum Lata & Others Vs. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd and another, 2014 (4) PLR 614{P&H} , it was observed that 163-A- Claim application was filed by legal representatives of the deceased who had borrowed it from the owner- Package policy which provides insurance cover to own damage to vehicle or damage beyond the statutory minimum would also come through special package, which is termed as 'Package policy'- Insured had paid premium for personal accident as well as for the driver and that would cover the risk of the driver to the extent SAPNA ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 12 mentioned in the policy as it was a case of limited liability. In Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company Limited Vs. Jasmer Singh and another , 2015 (1) PLR 782 {{P&H} , it was observed that Package policy- Deposit of premium for personal accident claim in the package/ comprehensive policy- Cannot be limited only to the owner as the words used in the policy to cover personal accident is described as 'owner driver'. In Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Limited Vs. Poonam and Others , 2015 (2) PLR 235 {P&H} , it was observed that Liability- Borrowed motor cycle and met with an accident- Stepped into shoes of the registered owner of the vehicle- Not disentitled to seek compensation under section 163-A of the Act. It was further observed that Two wheeler package policy- Had borrowed motorcycle and met with an accident- Accident cover for owner driver- Stepped into the shoes of the owner of the vehicle, met with an accident out of use of the motor vehicle, therefore, the legal representatives shall be entitled to an amount of Rs.1,00,000.00 for death and prayed for allowing this claim petition. 10 On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent no.2 has vehemently argued that instant claim petition is neither maintainable nor claimants are entitled to any claim against the insurance company because neither deceased was registered owner of accidental vehicle nor covered under insurance policy EX.P2 relating to personal accident claim and so deceased being brother cannot step into shoe of registered owner. He further argued that no doubt claimants are not required to establish rash and negligent driving while seeking relief under section 163-A of SAPNA ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 13 M.V .Act but they are required to establish involvement of offending vehicle simultaneously but here claimants did not disclose number of offending vehicle nad name of truck driver and so mere lodging FIR against unknown vehicle/driver, it would not cover this claim under insurance policy and so respondent No.2 is not liable to pay any claim to legal heirs of deceased Ravinder Kumar. He further argued that word reelected in insurance policy qua owner/driver is restricted to registered owner of vehicle under personal claim and not beyond that in any manner as held in Niggamma case and prayed for dismissal the petition against answering respondent. In support to his contentions, he placed reliance upon following authorities:- In Ningamma & Anr Vs. United India Insurance Co.Ltd, 2009 (2) ACC 804 (SC) , it was observed that deceased was driving motor vehicle, after borrowing from original owner- Deceased met with accident without involving any other vehicle- Legal representatives of deceased not entitled to compensation under Section 163A-Liability under Section 163A is on owner of vehicle- Person cannot be both claimant as also recipient with respect to claim- Payment of compensation provided under Section 163A mandating that owner or authorised insurer would be liable to pay compensation , in case of death or permanent disablement due to accident arising out of other motor vehicle- In present case, deceased borrowed motorbike from real owner, cannot be held to be employee of owner of motorbike although he was authorised to drive said vehicle by owner- Deceased would step into shoes of owner of SAPNA ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 14 motorbike- Legal representatives of deceased stepped into shoes of owner of motor vehicle not entitled to compensation- Findings of High Court that Section 163A is not applicable to present case upheld. In M/s Reliance General Insurance Company Vs. Ranjit and another, 2015 (2) PLR 663{P&H} , it was observed that Motorcycle was being driven by Ranjit Singh who is not registered owner but the brother of the registered owner- The accident had not taken place with the involvement of any other vehicle but because a cow had came in front of motorcycle all of a sudden and in order to save the cow, he lost his balance and fell on the road and sustained injuries- Payment on account of personal accident claim can be given to the person duly covered under the insurance policy and not to any body else including brother of the person covered under such a policy. In United India Insurance Co.Ltd. Vs. Sidharat Raju and others, 2014 (3) PLR 736, it was observed that Deceased step into the shoe of the owner of the vehicle in question, therefore, the claimants cannot be stated to be third party for the purpose of awarding the compensation under the Act- The benefits of the insurance policy is restricted to the personal insurance cover to the owner and personal accident cover is a contract between the insured and the insurer and only designed to give the benefit to the insured and not to the borrower- The Lrs of the third party cannot claim the benefit of the death of the owner- However the claimants are entitled to get an amount of Rs.50,000/- as compensation under no fault liability provided under section 140 of the Act. SAPNA ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 15 11 I have considered the rival contentions put forth by learned counsel for parties and have perused the entire record meticulously. After thorough examination, it is observed that claimants being legal heirs of deceased Ravinder Kumar neither disclosed particulars of offending vehicle etc nor deceased was registered owner of accidental vehicle. It is admitted case of claimants that unknown truck 'being driven by unknown driver hit the motorcycle bearing registration No. HR-54-C-0569 as a consequence, rider namely Ravinder Kumar fell down and received serious injuries and unknown driver of said truck ran away along with truck from the place of accident and thereafter Ravinder Kumar was succumbed to his injuries. It is undiputed that registered owner of accidental motorcycle i.e respondent no.1 has already received damages of motorcycle to the tune of Rs.5400/- from respondent No.2 under insurance policy. There is only involved question whether Ravinder Kumar {deceased} shall step into shoe of registered owner of accidental vehicle as per insurance policy Ex.R2 in the name of registered owner Respondent no.1 Krishan Lal, who is brother of deceased. Although, insurance company received a sum of Rs.50/- on account of personal accident claim of registered owner/ driver and so if owner while driving the insured vehicle met with an motor vehicular accident, then he or his first class legal heirs in case of death may entitle to claim compensation against own insurance company under comprehensive policy but in all respect personal accident claim is restricted to the registered owner/driver. The word driver does not authorize any other person to drive vehicle SAPNA ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 16 under shoe of registered owner rather it reflects owner/driver to the extent of personal assessment of registered owner/driver. Nothing has been pleaded that as to how and on what basis deceased shall step in to shoe of registered owner whose claim is restricted to his personal accident claim. The word personal means the person who being registered owner got insured the vehicle and in case of any happening he may claim insurance from company under comprehensive policy which is absolutely limited to its registered owner and in case death of owner it can be extended upto his first class dependent legal heirs only. Here, claimants being legal heirs of occupant/driver of accident vehicle without disclosing the identity of offending vehicle etc want to claim compensation against respondent No.2 Insurance company under shoe of registered owner i.e respondent no.1 who has already received compensation of Rs. 5400/- on account of damage of accidental vehicle. In New India Assurance Company Limited Vs. Sadanand Mukhi and others 2009 (2) SCC 417{SC} , it was observed that as per section 147 of the M.V .Act :- the contract of insurance of a motor vehicle is governed by the provisions of the Insurance Act. By taking an 'act policy' the owner of a vehicle fulfills his statutory obligation as contained under Section 147 of the Act. It was also observed that only because driving of a motor vehicle may cause accident involving loss of life and property not only of a third party but also the owner of the vehicle and the insured vehicle itself, different provisions have been made in the Insurance Act as also the Act laying down different types of Insurance policies. In Ningamma SAPNA ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 17 and another Vs. United India Insurance Co.Ltd (Supra), it was observed that in a petition under section 163-A of the Act, the compensation is payable to third party, involved in the accident. As such, claimant in the present case is not a third party. Liability under section 163-A is on the owner of the vehicle. So, a person cannot be both, a claimant as also a recipient, with respect to claim. Undisputedly, the payment on account of personal accident claim can be given to the person duly covered under the insurance policy and not to anybody else including brother of the person covered under such a policy. 12 It is undisputed that deceased was neither registered owner of accidental vehicle nor his claim is covered under personal accident claim under comprehensive policy which is restricted or limited upto owner/ driver and so this word driver in the policy would not infer that any other occupant/driver being third person would also cover under the insurance policy which is apparently restricted to its registered owner or in case of death of registered owner it may extend to dependent first class legal heir as the case may be. Mere mentioning role of offending vehicle without identifying relevant particulars may raise questions whether accident was occurred due to own rash and negligence driving of motor cycle without having any valid licence or accident was occurred due to one reason or other as no one had seen the accident or it was a case of skid of motorcycle or any unknown vehicle hit the motor cycle. However, question of death of Ravinder Kumar by involvement of accidental vehicle can not be disbelieved, because respondent no.2 insurance SAPNA ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 18 company has already paid compensation on account of damage of motor cycle to claimant. However, legal representatives of occupant/driver of motor cycle under shoe of registered owner i.e respondent no.1 can not be held entitle to get compensation against insurance company under section 163-A of Act. Each case must be settled on its own facts and it would not be appropriate to lay down any general rule and further no straight jacket formula can be applied in each case. The crux of the matter is that claimants being legal heirs are not covered under insurance policy EX.R2 which was between respondent no. 1 and respondent no.2 and so respondent no.1 can not shift his liability upon respondent no.2 under the policy which is restricted to himself under personal accident claim only. This approach is in consonance with justice, otherwise, it will be sheer injustice and will encourage the frivolous claim petition against insurance company and general principle of law is that it should not be encouraged. Consequently, this tribunal has thus come to the conclusion that legal heirs of deceased Ravinder Kumar are not entitled to any compensation under section 163 A of Act. Accordingly, issue no.1 is decided in favour of claimants and issue no.2&5 are decided against them. ISSUE NO.3,4 & 6 : 13The onus to prove these issues are upon Respondents but they neither pressed these issue nor led any evidence. In this way, it has become obvious on file that this tribunal has left with no other option except to decide these issues against Respondents. Accordingly, all these SAPNA ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 19 issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.7 (RELIEF): 14 In view of the foregoing discussion emanating from record, instant claim petition stands dismissed with costs. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly and file be consigned to records after due compliance. Announced in open Court.

S. Ahluwalia, Advocate for claimant. Shri S.K. Mehndiratta, Advocate for respondent No.1. Shri Jaideep Prasher, Counsel for respondent No.2. AWARD:- This petition is preferred u/s 166 of MV Act seeking compensation of Rs.8 lacs on account of injuries and permanent disability sustained by claimant in a Motor Vehicular Accident, which took place on 16.08.2014, at about 05:00 a.m, in the area of Police Station Mullana and FIR bearing No. 169 dated 16.08.2014 u/ss 279 and 337 of IPC was registered against respondent no.1. SAHIL MALIK VS RASHEED ETC 2 2The necessary facts leading to accident in question are that on 15.08.2014 at about 8.00 PM, the claimant had gone to Mohali for his personal work in his Alto Car No. HR02X0934 and after completing his work, he started back journey in the night and was driving his car on his correct left side of the road at a moderate speed. His two known persons namely Robila alias Hinna d/o Ashok Sharma, resident of Yamuna Nagar and Sandeep Kaur resident of Amritsar were also sitting in his car and at about 5.00 AM on 16.08.2014, when he reached in the area of Police Station Mullana, District Ambala, meanwhile, a truck bearing registration No. HR-38-C-5088 'being driven by respondent No.1 so rashly and negligently, came from opposite side i.e. Yamuna Nagar side and by coming on the extreme wrong side of the road, struck the truck into his car and after causing the accident, respondent No.1 ran away from the spot. He suffered multiple, simple and grievous injuries. Other occupants also suffered injuries and all the injured were shifted to M. M. Medical College & Hospital Mullana, where the claimant remained under treatment for several days as indoor patient and he is still under treatment as outdoor patient and by this time, he spent more than Rs.50,000/- on his treatment, diet and transportation etc. So far as personal status of claimant is concerned; he is unmarried young boy of 24 years of age and at the time of accident, he was student of B.A. 2nd year. He was very active, smart and brilliant student, but on account of the injuries suffered by him in this accident, he has become permanently disabled and is confined to bed and is not in a SAHIL MALIK VS RASHEED ETC 3 position to attend his lectures and his studies is being effected. The future of the claimant has totally been ruined and the injuries also resulted into his dis-figuration & adversely affected his matrimonial alliance. The claimant has to suffer acute pain and sufferings during his treatment and will have to suffer acute pain and sufferings throughout his life. This accident was occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of truck bearing registration No. HR-38-C-5088 by respondent no.1. The offending vehicle is insured with respondent no.2, therefore, both the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation. 3Upon notice, respondents no.1 and 2 filed written statement separately. Respondent no.1 took preliminary objection regarding maintainability and this petition is bad for non joinder of owner and insurer of Alto Car No. HR-02X-0934. On merit, it is submitted that no accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of truck bearing registration No. HR-38-C-5088 by the respondent No.1 at about 5.00 AM on 16.08.2014 within the area of Police Station Mullana, but the police has falsely implicated the respondent No.1 as well as the aforesaid truck in the alleged FIR No.169 dated 16.08.2014, just to extract money under the garb of compensation. The claimant did not suffer alleged injuries due to the rash and negligent driving of truck bearing registration No. HR-38- C-5088. The compensation as claimed is exaggerated one. However, answering respondent is not responsible to pay any compensation. It is all a concocted story invented for the frame of this petition and to extract compensation at a higher side. More over, the police at the instances and SAHIL MALIK VS RASHEED ETC 4 instigation of claimant has falsely implicated the respondent No.1 as well as aforesaid truck in a false case of accident. The alleged accident, if any, took place due to own negligence of the claimant while driving his Car No. HR-02X-0934, rashly and negligently and as such, the claimant is not entitled to any compensation and prayed for dismissal the same with costs. 4Respondent No.2 Insurance Company filed written statement controverting the contents made in the petition and took preliminary objections to the effect that claim petition is not maintainable against the answering respondent because the driver was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident; respondent No.1 has neither placed on record nor supplied any copy of DL/RC, fitness and route permit etc. to answering respondent and accordingly there is grave violation on the part of driver/owner of vehicle; that no policy particulars have been supplied to the answering respondent either by the claimants or by respondent No.1 and in the absence of the proving the said documents, the factum of insurance is not proved; that answering respondent reserve its right to take all defences and pleas available to respondents No.1 and 2, the owner and driver of the alleged motorcycle under section 134(C), 147, 149, 157 and 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 along with section 64 VB of Insurance Act, 1938 and in terms of the policy of insurance. The monthly income, amount claimed, manner of accident and involvement of insured vehicle etc are vehemently objected by the answering respondent. The present claim petition has been filed by the claimant in connivance SAHIL MALIK VS RASHEED ETC 5 and collusion with respondent No.1 in order to extract compensation. On merit, it is submitted that insured vehicle has been involved just to extract the money from the answering respondent insurance company. Respondent No.1 driver was not having a valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident and accordingly there is grave violation on the part of driver/ owner of vehicle and thus claim petition qua answering respondent is liable to be dismissed, hence, prayed for dismissal with costs. 5Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following issues are framed vide order dated 15.02.2016:- 1Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1 while driving Truck bearing registration No. HR-38-C-5088 resulting into causing injuries to claimant Sahil Malik, as alleged ? OPP. 2If Issue No 1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom, the claimant is entitled to ? OPP. 3Whether petition is not maintainable in the present form ? OPR 4Whether the petition is bad for for non joinder and mis joinder of necessary parties ? OPR 5Whether the claimant has not come to the court with clean hands and has suppressed true and material facts from the court, if so, its effect ? OPR 6Whether respondent No.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect ? OPR 7Whether respondent No.2 is entitled to take all the defences available to it under the M. V . Act ? OPR 8Relief SAHIL MALIK VS RASHEED ETC 6 6 To establish his claim through this inquiry, in evidence, claimant stepped into witness box as PW1 and tendered affidavit Ex.PW1/A reiterating the contents mentioned in the petition. He also tendered documents Ex.P1 to Ex.P33 Medical treatment record/Bills; Ex.P34 MLR; Ex.P35 Charge-sheet; Ex.P36 report under section 173 Cr.P.C; Ex.P37 copy of DL; Ex.P38 bill in his evidence. In cross- examination, he answered that he is graduate and doing job of sales man in crockery shop. The Alto car No. HR-02X-0934 is owned by his friend namely Sagar Kumar which was damaged in the said accident. He started his journey to Mohali at 8.00 PM from Yamuna Nagar on 15.08.2014 and reached the Mohali at about 10.30 PM. He had gone to Mohali to pick his friend Robila Sharma and her friend Sandeep Kaur. He had started his journey from Mohali to Yamuna Nagar at 2.00 PM on 16.08.2014. They did not halt anywhere from Mohali to the place of accident. He reached Ambala at 3.45 AM. The distance from Ambala to place of accident is about 40-45 KM. He reached Mullana at about 4.45 AM. He had taken rest after reaching Mohali till 1.30 AM. He was discharged from MM Hospital on the same day in the evening. He had suffered two fractures on his right leg one at knee and right thigh and other injuries were on his face and right arm. He had taken treatment at Aggarwal Ortho Centre, Jagadhri where he remained admitted from 16.8.2014 to 24.08.2014 and still he was getting treatment as outdoor patient for last nine months. He had not obtained any reimbursement of Rs.5263/- from any other authority. He was also cross-examined on other SAHIL MALIK VS RASHEED ETC 7 questions. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent No. 1 tendered copy of DL of respondent No.1 as Ex.R1, RC of vehicle as Ex.R2, fitness certificate as Ex.R3, insurance policy as Ex.R4, copy of chit as Ex.R5 and closed his evidence. Learned counsel for respondent No. 2 tendered copy of insurance policy Ex.R6, copy of Public information as Mark-RA and closed the evidence. In rebuttal evidence, claimant tendered disability certificate EX.PX and closed the same. 7I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1: 8Onus to prove this issue is upon claimant. Under this issue, petitioner- claimant is required to prove the fact that motor vehicular accident was occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Truck bearing registration No. HR-38-C-5088 by Respondent no.1, resulting into multiple grievous injuries attributed to him and as such, he is entitled to appropriate compensation from respondents. Learned counsel for the petitioner-claimant has submitted that PW1 Sahil Malik has proved the fact that respondent no.1, drove truck bearing registration No. HR-38-C- 5088, so rashly and negligently and in high speed and hit to his Alto car, as a result of that, he and other occupants received multiple grievous injuries and then, FIR No.162 dated 16.08.2014 under Sections 279 and 337 of IPC was registered against respondent no.1. He further submitted that accident in question was taken place due to sole rash and negligent SAHIL MALIK VS RASHEED ETC 8 driving of offending vehicle by respondent no.1 and prayed for deciding this issue in favour of claimant. 9 On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent no.1 has argued that no accident was taken place with the offending vehicle belonging to respondent No.1, rather, claimant sustained injuries due to his own sole rash and negligent driving of Alto Car bearing registration No. HR-01X-0934 and so, respondent no.1 in not liable and prayed for deciding this issue against claimant. Learned counsel for respondent no.2 has argued that no accident was taken place with the offending vehicle belonging to respondent No.1, rather, claimant sustained injuries due to his own sole rash and negligent driving of Alto Car bearing registration No. HR-01x-0934 and so, respondent no.2 should not be held liable and prayed for deciding this issue against claimant. 10I have given due regard to the rival contentions put forth by learned counsel for respective parties and have evaluated the entire oral evidence coupled with documentary evidence carefully. After thorough examination, it is observed that the petitioner-claimant has come to this Tribunal with categorical stand that the accident was taken place due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle i.e. truck bearing registration No. HR-38-C-5088 by Respondent No.1, resulting into multiple grievous injuries attributed to claimant. In order to prove factum of accident, PW1 {claimant- injured} deposed on similar line according to contents mentioned in the petition. Although, PW1 has been cross-examined, but nothing adverse can be extracted disbelieving the factual position of SAHIL MALIK VS RASHEED ETC 9 motor vehicular accident, rather, no suggestion was put forth relating to manipulation of contents while lodging FIR. Further it is evident on record that respondent no.1 has been facing trial as per final report u/s Cr.P.C 173 Ex.P36 and Charge-sheet Ex.P35 as evident on file . 11It is quite well settled that the lodging of first information report is not an essential prerequisite for claiming compensation arising from a motor accident. Each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The Tribunal has to decide the case on the basis of evidence available on file without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled preposition of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. It must be remembered that in a criminal case, prosecution is required to prove its case beyond shadow of reasonable doubt. However, in a motor accident claim, the claimant is not required to prove the case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. The claimant is required to establish that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts upon the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way alleged by the claimant. The provisions regarding claim under the Act are enacted by keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimant is always entitled for compensation irrespective whether the police has registered the offence regarding the incident or not because no claim case can be left over on the mercy of the police. The SAHIL MALIK VS RASHEED ETC 10 respondent no.1, did not appear in the witness box to rebut the stand of petitioner-claimant reasons best known to him. In this way, it can be easily said that petitioner-claimant received multiple injuries in the motor vehicular accident due to rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1, who has been facing trial as per final report u/s Cr.P.C 173 Ex.P36 and Charge-sheet Ex.P35 as evident on file . In view of law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993(2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008(2) R.C.R. (civil) 774 , and entire facts and circumstances involved therein, this Tribunal is of the considered opinion that there is cogent evidence on file to reach the formidable conclusion that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. Accordingly, issued no.1 is decided in favour of petitioner-claimant. ISSUE NO.2: 12Onus to prove this issue is upon claimant. Under this issue, petitioner- claimant is required to establish that as to what amount of compensation should be assessed. Learned counsel for claimant has submitted that claimant was taken to M.M. Medical college and Hospital, Mullana from where he was discharge on the same evening. Further, claimant got treatment from where he remained admitted for nine days. He is confined to bed since the day of accident and his disability has been assessed as per certificate EX.PX. He further pointed out that he spent a total sum of Rs.69227/- according to medical bills EX.P1 to EX.P33 on his treatment. The age of claimant at the time of accident was 24 years SAHIL MALIK VS RASHEED ETC 11 and was earning handsome monthly income, therefore, claimant is entitled to appropriate compensation from both respondents, who are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to him. 13 On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents no.1 has argued that offending vehicle was owned by respondent no.1 as per RC, which was insured with respondent no.2 vide Insurance Policy Ex.R6. He further argued that respondent no.1 was holding valid driving license EX.R2 and fitness certificate of offending vehicle at the relevant time of accident and so, respondent no.2 is liable to indemnify the claim, if it is awarded. Learned counsel for respondent no.2 has submitted that respondent no.1 did not produce any route permit and so he violated terms and condition of insurance policy. He lastly submitted that t he claim amount is highly exaggerated and manipulated just to extract exorbitant amount of compensation from insurance company and prayed for deciding this issue against claimant. 14Having considered the contention and perusing the record, it is apparent that claimant sustained multiple injuries in this accident. It is evident that claimant remained admitted as indoor patient for ten days. According to medical bills Ex.P1 to Ex.P33, it can be gathered that a sum of Rs.69,227/- (in round figure Rs.69,500/-) were spent on his treatment. Further period of ten days admission in the hospital cannot be doubted. Additionally, claimant must have spent some amount on account of rich diet, attendants, transportation, visitors, follow up treatment etc. In Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences versus Prasanth S.Dhananka, 2010 ACJ SAHIL MALIK VS RASHEED ETC 12 38 (SC), by the three-Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court, it was observed that sympathy for the victim does not, and should not, come in the way of making a correct assessment, but if a case is made out, the Court must not be chary of awarding adequate compensation. It was further observed that the case of an injured and disabled person is, however, more pitiable and the feeling of hurt, helplessness, despair and often destitution ensues every day. The support that is needed by a severely handicapped person comes at an enormous price, physical, financial and emotional, not only on the victim but even more so on his family and attendants and the stress saps their energy and destroys their equanimity. In Raj Kumar versus Ajay Kumar, 2011 ACJ-1- (SC); it was observed that a person is not only to be compensated for the physical injury, but also for the loss which he suffered as a result of such injury. This means that he is to be compensated for his inability to lead a full life, his inability to enjoy those normal amenities which he would have enjoyed but for the injuries, and his inability to earn as much as he used to earn or could have earned. 15 It is further made clear that he received physical permanent disability to the extent of 15 percent as per disability certificate EX.PX and was also advised bed rest. In view of extent of physical disability and its nature when examined in the light of Judgment in Ram Kiran Goyal vs Sub Divisional engineer, mechanical and other 2008{2} RCR {Civil} 103, claimant is entitled to Rs.30,000/- @ 2000/- per percent. 16 In view of overall facts and circumstances arising out in this SAHIL MALIK VS RASHEED ETC 13 petition, this Tribunal finds justification in assessing compensation according to injuries attributed to claimant as per settled preposition of law in Raj Kumar Vs Ajay Kumar, (2011)1 SCC 343 , the petitioner- claimant is held entitled to the following compensation: Pecuniary damages (Special damages) 15% permanent disability; Rs. 30,000/- (i).Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and miscellaneous expenditure.Rs.69,500 /-plus 10000/- {Rs.1000/- per day as indoor patient} including all expenses. (ii).Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising: (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment; (b) Loss of future earning on account of injuries etc. 5000/- nil (iii). Future medical expenses. 10,000/ - None-pecuniary damages (General damages) (iv). Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries. 10 000/- (v). Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage). Nil (vi).Loss of expectation of life ( shortening of normal longevity). nil /- Total Compensation Rs.134,500/- 17 The petitioner is also entitled to interest @ 7.5% per annum on the total awarded compensation amount from the date of filing of petition till realization. The computation of compensation is just, equitable, fair and reasonable. Remaining relief sought by petitioner- claimant stands declined. Accordingly, Issue no.2 is decided in the above stated terms, in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents. SAHIL MALIK VS RASHEED ETC 14 ISSUE NO.3 to 5 & 7 : 18The onus to prove these issues is upon Respondents, but they neither pressed these issues nor led any evidence. Further it has been discussed in detail under issue no.1, that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and thus it can not be said that no accident was taken place with offending vehicle or the instant claim petition is not maintainable etc. In this way, it has become obvious for this tribunal that respondents failed to prove these issues and as such this tribunal has left with no other option except to decide the same against Respondents. Accordingly, these issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.6: 19The onus to prove this issue is upon the respondent No.2, who is under the obligation to prove this fact that the respondent No.1 was not having a valid route permit at the day of alleged accident and as such respondent no. 1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy/cover note EX.R6 and so respondent No.2 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimants. Unquestioned, respondents 1 has duly produced fitness certificate of vehicle plying on the public road as owner. Needless to state that Insurance Policy Ex.R6 reveals that offending vehicle as per RC was insured with the respondent No.2 at the relevant time. There is no iota of evidence, whereby, it may say that offending vehicle was using for commercial purpose. In the fact and circumstances, both respondents are held jointly and severally liable to SAHIL MALIK VS RASHEED ETC 15 pay the compensation amount to claimant and respondent no.2 shall indemnify the insured. Accordingly, this Issue is decided against the respondent No.2. ISSUE NO.8 (RELIEF): PETITION SUCCEED S 20In view of the foregoing discussion, instant claim petition stands allowed with costs in a manner that the claimant-petitioner is entitled to compensation of Rs.1,34,500/ - along with interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition till the date of actual payment. The awarded amount along with interest shall be payable jointly and severally by Respondents and respondent no.2 shall indemnify the insured. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.3000/-.

Mohinder Bindal, counsel for respondent No.1. Respondents No.1 and 2 exparte. J U D G E M E N T: This claim petition under Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act Jagjit Singh, MACT Nand Kishore Vs.Parvinder Singh etc. 2 for grant of compensation on account of injuries sustained in a Motor vehicle accident, has been filed by the claimants. 2)Brief facts of the claim petition are that on 04.11.2013 the injured Nand Kishore was going on his scooter bearing No.HR-01L-3689 from DRM Office towards Ambala Cantt Railway Station. At about 3.45 P.M. when he reached near Shastri Colony cut on the G.T. Road, a Ford Figo car bearing registration No.HR-54B-2006 being driven by respondent no.1 in a very rash and negligent manner and at a high speed came from behind and overtook the scooter of the claimant and applied sudden brake in front of the scooter. The claimant also applied brake of his scooter but the scooter struck with the car from behind and as a result of which the claimant fell down and received head injuries. The injured took treatment from PGI, Chandigarh, where he remained admitted from 04.11.2013 to 21.11.2014 and the injured had spent huge amount on his treatment, special diet etc. Matter was reported to the police and FIR was registered against respondent no.1. The accident has taken place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. Lastly, it was prayed that compensation amount to the tune of Rs.20,00,000/- be awarded to him on account of injuries sustained by him along with interest @ 18% per annum, from the date of filing of the petition till its realization, for which respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation. Jagjit Singh, MACT Nand Kishore Vs.Parvinder Singh etc. 3 3)The respondents No.1 and 2 being owner and driver of the offending vehicle filed written statements and denied the averments made in the petition and stated that no accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1, however, a false and frivolous FIR was registered against the respondent no.1 just to fetch the claim. All other material averments were denied and lastly prayed for dismissal of the petition. 4)Respondent No.3 Insurance Company of the offending vehicle contested the petition by filing separate written statement and it was submitted that driver of the offending vehicle/respondent No.1 was not having valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident and insured willfully violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. The factum of accident as alleged by the claimant in the petition was denied and submitted that a false and manipulated FIR has been got registered by the claimant against the respondent no.1 in collusion with the police. Also, the factum of rash and negligence of the offending vehicle was denied. Remaining contents of the petition were denied and prayer to dismiss the petition was made. 5)Replication was not filed. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed :- 1.Whether the accident in question causing injuries to Jagjit Singh, MACT Nand Kishore Vs.Parvinder Singh etc. 4 the claimant Nand Kishore took place due to rash and negligent driving of car bearing registration No.HR- 54B-2006 by respondent no.1, as alleged? OPP. 2.If issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation the claimant is entitled to and from whom? OPP. 3.Whether the insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation, in view of the preliminary objections raised in the written statement and whether there has been a breach of terms and conditions of the policy of insurance? OPR-3. 4.Relief. 6)In support of their case, claimant no.2 herself appeared in the witness box as PW-1 and also examined Madan Lal as PW-2, Dr. Ravi Chauhan as PW-3, Kewal Kishan as PW-4, Rajinder Kumar as PW-5 and Dr. Rajesh Chhabra as PW-6. Besides oral evidence, the following documents were placed on record:- Ex.P-1 :FIR Ex.P-2 :Insurance Policy Ex.P-3 :R.C. Ex.P-4 :D.L. Ex.P-5 :Report u/s 173 Cr.P.C. Ex.P-6 :Seizre Memo Ex.P-7 & Ex.P-8 :Mechanical Reports Ex.P-8 :MLR Jagjit Singh, MACT Nand Kishore Vs.Parvinder Singh etc. 5 Ex.P-9 :Crime Detail Form Ex.P-10 & P-11 :Salary Clips Ex.P-12 :Salary Details Ex.P-13 :Disability Certificate Mark-1 to 6 :Copies of Photographs Thereafter, ld. Counsel for the petitioner closed the evidence. 7)On the other hand, the respondent no.3 has not led any evidence despite availing several effective opportunities. 8)No evidence in rebuttal was led by the petitioner. 9)I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the material placed on record. My issue-wise finding are given as under:- ISSUE No.1:- 10)The onus of proving this issue was on the petitioners and to prove the same, learned counsel for the petitioners argued that in the present case on 04.12.2013 Nand Kishore was going on his scooter at about 3.45 P.M. and when he reached near Shastri turn, a car bearing No.HR-54-B-2006 crossed the scooter of Nand Kishore and suddenly applied brakes in front of him and as a result the scooter hit into the car and fell down and Nand Kishore received serious injuries and was taken to the hospital and he almost become 100% disabled. The occurrence was Jagjit Singh, MACT Nand Kishore Vs.Parvinder Singh etc. 6 witnessed by PW-2, who got the FIR registered and the FIR mentions the number of offending car and the respondent no.1 was driving the same and facing trial for the said offence. PW-4 has deposed regarding the trial being faced by respondent no.1. It was argued that the eye-witness PW-2 has also deposed in detail as to how the accident was caused and thus the injured who has become 100% disabled and filed the petition through his wife is entitled to compensation accordingly. 11)Learned counsel for respondent no.3 meanwhile argued that no such accident was ever caused in the present case and the respondents no.1 and 2 are colluding with the claimants to file the present false claim petition. It was argued that there was a delay of almost 13 days in getting the FIR registered despite the fact that the witnesses deposed regarding their statements having been recorded by the police on the day of accident itself on 04.11.2013. It was argued that it was injured himself who caused the accident by hitting his scooter in the car going in front of him and he was required to maintain a safe distance from the same. The eye-witness, PW-2, has stated that on the very same day they had informed the police and his statement was recorded and on material points he does not support the testimony of the wife of injured, PW-1. It was argued that the doctor, PW-3, has stated that as per history given at the time of admission of patient he was said to have suffered Jagjit Singh, MACT Nand Kishore Vs.Parvinder Singh etc. 7 injuries while going on a two-wheeler and having been hit by an unknown vehicle. It was argued that apart from this the injured and his eye- witness were not appearing in the trial court to depose in the court since they want to get the claim in this false claim petition and then to resile in the trial court. This becomes clear from the testimony of PW-4, who brought the file of trial court wherein arrest warrants have been issued of the son of the injured and the injured himself. It was thus, argued that there is no merit in the present claim petition filed which deserves dismissal. 12)I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the file carefully. 13)A perusal of the petition filed shows that it is the contention of the petitioner that on 04.11.2013 Nand Kishore was going on his scooter towards Ambala Cantt Railway Station and there was a car driven by respondent no.1 which came from the side of the injured and overtook the scooter and suddenly applied brakes in front of him. The claimant as a result struck his scooter into the car and fell down and received injuries. 14)It is seen that this happened on 04.11.2013 but FIR in the present case has only been got registered on 17.11.2013. Although Jagjit Singh, MACT Nand Kishore Vs.Parvinder Singh etc. 8 perusal of the FIR shows that a medical ruka was received by the police on 04.11.2013 and they visited hospital and PGI on 06.11.2013, 08.11.2013 and 15.11.2013 and injured was never found fit to make statement, but it is seen that it was not required for the complainant party that the injured himself gets the FIR registered or inform the manner in which the accident was caused, since the testimony of PW-2 shows that he claims to be eye-witness of the occurrence. In his cross-examination PW-2 has stated that the injured was his brother and was taken immediately to Civil Hospital from the spot and he on his part informed the police. Despite serious injuries having been suffered by the brother of PW-2 he has stated in his cross- examination that he did not accompany his brother to Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt, and rather injured was taken to the hospital by the police. This would mean that the police had reached at the spot itself. This witness further says that from Civil Hospital the injured was referred to PGI, Chandigarh and he alongwith wife of the injured also reached in PGI at the same time, whereas the wife of injured says that she alongwith her daughter had gone to Civil Hospital, Ambala and when her husband was referred to PGI, Chandigarh, they went with him in the same ambulance and PW-2 also accompanied them in the same ambulance. PW-2 further says that the police had met him on the same day of accident Jagjit Singh, MACT Nand Kishore Vs.Parvinder Singh etc. 9 and he had immediately informed the police about the accident but despite this the delay of 13 days could not be explained. PW-2 further says that he informed the police about the manner of accident and also about offending vehicle on the day of accident itself and also disclosed his mobile number and also got his statement recorded on the next day of accident in PGI, Chandigarh. Despite this the FIR is only registered after 13 days which would mean that no such statement was got recorded by PW-2 and the doctor PW-3 also goes to depose that as per history given at the time of admission of patient in PGI, Chandigarh it was informed that he suffered injuries while going on a two-wheeler and having been hit by an unknown vehicle. If PW-2 was all alone aware about the vehicle involved and the manner of the accident, then there was no mention in the history as deposed by doctor PW-3. 15)All these circumstances clearly go to show that the claimant do not seem to have come to the court with clean hands and the accident as claimed to have happened has not happened in such manner. Accordingly, issue no.1 is decided against the claimants. ISSUE NO.2: 16)Keeping in view of my findings on issue no.1 the claimants do not become entitled to any compensation in the present case and this Jagjit Singh, MACT Nand Kishore Vs.Parvinder Singh etc. 10 issue is accordingly decided against the claimants. ISSUE NO.3: 17)Keeping in view of my findings on issues no.1 and 2, learned counsel for respondent no.3 did not press this issue and this issue is accordingly decided against the respondent no.3. RELIEF: 18)Keeping in view of my findings on issues no.1 to 3, the present claim petition is hereby dismissed with costs. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly. File be consigned to record room after due compliance. Pronounced in open Court (JAGJIT SINGH) Dated: 22.07.2016 Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ambala.

The brief facts as per the claim petition are that on 30.3.2015 at about 7.00 P.M., Sher Singh (since deceased) was going from his (Devinder Singh), Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ambala. 09.08.2016.

V ATAN SHARMA AND ANRs. -3- village to Naraingarh with one Labh Singh(his business partner) on motor cycle no.HR01-V-5542 being driven by Labh Singh to his correct hand side of the road, and when they reached in the area of village Lakhnoura Near Andhri Bus stand, in the mean-while respondent no.1 while driving swift car no.HR-01-X-9099 came from Naraingarh side in a very negligent, careless and in zigzag manner at a very high speed without blowing any horn and after coming on its wrong side struck against the motor cycle of deceased and due to this impact the deceased Sher Singh and Labh Singh both fell down on hard road after tossing up and the both received multiple injuries on their head and all over body and both died at the spot instantly. Ranpal son of Shri Amarnath witnessed the accident as he was just behind the deceased on his separate motor cycle No.HR-04-E- 0139 with one Sandeep Kumar and he noticed registration number of car in question but the respondent no.1 i.e. driver of Car fled away from the spot leaving behind the car at the spot.

The deceased Sher Singh was also an active, young, good and caring husband, father and a son but due to the said accident the future life and future dreams of claimants are ruined. The said accident has taken place due to rash and negligent manner of driving of the car driver i.e. respondent no.1 but one Raj Kumar in collusion with respondent no.1 in order to save him being his master misrepresented him to be the driver of the car on the date of accident.

BANTO DEVI AND OTHERS VS. V ATAN SHARMA AND ANRs. -10- 14. Vatan Sharma, the respondent no.1 did not step into the wit - ness box to rebut the evidence led by claimants. Learned counsel for the claimants has relied upon Raju & ors. Versus Sukhwinder Singh & ors. 2007(III) ACC page 254, wherein Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that “ driver of truck did not enter witness box to deny alle - gations of witness regarding his involvement in accident; adverse infer - ence can be drawn against him. Further it is absolutely necessary to have the first hand report from the driver. It may be that the driver does not al - ways speak the truth, but the driver's version is the one which is to be given the best consideration. He only knows as to what actually hap - pened. Therefore, the driver having not been examined, necessarily, an adverse inference arises against him ”. Learned counsel for the claimants has urged that fact of registration of FIR No. 71 dated 30.03.2015 under Sections 279/304-/427A IPC at Police Station Naraingarh as Ex.P1 against respondent no.1 is su fficient to arrive at the conclusion that accident in question had taken place due to negligence of Vatan Sharma, the respondent no. 1.

The contention of learned counsel for respondent no.2 that motor cycle driver had also contributed towards the accident is unacceptable, because it has nowhere come in evi - dence that driver of the motor cycle, was driving it rashly and negli - (Devinder Singh), Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ambala. 09.08.2016.

BANTO DEVI AND OTHERS VS. V ATAN SHARMA AND ANRs. -10- 14. Vatan Sharma, the respondent no.1 did not step into the wit - ness box to rebut the evidence led by claimants. Learned counsel for the claimants has relied upon Raju & ors. Versus Sukhwinder Singh & ors. 2007(III) ACC page 254, wherein Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that “ driver of truck did not enter witness box to deny alle - gations of witness regarding his involvement in accident; adverse infer - ence can be drawn against him. Further it is absolutely necessary to have the first hand report from the driver. It may be that the driver does not al - ways speak the truth, but the driver's version is the one which is to be given the best consideration. He only knows as to what actually hap - pened. Therefore, the driver having not been examined, necessarily, an adverse inference arises against him ”. Learned counsel for the claimants has urged that fact of registration of FIR No. 71 dated 30.03.2015 under Sections 279/304-/427A IPC at Police Station Naraingarh as Ex.P1 against respondent no.1 is su fficient to arrive at the conclusion that accident in question had taken place due to negligence of Vatan Sharma, the respondent no. 1. It is also held in Bimla Devi Versus Himachal Road Transport Corporation And oth - ers AIR 2009 SC 2819 that “ it is not possible to give strict proof of acci - dent by the claimants and they have to establish their case merely on touchstone of preponderance of probability ”.

M. Atri, counsel for the petitioners. Shri R.S. Baknaur, counsel for the respondent No.1 & 2. Shri J. S. Rathore, counsel for the respondent No.3. AWARD:- Claimants have brought t he instant petition 'under Section 166 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, for claiming compensation of Rs.45,00,000/- along with interest @ 18% per annum, on account of death of Sh. Mohinder Singh son of Sh. Bachan Singh, resident of Village Tamnouli, PO Nohni, Tehsil Barara, District Ambala, who died in a road side accident dated 15.04.2015 at about 8.30 P.M, which was taken place in front of Village Khudda Kalan, P.S. Mahesh Nagar, Tehsil Ambala Cantt, District Ambala, due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1, while driving Swift Car bearing Registration No. PB-30-M-0435 . A case bearing FIR No. 111 dated 16.04.2015 under sections 279, 304-A IPC was registered at Police Station, Mahesh Nagar,against the respondent No.1. The postmortem of dead body was conducted at Civil Hospital Ambala Cantt. 2The necessary facts for disposal of this claim petition 'with regard to accident, income and age of deceased, are that on 15.04.2015, Mohinder Singh (since deceased) was going from his Village Tamnouli, Tehsil Barara, District Ambala, to Indian Oil Ambala Cantt, for performing his duty as per instructions of his employer, on his motorcycle bearing registration No. HR-01-U-2296 at a moderate speed on the correct left hand side on berm of Jagadhri to Ambala Cantt road. Mohinder Singh PARAMJIT KAUR ETC VS PUNEET KUMAR ETC 3 was being followed by Balwant Singh S/o Mam Raj on separate Activa Scooter. At about 8.30 PM, when Mohinder Singh reached within the area of Village Khudda Kalan, in the mean time, a Swift Car bearing Registration No. PB-30-M-0435, being driven by its driver i.e. Respondent No.1 so rashly, negligently and in zig zag manner and in an uncontrollable speed, came from opposite side i.e Ambala Cantt side. On seeing the said car coming in such rash and negligent manners, Mohinder Singh slow down the speed of his motorcycle and took the same on the extreme left hand side of the road on kacha berm, but respondent No.1 while leaving entire 30-35 feet wide mettled road without blowing any horn, without giving any indicators, after coming on the extreme wrong side on kacha berm of the road, hit against motorcycle of Mohinder Singh. As a result of that, Mohinder Singh fell on the road side along with his motorcycle and suffered multiple, simple and grievous injuries including head injury and motorcycle was extensively damaged. Many persons gathered at the spot. Balwant Singh gave telephonic message to family members of Mohinder Singh and took injured in an ambulance to Civil Hospital Ambala Cantt from the spot. He was given first aid by the doctors of Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt and referred to PGI Chandigarh, but Mohinder Singh died on the way to PGI Chandigarh, on account of injuries suffered by him. This accident took place due to sole rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1/ driver of Swift Car bearing Registration No. PB-30-M-0435, which is owned by respondent No.2 and insured with respondent No.3. PARAMJIT KAUR ETC VS PUNEET KUMAR ETC 4 It is further the case of claimants that age of deceased was 50 years and he was working as a Security Guard with Proprietor of Shaash Security Services Ambala Cantt, on salary of Rs.12,000/- per month as permanent employee. Mohinder Singh was retired from Indian Army and was getting pension of Rs.12,000/- per month. Income of deceased was increasing year by year and after some time, his income was to cross the figure of Rs.35,000/- per month. For the purpose of assessment of income and dependency, his income may be considered as Rs.30,000/- per month. All the claimants were solely dependent on the income of the deceased and after his death, there is no one in his family to earn, maintain and support the claimants. Deceased was sole bread earner of his family. Claimant No.1 'being widow, is entitled for loss of consortium on account of death of her husband. Claimant No. 2 to 4 being children are entitled for loss of proper looking after, love and affection of their father. The claimants have spent more than Rs 50,000/- on transportation of dead body, funeral and last rites of the deceased. Hence, all respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the claimants . 3Upon notice, respondent No.1 and 2 filed written statement. They denied the entire facts mentioned in the claim petition. They submitted that claimants in connivance with the police lodged an FIR NO.111 dated 16.04.2015 under sections 279, 304-A IPC against the respondent No.1, only to get the compensation. No accident took place with the vehicle of the answering respondents. The deceased did not suffer any injury with the vehicle of the answering respondent. He might PARAMJIT KAUR ETC VS PUNEET KUMAR ETC 5 have suffered injuries in some other accident, but the vehicle of the answering respondents has been involved falsely only to get compensation. Since no accident took place with the vehicle of answering respondent, therefore, question of disclosing the particulars of insurance company does not arise at all. The claimants have claimed exaggerated amount of compensation despite no accident has been caused by the vehicle of the answering respondents and as such the claimants are not liable to claim any compensation by involving the vehicle of the answering respondents falsely. Answering respondents have no concern with the alleged accident, but their car has been involved falsely and prayed for dismissal the present petition. 4The respondent No.3 (insurance company) filed separate written statement controverting the assertions made in the petition and took some preliminary objections qua maintainability, cause of action; that the claim petition has been filed with malafide intention and in collusion with respondents No.1 and 2 only to extract compensation from the answering respondent; that the respondent No.1 was not having a valid and effective Driving licence and was driving the alleged vehicle at the time of the alleged accident without driving license, registration certificate, pollution certificate, fitness certificate and in violation of terms and conditions of the insurance policy; that no such accident has taken place on 15.04.2015; that the actual cause of alleged accident has been suppressed as such the answering respondent is not liable in any manner; that the claim petition has been filed after due consultation just to get PARAMJIT KAUR ETC VS PUNEET KUMAR ETC 6 compensation from the answering respondent on purely made up basis which is not sustainable in the eyes of law; that there was no privity contract of insurance between the owner of Swift car and the answering respondent on the date and time of alleged accident covering such type of claims and risks or any insurance policy as alleged was issued by the answering respondent; that the respondent reserves its right to take all defences and pleas available under section 147,148, 149, 167,169 and 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and in terms of the insurance policy; that this court has no jurisdiction to try and entertain the present claim petition. On merit, it is submitted that no record regarding age, income, profession of the deceased has been attached and as such if any record is submitted at belated stage, the same should not be taken into account, it being a fabricated document. It is denied that deceased was earning Rs.24,000/- per month and also doing service at Shaash Security Services Ambala Cantt. It is further submitted that no accident as alleged was taken place involving the alleged Swift Car bearing registration No. PB- 30-M-0435, however, a false FIR was lodged. No record regarding alleged age, occupation and income of the deceased has been placed on record. It is wrong that deceased suffered multiple, grievous and died due to injuries in the alleged accident with Swift Car bearing registration No. PB-30-M-0435. The actual cause of alleged accident has been suppressed as such the answering respondent is not liable in any manner. The amount claimed as compensation is much more exaggerated and imaginary one. Rests of facts are denied and prayed for dismissal the petition with costs. PARAMJIT KAUR ETC VS PUNEET KUMAR ETC 7 5Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed vide order dated 08.09.2015:- 1Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1 while driving Swift Car bearing registration No. PB-30-M-0435, resulting into causing death of Mohinder Singh, as alleged?

He stated that he has brought the computerized record of pensioners bearing seal and signatures of DPDO Ambala Cantt which is Ex.P2. According to record, in the month of March 2015, Mohinder Singh was getting pension from Indian Army vide PPO No. 85215896 through Punjab & Sind Bank Mullana. Copy of statement of account/ pension record is Ex.P3. The date of birth of Mohinder Singh is 03.05.1960 as per record. In cross-examination, he PARAMJIT KAUR ETC VS PUNEET KUMAR ETC 8 answered that after death of Mohinder Singh, his wife Smt. Paramjit Kaur is getting Rs.11524/- per month as pension till 2022 and at present in such like cases in supernatural age cases about Rs.3500/- per month and in the year 2022, this can be enhanced and never reduce. On 01.05.1997 pension of Mohinder Singh was Rs.439/- per month and since then pension of Mohinder Singh was increased from time to time. Lastly, Mohinder Singh was getting pension of Rs.5567/- per month along with Dearness allowance of 107%. He was also cross-examined on other questions. PW2 Subedar Major N. R.

No service is provided by their firm to the LRs of deceased on compassionate grounds. No financial help is provided to the LRs of the deceased after death of Mohinder Singh on 15.04.2015. In cross-examination, he answered that it is correct that as per their record, Mohinder Singh was their employee since January 2014. It is correct that Mohinder Singh PARAMJIT KAUR ETC VS PUNEET KUMAR ETC 9 was on contract for the period of two years from 01.01.2014 to 31.12.2015. Letter dated 23.08.2015 Ex.R1 bears signatures of Col. Jai Parkash Sharma. V olunteered, the amount mentioned in Ex.R1 is of salary account from 01.01.2014 to 15.04.2015 which has been paid to wife of deceased. He was also cross-examined on other questions. PW3 Paramjit Kaur (widow of deceased) tendered her affidavit Ex.PW3/A stating therein that Mohinder Singh left behind as his widow (herself), claimants No.2 and 3 aged 25 & 23 (as daughters) claimant No.4 aged 21 years (son) who are only his legal heirs and dependents. In cross-examination, she answered that it is correct that she is not eye witness to the accident. Her husband was about two years elder to her. It is incorrect to suggest that she and her children were not dependent on the income of her deceased husband. Her husband was retired from Indian Army in the year 1997-98. She is getting pension of Rs.12,000/- per month. After death of her husband, now she is getting pension of Rs.6000/- per month. It is incorrect that after death of her husband, she is getting pension of Rs.11,524/- per month. She was also cross-examined on other questions. PW4 Balwant Singh (eye witness) tendered his affidavit Ex.PW4/A proving the factum of accident. In cross-examination, he answered that deceased Mohinder Singh was his brother-in-law (Jija). It is incorrect to suggest that the Swift Car bearing registration No. PB-30- M-0435, was not being driven by respondent No.1 so rashly, negligently and in zig zag manner. It is incorrect that the accident in question had PARAMJIT KAUR ETC VS PUNEET KUMAR ETC 10 taken place due to negligence of deceased Mohinder Singh. It is incorrect to suggest that no accident had taken place with Car bearing registration No. PB-30-M-0435 being driven by respondent No.1. The driver had fled from the spot leaving offending car on the spot. It is incorrect that he had not witnessed the alleged accident. It is incorrect that false FIR has been registered against respondent No.1,involving Car bearing registration No. PB-30-M-0435 in order to help the claimants. He cannot tell the names and addresses of the persons gathered on the spot. He was also cross-examined on other questions.

However, no evidence was led by respondent No.3 despite availing sufficient opportunities, therefore, evidence of respondent No.3 was closed by court order. No rebuttal evidence was led and same was closed on 15.12.2015. 7I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on various issues are as under: ISSUE NO.1: PARAMJIT KAUR ETC VS PUNEET KUMAR ETC 11 8 Under this issue, claimants-petitioners are required to establish fact that motor vehicular accident was occurred 'due to sole rash and negligent driving of Respondent no.1, resulting, death of Mohinder Singh and as such, they being first class legal heirs and dependents are entitled to appropriate compensation from respondents who are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation amount. 9 Learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that accident in question was taken place due to sole rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1, resulting death of Mohinder Singh, therefore, respondent No.1, driver, respondent No.2 owner and respondent no.3 insurer, are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the petitioners and prayed for allowing the petition.In support to his contentions, learned counsel for claimants placed reliance upon following case laws:- In Lal Dei and others Vs. Himachal Road Transport Corporation and another, 2008 ACJ 1107 , it was observed that deductions- Family pension- Whether family pension amount is deductible while computing dependency of the claimants- Held: No; heirs receive family pension even otherwise than due to accidental death. In Netaji Subhash Institute of Technology Vs Alka Ahuja and others, 2011 ACJ 370, it has been observed that Fatal accident- Principles of assessment- Family pension- Whether family pension received by claimants be deducted from income of the deceased while computing compensation-Held-No. In Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Lalanwati and others, 2012 ACJ 2425 , it was observed that Fatal accident- PARAMJIT KAUR ETC VS PUNEET KUMAR ETC 12 Deceased aged 60, a retired teacher getting pension of Rs.9,000/- p.m, and drawing Rs.5,000/- p.m, working as Principal in a private school-Tribunal taking his pension of Rs.9,000 p/m., and adding Rs.5,000 salary from the private school, fixed income at Rs.14,000 p.m, deducted 1/3rd for personal expenses, assessed dependency at Rs.9,333 p.m., adopted multiplier of 7 and awarded Rs.7,83,972 plus Rs.20,000 for loss of consortium, loss to estate and funeral expenses: total Rs.8,03,972-Award upheld. In FAO No.2328 of 2015 (O&M) decided on 8.4.2015 in Reliance General Insurance Company Limited Vs. Davinder Kaur and others, it was observed that the first submission is not a legally sound argument as family pension to the widow has got nothing to do with compensation under the Motor Accident compensation law and is based on different Principle. 10 On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent no.1&2 has submitted that no such accident, as alleged, was ever taken place with the involvement of offending vehicle, thus, no negligence could be attributed to the respondent No.1, in this view of the matter, no liability can be fastened upon respondent No 1&2 to pay any compensation to the petitioners. He further argued that for the sake of discussion, if accident was taken place 'though not admitted, even then, Respondent no.1 was holding valid license EX.R2 at the day of alleged accident and respondent no.2 was owner as per RC EX.R4 of offending vehicle, which was also insured vide policy EX.R3 with respondent no.3, therefore, respondent no.3 is liable to indemnify the insured and prayed for dismissal the PARAMJIT KAUR ETC VS PUNEET KUMAR ETC 13 petition against them. 11 Learned counsel for respondent no.3 has submitted that there is only involved dispute with regard to quantum of compensation amount as respondent company did not raise rebut question of accident, as alleged, as Final investigating report has already submitted against respondent no.1 before trial court. He further argued that claimants are not dependent upon the income as claimant no.1 is getting pension and same shall be received by her till 2022. He further argued that claimants procured record of contract in connivance with private company who did not pay any amount of salary to deceased and age of deceased was 55 years instead of 50 at the time of death and claimants did not disclose the exact date of birth of deceased to claim excess compensation and prayed for dismissal the petition. 12 I have given due regard to the rival contentions put forth by learned counsel for respective parties and have evaluated entire oral evidence coupled with documentary evidence carefully. After thorough examination, it is observed that the petitioners-claimants have come to the Court with categorical stand that accident was taken place due to rash and negligent driving of Swift Car bearing registration No. PB-30-M-0435 by Respondent No.1, resulting death of Mohinder Singh on 15.04.2015. In order to prove factum of accident, PW4 {complainant-eye witness of accident} tendered affidavit Ex.PW4/A in evidence. He deposed that on 15.4.2015 Mohinder Singh was going from his village Tamnouli, Tehsil Barara, District Ambala, to Indian Oil Ambala Cantt, for performing his PARAMJIT KAUR ETC VS PUNEET KUMAR ETC 14 duty as per instructions of his employer, by driving his motorcycle bearing registration No. HR-01-U-2296 at a moderate speed on the correct left hand side on berm of Jagadhri to Ambala Cantt road. He was following on his Activa Scooter. At about 8.30 PM, when he reached within the area of Village Khudda Kalan, in the mean time, a Swift Car bearing Registration No. PB-30-M-0435, being driven by its driver i.e. Respondent No.1 so rashly, negligently and in zig zag manner and in an uncontrollable speed, came from opposite side i.e Ambala Cantt side. On seeing the said car coming in such rash and negligent manners, Mohinder Singh slow down the speed of his motorcycle and took the same on the extreme left hand side of the road on kacha berm, but respondent No.1 while leaving entire 30-35 feet wide mettled road without blowing any horn, without giving any indicators, after coming on the extreme wrong side on kacha berm of the road, hit against motorcycle of Mohinder Singh. As a result of that, Mohinder Singh fell on the road side along with his motorcycle and suffered multiple, simple and grievous injuries including head injury and motorcycle was extensively damaged. Many persons gathered at the spot. He rushed near injured and started taking care of Mohinder Singh. Respondent No.1 alighted from his car and came to see injured and on seeing his serious condition, respondent No.1 fled from the spot leaving behind offending car on the spot. PW4 gave telephonic message to family members of Mohinder Singh and took injured in an ambulance to Civil Hospital Ambala Cantt from the spot. Mohinder Singh was given first aid by the doctors of Civil Hospital, PARAMJIT KAUR ETC VS PUNEET KUMAR ETC 15 Ambala Cantt and referred to PGI Chandigarh, but Mohinder Singh died on the way to PGI Chandigarh, on account of injuries suffered by him. This accident took place due to sole rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1/ driver of Swift Car bearing Registration No. PB-30-M- 0435. He recorded his statement before police in civil hospital and then formal FIR No.111 dated 16.4.2015 under section 279, 304-A IPC was registered against the respondent No.1, who was arrested on 18.5.2015 and was identified by him. Respondent No.1 has been charge sheeted for causing this accident and is facing trial before JMIC Ambala. He categorically deposed that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1. Although, PW4 was cross examined, however, nothing can be elicited disbelieving factum of motor vehicular accident with offending vehicle. 13 It would be relevant to point out here that mere denial of rash and negligence after causing accident resulting death of male member, at the behest of respondents, are not found sufficient at all, rather, if there was no rash and negligent act at behest of driver, then driver/respondent no.1, could easily appear in the witness box to rebut the stand taken by claimants-petitioners. However, no reason has been assigned by the owner and insurance company for non-examination of the driver of vehicle. In accident cases, it is necessary to have the first hand report from the driver. It may be that the driver does not always speak the truth, but the driver's version is the one which is to be given the best consideration. He also knows that as to what actually happened and if the driver has not been PARAMJIT KAUR ETC VS PUNEET KUMAR ETC 16 examined, then an adverse inference must be drawn against him. To that effect, reliance can be placed on ruling Raju and others versus Sukhvinder Singh and others, 2006(4)RCR(civil) 82 (P&H) . It is quite well settled that the lodging of the first information report is not an essential prerequisite for claiming compensation arising from a motor accident. Each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The Tribunal is expected to adjudge a case on the basis of the evidence adduced without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled position of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. It must be remembered that in a motor accident claim, the claimants are not required to prove their case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. It is trite law that claimants-petitioners are required to prove its case, which sets up the particular case relating to the accident which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts upon the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way alleged by the claimants. The provisions with regard to claim under the Act are enacted keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimants are always entitled for compensation irrespective whether the police has registered the offence regarding the incident or not because no claim case can be left over on the mercy of the police. 14 The evidence proved on record irrefutably leads to the PARAMJIT KAUR ETC VS PUNEET KUMAR ETC 17 inference in terms of unrebutted evidence at the instance of petitioners that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1, resulting death of Mohinder Singh and respondent No.1 has been facing trial under section 279 and 304 A, therefore, in view of case law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993 (2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008 (2) R.C.R. (Civil) 774 , it can be safely held that the accident in question took place due to sole rash and negligent driving by respondent No.1. Accordingly, this issue no.1 is decided in favour of the claimants. ISSUE NO. 2: 15The onus to prove this issue is upon claimants. It is undisputed that deceased was married and died leaving behind his wife, two daughters and one son. The deceased was enjoying very good health and physique. Here, PW1 categorically stated that all claimants were fully dependent upon income of deceased, but due to untimely death of their only bread earner in the prime age of 50 years, they all have deprived from their source of income and also suffered mental shock and agony. PW1 also stated that they have spent Rs.50,000/- on transportation of dead body and funeral/ last rites of her deceased husband. Coming to question of age of deceased; it is evident that the age of deceased is less than 55 years at the date of death. PW1 categorically stated that t he date of birth of Mohinder Singh is 03.05.1960 as per record and his wife Smt. Paramjit Kaur is getting Rs.11524/- per month as pension till 2022. Lastly, Mohinder Singh was getting pension of Rs.5567/- per PARAMJIT KAUR ETC VS PUNEET KUMAR ETC 18 month along with Dearness allowance of 107%. However, claimants have wrongly shown age of deceased as 50 years, rather as per his date of birth, deceased was above 54 years at the day of death so it can be safely said that age of deceased was 54-55 years at the time of death and so multiplier of 11 is applicable as per law. 16 Coming to question of income of deceased; though, claimants- petitioners pleaded that deceased was earning Rs.30,000/- per month. However, claimants have entirely failed to prove monthly income of deceased 30000/- in any manner rather deceased was getting monthly pension of 11524/- at the time of his death and his widow sahll also receive the amount of pension till 2022 as evident on file. However, so far as private job is concerned; PW2 stated that it is correct that Mohinder Singh was on contract for the period of two years from 01.01.2014 to 31.12.2015. He further categorically stated that letter dated 23.08.2015 Ex.R1 bears signatures of Col. Jai Parkash Sharma and the amount salary from 01.01.2014 to 15.04.2015 has been paid to wife of deceased. Meaning thereby, PW2 did not pay even single penny to deceased during his life time and so it shall presume that PW2 has procured salary record of deceased after his death just to unnecessary support the victim to claim excess amount of compensation. Firstly, claimants have wrongly pleaded age of deceased as 50 years; secondly PW4 is the brother- in- law{Jija} of deceased; thirdly record of Private Job work has been secured and in the circumstances, income of deceased from private company can not be considered, rather such evidence has PARAMJIT KAUR ETC VS PUNEET KUMAR ETC 19 been collected just to get compensation on higher side by adopting one way or other. However, last income of deceased 11524/- per month{ In round figure 11500/-} can be accepted as evident on file. It may not be out of place to mention here that the monetary compensation will never be a sufficient succor for victims of accidental cases rather their needs can only be prevented by providing just compensation and it can not be cured. The best manner in which victims can be compensated for sufferings only to prevent recurrence of any such road incident by wrongdoer. In failure to protect or prevent the sufferings of victims due to death of their sole bread earner in road accident, it also imposes liability of state to take extra ordinary precaution to reduce such type of road accident by deputing sufficient trained traffic police or to comply with strict traffic rules to avoid such incident. It will certainly take lot of time for rehabilitation by the family members of deceased. 17 It would be appropriate to say that respondents failed to show any source of income of claimants except pension which is not deductible in eyes of law. He died on 15.4.2015 leaving behind widow, two unmarried daughters and one Son and therefore, they all are taken under his dependency. If four or five persons are dependent upon income of deceased, then 1/4th amount is deducted on account his living and personal expenses. Therefore, by considering the age of deceased between 54 to 55 years, multiplier of 11 is to be applied i n view of Smt. Sarla Verma and Ors. Vs Delhi Transport Corporation and another AIR 2009 PARAMJIT KAUR ETC VS PUNEET KUMAR ETC 20 Supreme Court 3104 . By applying multiplier of 11, the exact assessment of compensation would come to {103716x11} Rs. 11,40,876/- . Additionally, petitioners being children and widow have deprived from love and affection and also suffered pain and agony due to untimely death, therefore, they are entitled to Rs.50,000/- in these head. They have also spent amount on last rites/funeral of deceased and so they are entitled to funeral expenses amounting Rs.25,000/-. The petitioner no.1 being widow is also entitled to Rs.50000/- as consortium and in this manner, total compensation is computed to Rs.12,65,876/-- which shall be payable along with interest @ 7.5/- per annum from the date of filing the petition till its realization to the petitioners. Rests of relief sought by petitioners- claimants stands declined. Accordingly, issue no.2 is decided in favour of claimants-petitioners. ISSUE NO.3 to 5 : 18The onus to prove these issues are upon Respondents but they neither pressed these issue nor led any evidence. However, it has already discussed in detail under Issue No.1 & 2 that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. In this way, it has become obvious on file that this tribunal has left with no other option except to decide these issues against Respondents. Accordingly, both these issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.6 : 19 The onus to prove this issue is upon the respondent No.3, who is under the obligation to prove this fact that the respondent No.1 PARAMJIT KAUR ETC VS PUNEET KUMAR ETC 21 was not having a valid driving licence at the time of alleged accident and as such respondent no.2 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy/cover note EX.R3 and so respondent No.3 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimants. However, there is nothing on record to show that respondent No.1 was not holding any valid license, rather same is proved as EX.R2. Further, Insurance Policy Ex.R3 reveals that offending vehicle 'as per RC EX.R4, was insured with the respondent No.3 at the relevant time. There is nothing brought on record to show that the Driving licence Ex.R2 was invalid at the day of occurrence. In the fact and circumstances, it is quite clear that the respondent no.2 did not violate or breach any covenant and condition of the insurance policy. Accordingly, this Issue is decided against the respondent No.3. ISSUE NO.7 (RELIEF): PETITION SUCCEEDS ; 20 In view of the foregoing discussion, instant claim petition stands allowed with costs in a manner that the claimants-petitioners are held entitled to compensation of Rs.12,65,876/--- along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this claim petition till the date of actual payment. The awarded compensation amount along with interest shall be payable jointly and severally by respondent No.1 and respondent no.2 and respondent no.3, shall indemnify the insured. The 1/4 th each share of claimant-petitioner No.2 to4 shall be deposited in any nationalized bank in the shape of FDR and shall be payable to them at the time of their marriage. However, claimant-petitioner no.1 being mother shall be at liberty to receive accrued interest on their FDR either PARAMJIT KAUR ETC VS PUNEET KUMAR ETC 22 quarterly or half yearly for their education etc. The ¼th share of petitioner no.1 shall be deposited in FDR for two years in any nationalized bank and shall be payable to her. The additional compensation in the shape of consortium etc shall be payable to the account of claimant-petitioner No. 1 respectively. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.3000/-.

It is further averred that Manish Kumar (now deceased) was prominent, promising and healthy with excellent academic record, but due to his untimely death, claimants have suffered loss of love and affection, enjoyments and expectations of life. It is prayed that an Award of Rs.50,00,000/- alongwith interest from the date of accident till realization be passed in favour of petitioners. 13.On notice, respondents no.1 and 2 appeared and filed joint written statement in main claim petition titled Aman Sharma versus Rohit Kumar and others taking preliminary objections qua maintainability, suppression. It is further submitted that no alleged accident had occurred AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 30 and a false FIR has been got lodged in connivance with police. On merits, it is submitted that in fact, on the fateful day, respondent no.1 was driving his vehicle on correct side of the road with limited speed and when reached Rajpura T-Point, a tractor trolley suddenly took a turn from the T-Point and came on the road and on seeing the same, respondent no.1 applied brakes in order to save the tractor trolley, but his tipper turned turtle, which was lifted later by crane.

It is further submitted that if alleged accident is presumed to have occurred, even then answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation, since AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 31 claimant suffered alleged injuries only on account of rash and negligent driving of Bus in question. It is further submitted that even if cause of accident is proved, even then answering respondent is not liable to indemnify the owner of Tipper in question, since its driver was under influence of alcohol and was driving in violation of terms and conditions of alleged Insurance Policy. On merits, it is submitted that a false and manipulated FIR was got lodged in connivance with police. It is further submitted that liability, if any, is subject to various objections, as raised in written statement and as per terms and conditions of alleged Policy, if any. Denying all other averments, dismissal of the petition was prayed for. 15.On notice, respondent no.4 appeared and filed written statement taking preliminary objections qua locus standi.

On merits, it is submitted that in fact, accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving Tipper/Dumper in question rashly and negligently at fast speed and that answering respondent was driving the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 32 Bus in question at normal speed on correct side of the road.

On notice, respondent no.5 appeared and filed written statement qua maintainability, suppression. It is further submitted that respondent no.4 tried his level best to avoid the accident, but the same occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and that case has rightly been registered against respondent no.1. It is further submitted that there is no liability of answering respondent against alleged composite negligence. On merits, it is submitted that only respondents no.1 to 3 are liable to pay compensation. Denying all other averments, dismissal of petition was prayed for. 17.On notice, respondent no.6 appeared and filed written statement taking preliminary objections qua maintainability, cause of action, collusion, respondent no.4 not holding a valid and effective driving licence on the date of accident. It is further submitted that accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1, which is evident from the statement of Vikas Chaudhary, the author of FIR.

It is further submitted that petition has been filed after due consultation just to get compensation from answering respondent Denying all other averments, dismissal of petition was prayed for. 18.Though separate written statements were filed by respondents in each connected claim petition, yet same stand, as taken in main MACP no.208 of 2015 titled as Aman Sharma versus Rohit Kumar and others, has been taken. 19.Replication was not filed. From pleadings of parties, following issues were framed: 1.Whether the accident in question took place by rash and negligent driving of Tipper/Dumper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635 by respondent no.1 Rohit Kumar resulting into injuries to Aman Sharma, Ajay Kumar, Pritam Singh, Yogesh, Pawan, Vivek and Amit Saini and death of Deepak Sharma, Parminder Singh, Aamir Furqan and Manish Kumar, as alleged? OPP AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 34 2If Issue no.1 is proved, then whether the claimants are entitled to compensation, if so, how much and from whom? OPP 3Whether respondent no.1 was driving offending vehicle in violation of terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy, if so, its effect? OPR (3) 4Relief 20.Petitioners, in order to prove their case, examined as many as thirteen witnesses: PW1 Harpreet Kaur PW2 Manju PW3 Aliya Khatun PW4 Pritam Singh PW5 Amit Saini PW6 Aman Sharma PW7 Alka Sharma PW8 Ajay Kumar PW9 Yogesh PW10 Pawan Kumar PW11 Dr. Vikas Paul PW12 Vivek Sharma PW13 Amarjeet In documentary evidence, documents Ex.P37 to 178 were tendered. AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 35 21.On the other hand, respondents examined RW1 Rohit Kumar/respondent no.1. In documentary evidence, documents Ex.R1 to Ex.R11 were tendered. 22.No rebuttal evidence was led. 23.After due consideration of the arguments and evidence of both parties, the findings on the above issues along with reasons for the decision are given below:- ISSUE NO.1: 24.Burden to prove this issue was upon claimants. Ld. counsel for claimants submitted that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving vehicle no.HR37C/8635 in a rash and negligent manner. Ld. counsel relied upon the statements of PW4 to PW6, PW8 to PW10 and PW12 and copy of Challan Ex.P37 and copy of charge-sheet dated 30.07.2015 Ex.P38. and submitted that respondent no.1 was responsible for causing the accident as he was driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. 25.On the other hand, ld. counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 submitted that PW10 Pawan Kumar was driving Bus no.HR68A/2180 in a rash and negligent manner and he could have avoided the accident if he had control over his Bus as he dashed his bus against the Dumper/Tipper, which had turned turtle on the road. Ld. counsel further submitted that last control was in hands of PW10 and had he been driving his bus at moderate speed, the accident could have been avoided. 26.Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 Shri Mohinder Bindal AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 36 Advocate supported the arguments raised by ld. counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 and submitted that even if it is taken that respondent no.1 was not driving Dumper/Tipper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635 at moderate speed and so the Dumper turned turtle in middle of the road, even then the accident could have been avoided by PW10 Pawan Kumar by applying brakes, but he could not control his bus as he was driving in a rash and negligent manner and at high speed and his bus dashed against the Dumper/Tipper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635. Ld. counsel further submitted that all injured witnesses have wrongly deposed that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and these witnesses can not be believed as they have wrongly deposed the facts only in order to support the case of College authorities and to support PW10, so that College be not held liable to pay compensation. Ld. counsel further submitted that PW10 Pawan Kumar appeared as PW16 in criminal case titled as State versus Rohit and admitted that driver of the Tipper/Dumper had not received any injury in the accident and driver side of said Tipper was not damaged, so entire version of claimants and PW10 that it was head-on-collision between Bus and truck, is not believable. Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 further submitted that even if it is taken that respondent no.1 was also responsible for the accident, even then this case is of contributory negligence. 27. Ld. counsel for respondents no.4 to 6 supported the case of claimants and submitted that only respondent no.1 was responsible for the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 37 accident as he was driving vehicle no.HR37C/8653 in a rash and negligent manner. Ld. counsel further submitted that there is no evidence on record, from which it can be held that it is a case of contributory negligence and Pawan Kumar driver was also responsible for causing the accident. 28.I have given anxious consideration to the arguments raised by ld. counsel for the parties and have perused record of the case. 29.In this case, thirteen (13) witnesses have been examined on behalf of petitioners and respondent no.1 Rohit appeared as RW1. Statements of PW1 to PW3, PW7, PW11 and PW13 are not relevant for decision of Issue no.1. 30.This Tribunal is of the view that once drivers of both vehicles have appeared in the witness box i.e. Pawan Kumar/respondent no.4 as PW10 and Rohit Kumar/respondent no.1 as RW1, then statements of other injured witnesses are not so relevant as the drivers would be the best witnesses to make statement about manner, in which accident occurred. Otherwise also, there are vital contradictions om material points in statements of other eye-witness/injured witnesses i.e. PW4 to PW7, PW8, PW9 and PW12. 31.Pawan Kumar/respondent no.4 was driving College Bus bearing registration no.HR68A/2180 on the date of accident and he appeared as PW10. He filed affidavit Ex.PW10/A, wherein he deposed about the accident to the effect that on 31.3.2015, he alongwith students and staff was going from Ambala Cantt. to SDDI Global College and AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 38 SRM Institute of Technology at village Bhurewala, while driving College Bus no.HR68A/2180 at moderate speed on left side of the road and around 7.30/8.00 AM when reached in the area of village Rajpura on Saha Road, offending Dumper/Tipper no.HR37C/8635 being driven by respondent no.1 at very fast speed and in rash and negligent manner, came from opposite side and upon this he lowered down the speed of his Bus and came on extreme left side of the road, but said Dumper came on wrong side of the road and struck against the Bus, resultantly, all passengers in the Bus received multiple and grievous injuries. He further deposed that due to this accident, Aamir Furqan, Vipin wife of Sahil, Parminder Singh, Manish Kumar, Kesar Singh, Ankit Gupta and Deepak Sharma died at the spot. In his cross-examination, he admitted that driver side of Tipper struck against driver side of his Bus and sand/soil entered the Bus from front wind screen as both winds screens of the Bus had broken. So PW10 has admitted in his cross-examination that both wind screens of his Bus had broken and soil/sand came inside the bus. 32.Pawan Kumar (appeared as PW10 in this case), who was driving the Bus in question, appeared as PW16 in criminal case titled as 'State versus Rohit' pertaining to FIR no.41 dated 31.3.2014 registered for commission of offences punishable u/Ss.279, 337, 338, 304 IPC in Police Station Shahzadpur in regard to the accident in question and in his statement dated 16.2.2016 Ex.P41, he deposed that soil of the Tipper entered the Bus when Bus came in contact with the Tipper and stated that AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 39 it was a head-on-collision. He admitted that photographs attached with the file are the same photographs, which were taken after the accident. He further admitted that driver of the Tipper had not received any injury in said accident and driver side of the Tipper had not damaged in the accident. 33.The statement of RW1 is most relevant and he deposed that on 31.3.2015, he was driving Tipper no.HR37C/8635 on correct side of the road at moderate speed and when reached T-point Rajpura, a tractor trolley came on the road and took sudden turn from the T-point, on which he applied sudden brakes, due to which his Tipper turned sideways and when it was lying on the road, the College Bus no.HR68A/2180 came from opposite side rashly and negligently at high speed and dashed against the Tipper from back side, resultantly, the mud lying in the goods wagon of the Tipper entered the Bus from its windscreen and front windows, as a result thereof the mishap took place. 34.It is clear from statement of RW1 that he had not received any injury in said accident. In his cross-examination he deposed that driver of the Bus was driving his Bus in a rash and negligent manner at high speed and could not control his Bus on seeing the over-turned Tipper. He further deposed that said accident could have been avoided by bus driver, if he had controlled the same. It is admitted fact that respondent no.1 had not suffered any injury and it is not the case of claimants or respondent no.4 that any other occupant of the Tipper had suffered injuries in the accident. AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 40 35.PW5 Amit Saini filed his affidavit Ex.PW5/A and in his cross-examination deposed that driver side of the Bus struck against the conductor side of the truck and both drivers suffered injuries. However his statement is totally contradictory to statements of other witnesses and against record. It is matter of record that driver of Tipper had not suffered any injury. It is also very relevant to mention here that while appearing as PW11 in criminal case, PW Amit Saini deposed that there was T-point at the place of accident and Tipper was carrying mud. He further deposed that mud of the Tipper pumped in the Bus, when Bus came in contact with the Tipper and due to entering of mud, there occurred suffocation and many persons died. 36.PW12 Vivek Sharma deposed that accident occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Tipper driver and police had recorded his statement, wherein he had made same statement regarding cause of accident. But while appearing as PW15 in criminal case titled as State versus Rohit, Vivek Sharma deposed that he does not know as to how said accident occurred. He deposed that he had not made any statement to police. He denied the suggestion that said Tipper was being driven in a rash and negligent manner. He further denied the suggestion that said accident occurred due to negligence of accused. Considering above facts, this Tribunal is of the view that PW12 is not a reliable witness as he has changed his stand from one Court to other. 37.PW8 Ajay Kumar (in present case) appeared as PW10 in criminal case and deposed that he had not seen the driver of Tipper at the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 41 spot. He deposed that only left side of the Tipper was damaged. This Tribunal is of the view that he is not a reliable witness and can not be believed on the point of cause of accident, as being employee of the College, his interest is to avoid liability of the College. While appearing as PW8, he deposed that he was sitting on front seat i.e. conductor seat of the Bus. If he is believed, then version of respondent no.1 is also true that Bus dashed against the Tipper when same had already turned turtle on the road and so PW8 Ajay Kumar has rightly deposed before other Court that he had not seen driver of the Tipper at the spot. 38.It is matter of record that most of the other injured persons, who were travelling in the Bus on that day, while appearing as witnesses in the criminal case titled as State versus Rohit Kumar, admitted that there was curve near the place of occurrence and when driver of Tipper applied brakes, the Tipper turned turtle on the road and they deposed that can not identify driver of the Tipper. They admitted that Bus had entered the mud of the Tipper. 39.After considering the statement dated 16.2.2016 Ex.P41 of Pawan Kumar, this Tribunal is of the view that version of PW10 Pawan Kumar is not believable, as had it been a case of head-on-collision, the driver side of the Tipper would have damaged totally as impact of the accident was such that many persons travelling in the Bus died and other occupants of the Bus suffered grievous injuries. The case file of criminal case titled as “State versus Rohit” was also summoned at the time of arguments in this case and photographs of Tipper bearing registration AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 42 no.HR37C/8635 are on that judicial file, from which it is apparent that driver side of the Tipper even did not hit the Bus and so version of claimants specifically PW10 (driver of bus) regarding head-on-collision is totally false. The photographs on record of criminal case file speak otherwise and substantiate the arguments raised by ld. counsel for respondents no.1 to 3. 40.Sudden crossing of the road by a human being or a child; sudden presence of a stray animal on the road; bursting of tyre due to some alien sharp edge article lying on the road; sudden collapse of the bridge; fall of electric wires; tornado; storm; flush of rain water from cloud burst, etc. are a few illustrative circumstances in which driver of a vehicle can possibly lose control. In any such like sudden events, the drive would try to control the vehicle and may apply sudden brakes, which, instead of stopping the vehicle, may over turn it or cause slip thereby the vehicle might go out of the driver's control. Such kind of accident, happening of which is beyond the control of a driver, may be termed as an “act of God”. However, where the vehicle was in sound roadworthy condition and was driven with an ordinary care, it shall always be expected that it will not go out of control of the driver, yet if any such thing happens, heavy onus shall lie upon either the driver or the owner of the vehicle to divulge that special knowledge of the relevant facts to explain as to why and how the vehicle went out of control of the driver. In the absence of any such explanation, the maxim ' res ipsa loquitur' would undoubtedly be attracted, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 43 Court in Krishna Bus Service Ltd. vs. Smt. Mangli and others AIR 1976 SC 700. 41.The site plan prepared by police after the accident is on record as Ex.P40, from which it is clear that there was a curve near the place of accident and so the version of RW1 Rohit Kumar is believable that in order to avoid the accident with tractor, he had applied brakes and the tractor turned turtle. However, considering the fact that he was also driving at very high speed and that had he been driving at moderate speed, he could have controlled the vehicle. The principle of res ipsa loquitur applies to this case and it can be safely concluded that respondent no.4 was also responsible and had contributed in causing the accident. It is a clear cut case of contributory negligence. From photographs on record, it is apparent that the sand/soil entered the Bus up to about six feet from front of the Bus and it speaks about the speed, at which respondent no.1 was driving the Bus. 42.The claimants and their witnesses had tried their best to prove that it was head-on-collision and respondent no.1 was responsible for the accident. However after perusing entire record and statements of witnesses in criminal case titled as 'State versus Rohit', it is clear that there was a curve near the place of accident and somehow on applying brakes, the Tipper turned turtle on the road, which shows that respondent no.1 was driving the Tipper at high speed and had he been driving at moderate speed, he could have controlled his vehicle, but failed to do so. But on the other hand, it is also clear that respondent no.4 Pawan Kumar AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 44 was driving the Bus at such a high speed that mud loaded in the Tipper entered the Bus, as clear from admissions made by the witnesses and photographs clicked after the accident, which are on record of criminal case file. The quantity of sand/soil entered the Bus was so much that the occupants of the Bus felt suffocated and this suffocation was also the result of some deaths. Had respondent no.4 been driving the College Bus at moderate speed and in a careful manner, even if the Tipper had turned turtle in front of the Bus, the accident could have been avoided. So this can be safely concluded that respondent no.4 Pawan Kumar, driver of the Bus, was also responsible in causing of the accident and so accident was the result of negligence on the part of respondent no.1 (Rohit Kumar) and respondent no.4 (Pawan Kumar) and it is a case of contributory negligence. Both drivers were equally responsible for the accident. 43.After considering the entire evidence on record, it is held that claimed have successfully proved that Aman Sharma, Ajay Kumar, Pritam Singh, Yogesh, Pawan, Vivek and Amit Saini had suffered injuries in the accident in dispute and Deepak Sharma, Parminder Singh, Aamir Furqan and Manish Kumar died due to the injuries suffered in the accident in question. 44.After considering entire evidence on record and keeping in view the above discussion, it is held that accident was not the result of rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 only, but respondent no.4 had also contributed in causing of the accident and both drivers were equally responsible in causing the accident on that day. It is a case of AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 45 contributory negligence. Issue no.1 is decided accordingly. ISSUE NO.2: MACP No.208 of 2015 Aman Sharma vs. Rohit & others 45.In this petition, compensation has been claimed by claimant on account of injuries suffered by her. In the petition, claimant has claimed compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the accident. It has been pleaded that claimant suffered multiple, serious and grievous injuries including multiple fractures in right ankle and foot and that after the accident, she was shifted to Civil Hospital Ambala Cantt. She pleaded that she remained under treatment of private doctors and remained admitted as an indoor patient for many days and spent Rs.1,00,000/- on her treatment, transportation and special diet. 46.Claimant Aman Sharma appeared as PW6 and filed her affidavit Ex.PW6/A, wherein she reiterated the contents of petition regarding suffering of injuries, fractures suffered and shifting to Civil Hospital. She deposed that she spent Rs.1,00,000/- on treatment, medicines, instruments, transportation and special diet. She further deposed that she was 24 years of age and was employed as Lab Technician in Electronics and Communication Branch, S.D.D.I. Global College, village Bhurewala, District Ambala and was getting Rs.7,000/- per month. She further deposed that after said accident, she is not in a position to perform her daily routine and has become permanently disabled and is still under treatment. In cross examination, she deposed AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 46 that she has not brought any proof regarding injuries suffered by her, treatment, medical expenses and her income. 47.To substantiate her claim regarding her disability and injuries suffered in the accident, she has placed on record MLR Ex.P43 and Disability Certificate, issued by Medical Board of three doctors of General Hospital, Ambala City, as Ex.P44. From the MLR Ex.P43, it is clear that she suffered one injury i.e. on leg below knee joint. Due to fracture, she was operated upon and due to the injuries suffered, she suffered permanent disability. As per Disability Certificate Ex.P44, petitioner suffered disability to the extent of 5%. In view of the fact that she suffered permanent disability to the extent of 5%, Rs.10,000/- is awarded under the head of permanent disability. 48.Neither prescription slips nor any Bill showing purchase of medicines has been placed on record by the claimant to substantiate her claim regarding amount spent on treatment. Considering the nature of injuries suffered by petitioner and facts of the case, Rs.30,000/- is awarded in lump sum under the head of pain and suffering, special diet, transportation, attendant charges and loss of income. So, in total, Rs.40,000/- is awarded to claimant as compensation in this case. MACP No.209 of 2015 Manju vs. Rohit & others 49.This claim petition has been filed by petitioners claiming compensation on account of death of Deepak Sharma in the accident in question. Manju, mother of Deepak Sharma (now deceased) appeared as AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 47 PW2 and filed her affidavit Ex.PW2/A, wherein she deposed that her son Deepak Sharma was 27 years of age at the time of his death and was hale and hearty. She further deposed that he was employed as Lecturer of Mechanical Engineering in SRM College, village Bhurewala, District Ambala with management of Shree Ram Mulkh Institute of Engineering and Technology, village Bhurewala, District Ambala and was getting salary of Rs.25,000/- per month and was also taking tuition, thereby earning Rs.10,000/- per month. She further deposed that Rs.One lac was spent on transportation and last rites of deceased. She further deposed that the deceased being their only son, they suffered great loss of love and affection on account of his untimely death. 50.PW13 Amarjit appeared with record regarding employment and salary of deceased Deepak Sharma. He deposed that Deepak Sharma was working in Maha Prabhu Ram Mulkh HI-Tech Education Society as Lecturer at salary of Rs.21,600/- per month. He proved Salary Certificate Ex.P7, Appointment letter Ex.P8, Joining letter Ex.P9 and Attendance Register Ex.P10. In cross-examination, he deposed that as per Ex.P9, he joined as Lecturer Mechanical. 51.No evidence has been lead to probe income from any other source viz tuition etc. From the statement of PW13, it is clear that Deepak Sharma was not a regular employee and was only a Guest Lecturer against salary of Rs.21,600/- per month. Accordingly, his income is assessed as Rs.21,600/- per month. In this petition, claimants are parents of deceased. In this petition, claimants are parents of deceased Deepak Sharma. The AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 48 deceased was unmarried son of claimants and so half of monthly income assessed is to be deducted towards personal expenses of deceased. Accordingly, loss of dependency comes to Rs.10,800/- per month and Rs.1,29,600/- per annum. 52.In view of the law laid down in the case of Munna Lal Jain v. Vipin Kumar Sharma, 2015 AIR SCW 3105, age of the deceased is relevant for selection of multiplier, which is to be used while assessing compensation on account where parents are the claimants. On applying multiplier of '17', amount of compensation to be awarded under the head of loss of dependency comes to Rs.22,03,200/-. Rs.1,00,000/- each is awarded in favour of claimants under the head of loss of love and affection and Rs.25,000/- is awarded under the head of last rites. Accordingly, total compensation of Rs.24,28,200/- is awarded in favour of petitioners. The petitioners will get equal share out of the compensation awarded in this case.

It is further submitted that no alleged accident had occurred AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 30 and a false FIR has been got lodged in connivance with police. On merits, it is submitted that in fact, on the fateful day, respondent no.1 was driving his vehicle on correct side of the road with limited speed and when reached Rajpura T-Point, a tractor trolley suddenly took a turn from the T-Point and came on the road and on seeing the same, respondent no.1 applied brakes in order to save the tractor trolley, but his tipper turned turtle, which was lifted later by crane.

It is further submitted that even if cause of accident is proved, even then answering respondent is not liable to indemnify the owner of Tipper in question, since its driver was under influence of alcohol and was driving in violation of terms and conditions of alleged Insurance Policy.

It is further submitted that liability, if any, is subject to various objections, as raised in written statement and as per terms and conditions of alleged Policy, if any. Denying all other averments, dismissal of the petition was prayed for. 15.On notice, respondent no.4 appeared and filed written statement taking preliminary objections qua locus standi.

On merits, it is submitted that in fact, accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving Tipper/Dumper in question rashly and negligently at fast speed and that answering respondent was driving the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 32 Bus in question at normal speed on correct side of the road.

On notice, respondent no.5 appeared and filed written statement qua maintainability, suppression. It is further submitted that respondent no.4 tried his level best to avoid the accident, but the same occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and that case has rightly been registered against respondent no.1. It is further submitted that there is no liability of answering respondent against alleged composite negligence. On merits, it is submitted that only respondents no.1 to 3 are liable to pay compensation.

It is further submitted that petition has been filed after due consultation just to get compensation from answering respondent Denying all other averments, dismissal of petition was prayed for. 18.Though separate written statements were filed by respondents in each connected claim petition, yet same stand, as taken in main MACP no.208 of 2015 titled as Aman Sharma versus Rohit Kumar and others, has been taken. 19.Replication was not filed. From pleadings of parties, following issues were framed: 1.Whether the accident in question took place by rash and negligent driving of Tipper/Dumper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635 by respondent no.1 Rohit Kumar resulting into injuries to Aman Sharma, Ajay Kumar, Pritam Singh, Yogesh, Pawan, Vivek and Amit Saini and death of Deepak Sharma, Parminder Singh, Aamir Furqan and Manish Kumar, as alleged? OPP AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 34 2If Issue no.1 is proved, then whether the claimants are entitled to compensation, if so, how much and from whom? OPP 3Whether respondent no.1 was driving offending vehicle in violation of terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy, if so, its effect? OPR (3) 4Relief 20.Petitioners, in order to prove their case, examined as many as thirteen witnesses: PW1 Harpreet Kaur PW2 Manju PW3 Aliya Khatun PW4 Pritam Singh PW5 Amit Saini PW6 Aman Sharma PW7 Alka Sharma PW8 Ajay Kumar PW9 Yogesh PW10 Pawan Kumar PW11 Dr. Vikas Paul PW12 Vivek Sharma PW13 Amarjeet In documentary evidence, documents Ex.P37 to 178 were tendered. AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 35 21.On the other hand, respondents examined RW1 Rohit Kumar/respondent no.1. In documentary evidence, documents Ex.R1 to Ex.R11 were tendered. 22.No rebuttal evidence was led. 23.After due consideration of the arguments and evidence of both parties, the findings on the above issues along with reasons for the decision are given below:- ISSUE NO.1: 24.Burden to prove this issue was upon claimants. Ld. counsel for claimants submitted that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving vehicle no.HR37C/8635 in a rash and negligent manner. Ld. counsel relied upon the statements of PW4 to PW6, PW8 to PW10 and PW12 and copy of Challan Ex.P37 and copy of charge-sheet dated 30.07.2015 Ex.P38. and submitted that respondent no.1 was responsible for causing the accident as he was driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. 25.On the other hand, ld. counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 submitted that PW10 Pawan Kumar was driving Bus no.HR68A/2180 in a rash and negligent manner and he could have avoided the accident if he had control over his Bus as he dashed his bus against the Dumper/Tipper, which had turned turtle on the road. Ld. counsel further submitted that last control was in hands of PW10 and had he been driving his bus at moderate speed, the accident could have been avoided. 26.Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 Shri Mohinder Bindal AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 36 Advocate supported the arguments raised by ld. counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 and submitted that even if it is taken that respondent no.1 was not driving Dumper/Tipper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635 at moderate speed and so the Dumper turned turtle in middle of the road, even then the accident could have been avoided by PW10 Pawan Kumar by applying brakes, but he could not control his bus as he was driving in a rash and negligent manner and at high speed and his bus dashed against the Dumper/Tipper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635. Ld. counsel further submitted that all injured witnesses have wrongly deposed that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and these witnesses can not be believed as they have wrongly deposed the facts only in order to support the case of College authorities and to support PW10, so that College be not held liable to pay compensation. Ld. counsel further submitted that PW10 Pawan Kumar appeared as PW16 in criminal case titled as State versus Rohit and admitted that driver of the Tipper/Dumper had not received any injury in the accident and driver side of said Tipper was not damaged, so entire version of claimants and PW10 that it was head-on-collision between Bus and truck, is not believable. Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 further submitted that even if it is taken that respondent no.1 was also responsible for the accident, even then this case is of contributory negligence. 27. Ld. counsel for respondents no.4 to 6 supported the case of claimants and submitted that only respondent no.1 was responsible for the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 37 accident as he was driving vehicle no.HR37C/8653 in a rash and negligent manner. Ld. counsel further submitted that there is no evidence on record, from which it can be held that it is a case of contributory negligence and Pawan Kumar driver was also responsible for causing the accident. 28.I have given anxious consideration to the arguments raised by ld. counsel for the parties and have perused record of the case. 29.In this case, thirteen (13) witnesses have been examined on behalf of petitioners and respondent no.1 Rohit appeared as RW1. Statements of PW1 to PW3, PW7, PW11 and PW13 are not relevant for decision of Issue no.1. 30.This Tribunal is of the view that once drivers of both vehicles have appeared in the witness box i.e. Pawan Kumar/respondent no.4 as PW10 and Rohit Kumar/respondent no.1 as RW1, then statements of other injured witnesses are not so relevant as the drivers would be the best witnesses to make statement about manner, in which accident occurred. Otherwise also, there are vital contradictions om material points in statements of other eye-witness/injured witnesses i.e. PW4 to PW7, PW8, PW9 and PW12. 31.Pawan Kumar/respondent no.4 was driving College Bus bearing registration no.HR68A/2180 on the date of accident and he appeared as PW10. He filed affidavit Ex.PW10/A, wherein he deposed about the accident to the effect that on 31.3.2015, he alongwith students and staff was going from Ambala Cantt. to SDDI Global College and AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 38 SRM Institute of Technology at village Bhurewala, while driving College Bus no.HR68A/2180 at moderate speed on left side of the road and around 7.30/8.00 AM when reached in the area of village Rajpura on Saha Road, offending Dumper/Tipper no.HR37C/8635 being driven by respondent no.1 at very fast speed and in rash and negligent manner, came from opposite side and upon this he lowered down the speed of his Bus and came on extreme left side of the road, but said Dumper came on wrong side of the road and struck against the Bus, resultantly, all passengers in the Bus received multiple and grievous injuries. He further deposed that due to this accident, Aamir Furqan, Vipin wife of Sahil, Parminder Singh, Manish Kumar, Kesar Singh, Ankit Gupta and Deepak Sharma died at the spot. In his cross-examination, he admitted that driver side of Tipper struck against driver side of his Bus and sand/soil entered the Bus from front wind screen as both winds screens of the Bus had broken. So PW10 has admitted in his cross-examination that both wind screens of his Bus had broken and soil/sand came inside the bus. 32.Pawan Kumar (appeared as PW10 in this case), who was driving the Bus in question, appeared as PW16 in criminal case titled as 'State versus Rohit' pertaining to FIR no.41 dated 31.3.2014 registered for commission of offences punishable u/Ss.279, 337, 338, 304 IPC in Police Station Shahzadpur in regard to the accident in question and in his statement dated 16.2.2016 Ex.P41, he deposed that soil of the Tipper entered the Bus when Bus came in contact with the Tipper and stated that AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 39 it was a head-on-collision. He admitted that photographs attached with the file are the same photographs, which were taken after the accident. He further admitted that driver of the Tipper had not received any injury in said accident and driver side of the Tipper had not damaged in the accident. 33.The statement of RW1 is most relevant and he deposed that on 31.3.2015, he was driving Tipper no.HR37C/8635 on correct side of the road at moderate speed and when reached T-point Rajpura, a tractor trolley came on the road and took sudden turn from the T-point, on which he applied sudden brakes, due to which his Tipper turned sideways and when it was lying on the road, the College Bus no.HR68A/2180 came from opposite side rashly and negligently at high speed and dashed against the Tipper from back side, resultantly, the mud lying in the goods wagon of the Tipper entered the Bus from its windscreen and front windows, as a result thereof the mishap took place. 34.It is clear from statement of RW1 that he had not received any injury in said accident. In his cross-examination he deposed that driver of the Bus was driving his Bus in a rash and negligent manner at high speed and could not control his Bus on seeing the over-turned Tipper. He further deposed that said accident could have been avoided by bus driver, if he had controlled the same. It is admitted fact that respondent no.1 had not suffered any injury and it is not the case of claimants or respondent no.4 that any other occupant of the Tipper had suffered injuries in the accident. AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 40 35.PW5 Amit Saini filed his affidavit Ex.PW5/A and in his cross-examination deposed that driver side of the Bus struck against the conductor side of the truck and both drivers suffered injuries. However his statement is totally contradictory to statements of other witnesses and against record. It is matter of record that driver of Tipper had not suffered any injury. It is also very relevant to mention here that while appearing as PW11 in criminal case, PW Amit Saini deposed that there was T-point at the place of accident and Tipper was carrying mud. He further deposed that mud of the Tipper pumped in the Bus, when Bus came in contact with the Tipper and due to entering of mud, there occurred suffocation and many persons died. 36.PW12 Vivek Sharma deposed that accident occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Tipper driver and police had recorded his statement, wherein he had made same statement regarding cause of accident. But while appearing as PW15 in criminal case titled as State versus Rohit, Vivek Sharma deposed that he does not know as to how said accident occurred. He deposed that he had not made any statement to police. He denied the suggestion that said Tipper was being driven in a rash and negligent manner. He further denied the suggestion that said accident occurred due to negligence of accused. Considering above facts, this Tribunal is of the view that PW12 is not a reliable witness as he has changed his stand from one Court to other. 37.PW8 Ajay Kumar (in present case) appeared as PW10 in criminal case and deposed that he had not seen the driver of Tipper at the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 41 spot. He deposed that only left side of the Tipper was damaged. This Tribunal is of the view that he is not a reliable witness and can not be believed on the point of cause of accident, as being employee of the College, his interest is to avoid liability of the College. While appearing as PW8, he deposed that he was sitting on front seat i.e. conductor seat of the Bus. If he is believed, then version of respondent no.1 is also true that Bus dashed against the Tipper when same had already turned turtle on the road and so PW8 Ajay Kumar has rightly deposed before other Court that he had not seen driver of the Tipper at the spot. 38.It is matter of record that most of the other injured persons, who were travelling in the Bus on that day, while appearing as witnesses in the criminal case titled as State versus Rohit Kumar, admitted that there was curve near the place of occurrence and when driver of Tipper applied brakes, the Tipper turned turtle on the road and they deposed that can not identify driver of the Tipper. They admitted that Bus had entered the mud of the Tipper. 39.After considering the statement dated 16.2.2016 Ex.P41 of Pawan Kumar, this Tribunal is of the view that version of PW10 Pawan Kumar is not believable, as had it been a case of head-on-collision, the driver side of the Tipper would have damaged totally as impact of the accident was such that many persons travelling in the Bus died and other occupants of the Bus suffered grievous injuries. The case file of criminal case titled as “State versus Rohit” was also summoned at the time of arguments in this case and photographs of Tipper bearing registration AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 42 no.HR37C/8635 are on that judicial file, from which it is apparent that driver side of the Tipper even did not hit the Bus and so version of claimants specifically PW10 (driver of bus) regarding head-on-collision is totally false. The photographs on record of criminal case file speak otherwise and substantiate the arguments raised by ld. counsel for respondents no.1 to 3. 40.Sudden crossing of the road by a human being or a child; sudden presence of a stray animal on the road; bursting of tyre due to some alien sharp edge article lying on the road; sudden collapse of the bridge; fall of electric wires; tornado; storm; flush of rain water from cloud burst, etc. are a few illustrative circumstances in which driver of a vehicle can possibly lose control. In any such like sudden events, the drive would try to control the vehicle and may apply sudden brakes, which, instead of stopping the vehicle, may over turn it or cause slip thereby the vehicle might go out of the driver's control. Such kind of accident, happening of which is beyond the control of a driver, may be termed as an “act of God”. However, where the vehicle was in sound roadworthy condition and was driven with an ordinary care, it shall always be expected that it will not go out of control of the driver, yet if any such thing happens, heavy onus shall lie upon either the driver or the owner of the vehicle to divulge that special knowledge of the relevant facts to explain as to why and how the vehicle went out of control of the driver. In the absence of any such explanation, the maxim ' res ipsa loquitur' would undoubtedly be attracted, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 43 Court in Krishna Bus Service Ltd. vs. Smt. Mangli and others AIR 1976 SC 700. 41.The site plan prepared by police after the accident is on record as Ex.P40, from which it is clear that there was a curve near the place of accident and so the version of RW1 Rohit Kumar is believable that in order to avoid the accident with tractor, he had applied brakes and the tractor turned turtle. However, considering the fact that he was also driving at very high speed and that had he been driving at moderate speed, he could have controlled the vehicle. The principle of res ipsa loquitur applies to this case and it can be safely concluded that respondent no.4 was also responsible and had contributed in causing the accident. It is a clear cut case of contributory negligence. From photographs on record, it is apparent that the sand/soil entered the Bus up to about six feet from front of the Bus and it speaks about the speed, at which respondent no.1 was driving the Bus. 42.The claimants and their witnesses had tried their best to prove that it was head-on-collision and respondent no.1 was responsible for the accident. However after perusing entire record and statements of witnesses in criminal case titled as 'State versus Rohit', it is clear that there was a curve near the place of accident and somehow on applying brakes, the Tipper turned turtle on the road, which shows that respondent no.1 was driving the Tipper at high speed and had he been driving at moderate speed, he could have controlled his vehicle, but failed to do so. But on the other hand, it is also clear that respondent no.4 Pawan Kumar AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 44 was driving the Bus at such a high speed that mud loaded in the Tipper entered the Bus, as clear from admissions made by the witnesses and photographs clicked after the accident, which are on record of criminal case file. The quantity of sand/soil entered the Bus was so much that the occupants of the Bus felt suffocated and this suffocation was also the result of some deaths. Had respondent no.4 been driving the College Bus at moderate speed and in a careful manner, even if the Tipper had turned turtle in front of the Bus, the accident could have been avoided. So this can be safely concluded that respondent no.4 Pawan Kumar, driver of the Bus, was also responsible in causing of the accident and so accident was the result of negligence on the part of respondent no.1 (Rohit Kumar) and respondent no.4 (Pawan Kumar) and it is a case of contributory negligence. Both drivers were equally responsible for the accident. 43.After considering the entire evidence on record, it is held that claimed have successfully proved that Aman Sharma, Ajay Kumar, Pritam Singh, Yogesh, Pawan, Vivek and Amit Saini had suffered injuries in the accident in dispute and Deepak Sharma, Parminder Singh, Aamir Furqan and Manish Kumar died due to the injuries suffered in the accident in question. 44.After considering entire evidence on record and keeping in view the above discussion, it is held that accident was not the result of rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 only, but respondent no.4 had also contributed in causing of the accident and both drivers were equally responsible in causing the accident on that day. It is a case of AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 45 contributory negligence. Issue no.1 is decided accordingly. ISSUE NO.2: MACP No.208 of 2015 Aman Sharma vs. Rohit & others 45.In this petition, compensation has been claimed by claimant on account of injuries suffered by her. In the petition, claimant has claimed compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the accident. It has been pleaded that claimant suffered multiple, serious and grievous injuries including multiple fractures in right ankle and foot and that after the accident, she was shifted to Civil Hospital Ambala Cantt. She pleaded that she remained under treatment of private doctors and remained admitted as an indoor patient for many days and spent Rs.1,00,000/- on her treatment, transportation and special diet. 46.Claimant Aman Sharma appeared as PW6 and filed her affidavit Ex.PW6/A, wherein she reiterated the contents of petition regarding suffering of injuries, fractures suffered and shifting to Civil Hospital. She deposed that she spent Rs.1,00,000/- on treatment, medicines, instruments, transportation and special diet. She further deposed that she was 24 years of age and was employed as Lab Technician in Electronics and Communication Branch, S.D.D.I. Global College, village Bhurewala, District Ambala and was getting Rs.7,000/- per month. She further deposed that after said accident, she is not in a position to perform her daily routine and has become permanently disabled and is still under treatment. In cross examination, she deposed AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 46 that she has not brought any proof regarding injuries suffered by her, treatment, medical expenses and her income. 47.To substantiate her claim regarding her disability and injuries suffered in the accident, she has placed on record MLR Ex.P43 and Disability Certificate, issued by Medical Board of three doctors of General Hospital, Ambala City, as Ex.P44. From the MLR Ex.P43, it is clear that she suffered one injury i.e. on leg below knee joint. Due to fracture, she was operated upon and due to the injuries suffered, she suffered permanent disability. As per Disability Certificate Ex.P44, petitioner suffered disability to the extent of 5%. In view of the fact that she suffered permanent disability to the extent of 5%, Rs.10,000/- is awarded under the head of permanent disability. 48.Neither prescription slips nor any Bill showing purchase of medicines has been placed on record by the claimant to substantiate her claim regarding amount spent on treatment. Considering the nature of injuries suffered by petitioner and facts of the case, Rs.30,000/- is awarded in lump sum under the head of pain and suffering, special diet, transportation, attendant charges and loss of income. So, in total, Rs.40,000/- is awarded to claimant as compensation in this case. MACP No.209 of 2015 Manju vs. Rohit & others 49.This claim petition has been filed by petitioners claiming compensation on account of death of Deepak Sharma in the accident in question. Manju, mother of Deepak Sharma (now deceased) appeared as AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 47 PW2 and filed her affidavit Ex.PW2/A, wherein she deposed that her son Deepak Sharma was 27 years of age at the time of his death and was hale and hearty. She further deposed that he was employed as Lecturer of Mechanical Engineering in SRM College, village Bhurewala, District Ambala with management of Shree Ram Mulkh Institute of Engineering and Technology, village Bhurewala, District Ambala and was getting salary of Rs.25,000/- per month and was also taking tuition, thereby earning Rs.10,000/- per month. She further deposed that Rs.One lac was spent on transportation and last rites of deceased. She further deposed that the deceased being their only son, they suffered great loss of love and affection on account of his untimely death. 50.PW13 Amarjit appeared with record regarding employment and salary of deceased Deepak Sharma. He deposed that Deepak Sharma was working in Maha Prabhu Ram Mulkh HI-Tech Education Society as Lecturer at salary of Rs.21,600/- per month. He proved Salary Certificate Ex.P7, Appointment letter Ex.P8, Joining letter Ex.P9 and Attendance Register Ex.P10. In cross-examination, he deposed that as per Ex.P9, he joined as Lecturer Mechanical. 51.No evidence has been lead to probe income from any other source viz tuition etc. From the statement of PW13, it is clear that Deepak Sharma was not a regular employee and was only a Guest Lecturer against salary of Rs.21,600/- per month. Accordingly, his income is assessed as Rs.21,600/- per month. In this petition, claimants are parents of deceased. In this petition, claimants are parents of deceased Deepak Sharma. The AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 48 deceased was unmarried son of claimants and so half of monthly income assessed is to be deducted towards personal expenses of deceased. Accordingly, loss of dependency comes to Rs.10,800/- per month and Rs.1,29,600/- per annum. 52.In view of the law laid down in the case of Munna Lal Jain v. Vipin Kumar Sharma, 2015 AIR SCW 3105, age of the deceased is relevant for selection of multiplier, which is to be used while assessing compensation on account where parents are the claimants. On applying multiplier of '17', amount of compensation to be awarded under the head of loss of dependency comes to Rs.22,03,200/-. Rs.1,00,000/- each is awarded in favour of claimants under the head of loss of love and affection and Rs.25,000/- is awarded under the head of last rites. Accordingly, total compensation of Rs.24,28,200/- is awarded in favour of petitioners. The petitioners will get equal share out of the compensation awarded in this case.

Sintu @ Lahori etc. 5 tralla resulting in serious injuries to him and he was shifted to the hospital where he was declared brought dead. The FIR was got registered on the statement of Lakhi on the next day and the same is Ex.P-2 and the respondent no.1 was facing trial for the said accident as per report under section 173 Cr.P.C., Ex.P-3 and this has also been deposed in the witness box by the scribe of the FIR Lakhi as PW-2. No rebuttal to this has come on the part of the respondents. 11)Learned counsel for the respondent no.3 meanwhile argued that the presence of the complainant at the spot is highly doubtful and no such accident ever took place and a false claim petition has been filed by the petitioners. 12)I have heard the counsels for the parties and perused the file carefully. 13)FIR, Ex.P-2 mentions the manner in which the accident was caused and it also mentions the number of offending truck tralla which was parked in the middle of the road and respondent no.1 was facing trial for the said accident as per report under section 173 Cr.P.C. brought on file. No rebuttal to this has come on the part of the respondents. Even otherwise, it is observed by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Smt. Surinder Kaur and others Versus Lakhbir Singh and another 2007(1) PLR 494 that; “F.I.R.-Being a public document is admissible in evidence as such and if no objection is raised at the time of production thereof, the same is Jagjit Singh, MACT Babita Rani etc. Vs. Sintu @ Lahori etc. 6 to be read in evidence.” Similar view was held by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Bansi Yadav and another Versus Krishan Kumar and another 2004(3) ACC 758. Keeping in view the principle laid down in authorities (Supra), it becomes clear that the FIR being a public document and when not rebutted is to be considered as true. It is also important to note that the proceedings in MACT cases are of summary nature and the case is not to be proved like civil case where case is to be proved from the point of preponderance of probabilities or in criminal case, where charge is to be proved beyond shadows of doubt. The FIR has been registered against the respondent no.1. So, in view of law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993(2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008(2) R.C.R. (civil) 774, it can be safely held that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle truck tralla bearing registration No.PB-23F-5128 by respondent no.1. Accordingly, issue no.1 is decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUES No.2 AND 3:- 14)The onus of proving issue no.2 was on the petitioners while onus of proving issue no.3 was upon the respondents. Finding of one issue shall have bearing on the other and hence the same are being decided together. To prove the above issues, learned counsel for the petitioners Jagjit Singh, MACT Babita Rani etc. Vs. Sintu @ Lahori etc. 7 argued that the deceased was 39 years old at the time of his death and worked in the Press and also as an agriculturist and had a substantial monthly income. He has left behind five dependents which include his widow, three children and his father and they were entitled to the compensation accordingly. 15)Learned counsel for respondent no.3 meanwhile argued that compensation being sought is on the higher side as no proof of income of the deceased has come on record. The deceased contributed towards the accident as he could clearly see the truck-tralla parked and was required to take care while driving. Moreover, PW-1 and PW-3 have stated different timings of working of the deceased at the alleged Press and this contention cannot be believed. PW-3, who is said to have been employed the deceased stated that his profit was about Rs.8000/- per month and he was paying Rs.7000/- to the deceased which was not possible and he stated to have employed two employees with him. It was further argued that the father of the deceased cannot be said to be dependent upon him and the petitioners were thus not entitled to the compensation as prayed for. Learned counsel for the respondent placed reliance upon the principles laid down in Pepsu Road Transport Corporation, Patiala Vs. Gurdial Singh & Ors., 1990(2) ACC 356 , where it was held that “ As is well know the scooter too has a head-light and even if the bus was parked on the road, it should have been visible to the deceased by the Jagjit Singh, MACT Babita Rani etc. Vs. Sintu @ Lahori etc. 8 light of the scooters head-light and he could thereafter have applied the brakes or at any rate, tried to avoid it by going around it. There is no hint even in the testimony of Gurdeep Singh that the deceased did anything in this direction. ” Similar view was held in Gurdial Singh & Ors. Vs. Pepsu Road Transport Corporation & Anr., 2000 ACJ 271 . 16)I have heard the learned counsels for the parties and have perused the case file carefully. 17)The deceased in the present case as per his Post Mortem Report was about 40 years old at the time of his death and has left behind four dependents since his father – petitioner no.5 cannot be considered as dependent upon the deceased without specific evidence in this regard. It is alleged that the deceased worked in the Press and was an agriculturist but the evidence brought on record could not be considered since PW-3 cannot be said to be paying his entire profit as salary to his two employees. At the most the deceased can be said to be working as labourer in the year 2015 and earning monthly income of Rs.7500/- per month. Considering this as his monthly income, the petitioners become entitled to following amount of compensation. Monthly income Rs.7500/-. Annual earning comes to Rs.90,000/-. Having left behind four dependents 1/4th of this amount is to be deducted towards the personal living and expenses of the deceased, which comes to Rs.22,500/- and balance comes to Rs.67,500/-. The Jagjit Singh, MACT Babita Rani etc. Vs. Sintu @ Lahori etc. 9 deceased being 40 years old at the time of his death, the multiplier of '15' would apply in the present case and by applying the same, the amount comes to Rs.10,12,000/-. Besides this, the petitioners are also entitled to a sum of Rs.25,000/- for performing last rites of the deceased. Apart from this the petitioners would also be entitled to a separate amount of Rs.50,000/- each for loss of consortium to petitioner no.1 and loss of love and affection for petitioners no.2 to 4. The petitioners are also entitled to interest @ 7.5.% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization. 18)With regard to the contention of learned counsel for respondent no.3 about the deceased himself having contributed to the accident, the respondent no.3 failed to lead any evidence in this regard and merely because the deceased was unable to see the parked vehicle it cannot be said that he contributed towards the accident since it is specifically stated in the evidence about the difficulty in seeing the parked vehicle in the middle of the road due to the lights of incoming vehicles. 19)With regard to the respondents liable to pay the amount of compensation, the offending vehicle was properly insured with the respondent no.3 and respondent no.3 failed to show any violation of the terms and conditions of the policy by the respondents no.1 and 2 and therefore, all the respondents would be jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation. In view of above discussion, issue no.2 is decided in favour of the petitioners, while issue no.3 is decided against Jagjit Singh, MACT Babita Rani etc. Vs. Sintu @ Lahori etc. 10 the respondents. ISSUE NO. 4 (RELIEF):- 20)Keeping in view of my detailed discussion on all the aforesaid issues, the petition is allowed with costs. Out of the total amount of Rs.10,37,000/-, the petitioners no.2, 3 and 4 would be entitled to a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- each and the petitioner no.1 would be entitled to the remaining amount, apart from Rs.50,000/- each for loss of love and affection of petitioners no.2 to 4 and loss of consortium of petitioner no.1. The petitioners are also entitled for the interest of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization. Amount of compensation be disbursed in favour of petitioner No.1 in cash against proper receipt and identification, while the amount of petitioners No.2 to 4 be deposited in some nationalized bank till attaining the age of majority by them. The bank will not advance any loan or create any charge against the FDR without the prior permission of the Tribunal. The respondents no.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly and file be consigned to record room after due compliance.

It is further submitted that if it is concluded that accident occurred due to composite/contributory rash and negligent driving of respondent no.4, then respondent no.6 is liable to pay the compensation. On merits, it is submitted that in fact, accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving Tipper/Dumper in question rashly and negligently at fast speed and that answering respondent was driving the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 32 Bus in question at normal speed on correct side of the road.

From pleadings of parties, following issues were framed: 1.Whether the accident in question took place by rash and negligent driving of Tipper/Dumper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635 by respondent no.1 Rohit Kumar resulting into injuries to Aman Sharma, Ajay Kumar, Pritam Singh, Yogesh, Pawan, Vivek and Amit Saini and death of Deepak Sharma, Parminder Singh, Aamir Furqan and Manish Kumar, as alleged? OPP AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 34 2If Issue no.1 is proved, then whether the claimants are entitled to compensation, if so, how much and from whom? OPP 3Whether respondent no.1 was driving offending vehicle in violation of terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy, if so, its effect? OPR (3) 4Relief 20.Petitioners, in order to prove their case, examined as many as thirteen witnesses: PW1 Harpreet Kaur PW2 Manju PW3 Aliya Khatun PW4 Pritam Singh PW5 Amit Saini PW6 Aman Sharma PW7 Alka Sharma PW8 Ajay Kumar PW9 Yogesh PW10 Pawan Kumar PW11 Dr. Vikas Paul PW12 Vivek Sharma PW13 Amarjeet In documentary evidence, documents Ex.P37 to 178 were tendered. AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 35 21.On the other hand, respondents examined RW1 Rohit Kumar/respondent no.1. In documentary evidence, documents Ex.R1 to Ex.R11 were tendered. 22.No rebuttal evidence was led. 23.After due consideration of the arguments and evidence of both parties, the findings on the above issues along with reasons for the decision are given below:- ISSUE NO.1: 24.Burden to prove this issue was upon claimants. Ld. counsel for claimants submitted that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving vehicle no.HR37C/8635 in a rash and negligent manner. Ld. counsel relied upon the statements of PW4 to PW6, PW8 to PW10 and PW12 and copy of Challan Ex.P37 and copy of charge-sheet dated 30.07.2015 Ex.P38. and submitted that respondent no.1 was responsible for causing the accident as he was driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. 25.On the other hand, ld. counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 submitted that PW10 Pawan Kumar was driving Bus no.HR68A/2180 in a rash and negligent manner and he could have avoided the accident if he had control over his Bus as he dashed his bus against the Dumper/Tipper, which had turned turtle on the road. Ld. counsel further submitted that last control was in hands of PW10 and had he been driving his bus at moderate speed, the accident could have been avoided. 26.Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 Shri Mohinder Bindal AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 36 Advocate supported the arguments raised by ld. counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 and submitted that even if it is taken that respondent no.1 was not driving Dumper/Tipper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635 at moderate speed and so the Dumper turned turtle in middle of the road, even then the accident could have been avoided by PW10 Pawan Kumar by applying brakes, but he could not control his bus as he was driving in a rash and negligent manner and at high speed and his bus dashed against the Dumper/Tipper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635. Ld. counsel further submitted that all injured witnesses have wrongly deposed that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and these witnesses can not be believed as they have wrongly deposed the facts only in order to support the case of College authorities and to support PW10, so that College be not held liable to pay compensation. Ld. counsel further submitted that PW10 Pawan Kumar appeared as PW16 in criminal case titled as State versus Rohit and admitted that driver of the Tipper/Dumper had not received any injury in the accident and driver side of said Tipper was not damaged, so entire version of claimants and PW10 that it was head-on-collision between Bus and truck, is not believable. Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 further submitted that even if it is taken that respondent no.1 was also responsible for the accident, even then this case is of contributory negligence. 27. Ld. counsel for respondents no.4 to 6 supported the case of claimants and submitted that only respondent no.1 was responsible for the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 37 accident as he was driving vehicle no.HR37C/8653 in a rash and negligent manner. Ld. counsel further submitted that there is no evidence on record, from which it can be held that it is a case of contributory negligence and Pawan Kumar driver was also responsible for causing the accident. 28.I have given anxious consideration to the arguments raised by ld. counsel for the parties and have perused record of the case. 29.In this case, thirteen (13) witnesses have been examined on behalf of petitioners and respondent no.1 Rohit appeared as RW1. Statements of PW1 to PW3, PW7, PW11 and PW13 are not relevant for decision of Issue no.1. 30.This Tribunal is of the view that once drivers of both vehicles have appeared in the witness box i.e. Pawan Kumar/respondent no.4 as PW10 and Rohit Kumar/respondent no.1 as RW1, then statements of other injured witnesses are not so relevant as the drivers would be the best witnesses to make statement about manner, in which accident occurred. Otherwise also, there are vital contradictions om material points in statements of other eye-witness/injured witnesses i.e. PW4 to PW7, PW8, PW9 and PW12. 31.Pawan Kumar/respondent no.4 was driving College Bus bearing registration no.HR68A/2180 on the date of accident and he appeared as PW10. He filed affidavit Ex.PW10/A, wherein he deposed about the accident to the effect that on 31.3.2015, he alongwith students and staff was going from Ambala Cantt. to SDDI Global College and AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 38 SRM Institute of Technology at village Bhurewala, while driving College Bus no.HR68A/2180 at moderate speed on left side of the road and around 7.30/8.00 AM when reached in the area of village Rajpura on Saha Road, offending Dumper/Tipper no.HR37C/8635 being driven by respondent no.1 at very fast speed and in rash and negligent manner, came from opposite side and upon this he lowered down the speed of his Bus and came on extreme left side of the road, but said Dumper came on wrong side of the road and struck against the Bus, resultantly, all passengers in the Bus received multiple and grievous injuries. He further deposed that due to this accident, Aamir Furqan, Vipin wife of Sahil, Parminder Singh, Manish Kumar, Kesar Singh, Ankit Gupta and Deepak Sharma died at the spot. In his cross-examination, he admitted that driver side of Tipper struck against driver side of his Bus and sand/soil entered the Bus from front wind screen as both winds screens of the Bus had broken. So PW10 has admitted in his cross-examination that both wind screens of his Bus had broken and soil/sand came inside the bus. 32.Pawan Kumar (appeared as PW10 in this case), who was driving the Bus in question, appeared as PW16 in criminal case titled as 'State versus Rohit' pertaining to FIR no.41 dated 31.3.2014 registered for commission of offences punishable u/Ss.279, 337, 338, 304 IPC in Police Station Shahzadpur in regard to the accident in question and in his statement dated 16.2.2016 Ex.P41, he deposed that soil of the Tipper entered the Bus when Bus came in contact with the Tipper and stated that AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 39 it was a head-on-collision. He admitted that photographs attached with the file are the same photographs, which were taken after the accident. He further admitted that driver of the Tipper had not received any injury in said accident and driver side of the Tipper had not damaged in the accident. 33.The statement of RW1 is most relevant and he deposed that on 31.3.2015, he was driving Tipper no.HR37C/8635 on correct side of the road at moderate speed and when reached T-point Rajpura, a tractor trolley came on the road and took sudden turn from the T-point, on which he applied sudden brakes, due to which his Tipper turned sideways and when it was lying on the road, the College Bus no.HR68A/2180 came from opposite side rashly and negligently at high speed and dashed against the Tipper from back side, resultantly, the mud lying in the goods wagon of the Tipper entered the Bus from its windscreen and front windows, as a result thereof the mishap took place. 34.It is clear from statement of RW1 that he had not received any injury in said accident. In his cross-examination he deposed that driver of the Bus was driving his Bus in a rash and negligent manner at high speed and could not control his Bus on seeing the over-turned Tipper. He further deposed that said accident could have been avoided by bus driver, if he had controlled the same. It is admitted fact that respondent no.1 had not suffered any injury and it is not the case of claimants or respondent no.4 that any other occupant of the Tipper had suffered injuries in the accident. AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 40 35.PW5 Amit Saini filed his affidavit Ex.PW5/A and in his cross-examination deposed that driver side of the Bus struck against the conductor side of the truck and both drivers suffered injuries. However his statement is totally contradictory to statements of other witnesses and against record. It is matter of record that driver of Tipper had not suffered any injury. It is also very relevant to mention here that while appearing as PW11 in criminal case, PW Amit Saini deposed that there was T-point at the place of accident and Tipper was carrying mud. He further deposed that mud of the Tipper pumped in the Bus, when Bus came in contact with the Tipper and due to entering of mud, there occurred suffocation and many persons died. 36.PW12 Vivek Sharma deposed that accident occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Tipper driver and police had recorded his statement, wherein he had made same statement regarding cause of accident. But while appearing as PW15 in criminal case titled as State versus Rohit, Vivek Sharma deposed that he does not know as to how said accident occurred. He deposed that he had not made any statement to police. He denied the suggestion that said Tipper was being driven in a rash and negligent manner. He further denied the suggestion that said accident occurred due to negligence of accused. Considering above facts, this Tribunal is of the view that PW12 is not a reliable witness as he has changed his stand from one Court to other. 37.PW8 Ajay Kumar (in present case) appeared as PW10 in criminal case and deposed that he had not seen the driver of Tipper at the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 41 spot. He deposed that only left side of the Tipper was damaged. This Tribunal is of the view that he is not a reliable witness and can not be believed on the point of cause of accident, as being employee of the College, his interest is to avoid liability of the College. While appearing as PW8, he deposed that he was sitting on front seat i.e. conductor seat of the Bus. If he is believed, then version of respondent no.1 is also true that Bus dashed against the Tipper when same had already turned turtle on the road and so PW8 Ajay Kumar has rightly deposed before other Court that he had not seen driver of the Tipper at the spot. 38.It is matter of record that most of the other injured persons, who were travelling in the Bus on that day, while appearing as witnesses in the criminal case titled as State versus Rohit Kumar, admitted that there was curve near the place of occurrence and when driver of Tipper applied brakes, the Tipper turned turtle on the road and they deposed that can not identify driver of the Tipper. They admitted that Bus had entered the mud of the Tipper. 39.After considering the statement dated 16.2.2016 Ex.P41 of Pawan Kumar, this Tribunal is of the view that version of PW10 Pawan Kumar is not believable, as had it been a case of head-on-collision, the driver side of the Tipper would have damaged totally as impact of the accident was such that many persons travelling in the Bus died and other occupants of the Bus suffered grievous injuries. The case file of criminal case titled as “State versus Rohit” was also summoned at the time of arguments in this case and photographs of Tipper bearing registration AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 42 no.HR37C/8635 are on that judicial file, from which it is apparent that driver side of the Tipper even did not hit the Bus and so version of claimants specifically PW10 (driver of bus) regarding head-on-collision is totally false. The photographs on record of criminal case file speak otherwise and substantiate the arguments raised by ld. counsel for respondents no.1 to 3. 40.Sudden crossing of the road by a human being or a child; sudden presence of a stray animal on the road; bursting of tyre due to some alien sharp edge article lying on the road; sudden collapse of the bridge; fall of electric wires; tornado; storm; flush of rain water from cloud burst, etc. are a few illustrative circumstances in which driver of a vehicle can possibly lose control. In any such like sudden events, the drive would try to control the vehicle and may apply sudden brakes, which, instead of stopping the vehicle, may over turn it or cause slip thereby the vehicle might go out of the driver's control. Such kind of accident, happening of which is beyond the control of a driver, may be termed as an “act of God”. However, where the vehicle was in sound roadworthy condition and was driven with an ordinary care, it shall always be expected that it will not go out of control of the driver, yet if any such thing happens, heavy onus shall lie upon either the driver or the owner of the vehicle to divulge that special knowledge of the relevant facts to explain as to why and how the vehicle went out of control of the driver. In the absence of any such explanation, the maxim ' res ipsa loquitur' would undoubtedly be attracted, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 43 Court in Krishna Bus Service Ltd. vs. Smt. Mangli and others AIR 1976 SC 700. 41.The site plan prepared by police after the accident is on record as Ex.P40, from which it is clear that there was a curve near the place of accident and so the version of RW1 Rohit Kumar is believable that in order to avoid the accident with tractor, he had applied brakes and the tractor turned turtle. However, considering the fact that he was also driving at very high speed and that had he been driving at moderate speed, he could have controlled the vehicle. The principle of res ipsa loquitur applies to this case and it can be safely concluded that respondent no.4 was also responsible and had contributed in causing the accident. It is a clear cut case of contributory negligence. From photographs on record, it is apparent that the sand/soil entered the Bus up to about six feet from front of the Bus and it speaks about the speed, at which respondent no.1 was driving the Bus. 42.The claimants and their witnesses had tried their best to prove that it was head-on-collision and respondent no.1 was responsible for the accident. However after perusing entire record and statements of witnesses in criminal case titled as 'State versus Rohit', it is clear that there was a curve near the place of accident and somehow on applying brakes, the Tipper turned turtle on the road, which shows that respondent no.1 was driving the Tipper at high speed and had he been driving at moderate speed, he could have controlled his vehicle, but failed to do so. But on the other hand, it is also clear that respondent no.4 Pawan Kumar AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 44 was driving the Bus at such a high speed that mud loaded in the Tipper entered the Bus, as clear from admissions made by the witnesses and photographs clicked after the accident, which are on record of criminal case file. The quantity of sand/soil entered the Bus was so much that the occupants of the Bus felt suffocated and this suffocation was also the result of some deaths. Had respondent no.4 been driving the College Bus at moderate speed and in a careful manner, even if the Tipper had turned turtle in front of the Bus, the accident could have been avoided. So this can be safely concluded that respondent no.4 Pawan Kumar, driver of the Bus, was also responsible in causing of the accident and so accident was the result of negligence on the part of respondent no.1 (Rohit Kumar) and respondent no.4 (Pawan Kumar) and it is a case of contributory negligence. Both drivers were equally responsible for the accident. 43.After considering the entire evidence on record, it is held that claimed have successfully proved that Aman Sharma, Ajay Kumar, Pritam Singh, Yogesh, Pawan, Vivek and Amit Saini had suffered injuries in the accident in dispute and Deepak Sharma, Parminder Singh, Aamir Furqan and Manish Kumar died due to the injuries suffered in the accident in question. 44.After considering entire evidence on record and keeping in view the above discussion, it is held that accident was not the result of rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 only, but respondent no.4 had also contributed in causing of the accident and both drivers were equally responsible in causing the accident on that day. It is a case of AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 45 contributory negligence. Issue no.1 is decided accordingly.

In cross examination, she deposed AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 46 that she has not brought any proof regarding injuries suffered by her, treatment, medical expenses and her income. 47.To substantiate her claim regarding her disability and injuries suffered in the accident, she has placed on record MLR Ex.P43 and Disability Certificate, issued by Medical Board of three doctors of General Hospital, Ambala City, as Ex.P44. From the MLR Ex.P43, it is clear that she suffered one injury i.e. on leg below knee joint. Due to fracture, she was operated upon and due to the injuries suffered, she suffered permanent disability.

In view of the fact that she suffered permanent disability to the extent of 5%, Rs.10,000/- is awarded under the head of permanent disability. 48.Neither prescription slips nor any Bill showing purchase of medicines has been placed on record by the claimant to substantiate her claim regarding amount spent on treatment.

So, in total, Rs.40,000/- is awarded to claimant as compensation in this case. MACP No.209 of 2015 Manju vs. Rohit & others 49.This claim petition has been filed by petitioners claiming compensation on account of death of Deepak Sharma in the accident in question. Manju, mother of Deepak Sharma (now deceased) appeared as AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 47 PW2 and filed her affidavit Ex.PW2/A, wherein she deposed that her son Deepak Sharma was 27 years of age at the time of his death and was hale and hearty. She further deposed that he was employed as Lecturer of Mechanical Engineering in SRM College, village Bhurewala, District Ambala with management of Shree Ram Mulkh Institute of Engineering and Technology, village Bhurewala, District Ambala and was getting salary of Rs.25,000/- per month and was also taking tuition, thereby earning Rs.10,000/- per month.

He proved Salary Certificate Ex.P7, Appointment letter Ex.P8, Joining letter Ex.P9 and Attendance Register Ex.P10. In cross-examination, he deposed that as per Ex.P9, he joined as Lecturer Mechanical. 51.No evidence has been lead to probe income from any other source viz tuition etc. From the statement of PW13, it is clear that Deepak Sharma was not a regular employee and was only a Guest Lecturer against salary of Rs.21,600/- per month. Accordingly, his income is assessed as Rs.21,600/- per month. In this petition, claimants are parents of deceased. In this petition, claimants are parents of deceased Deepak Sharma. The AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 48 deceased was unmarried son of claimants and so half of monthly income assessed is to be deducted towards personal expenses of deceased.

Vipin Kumar Sharma, 2015 AIR SCW 3105, age of the deceased is relevant for selection of multiplier, which is to be used while assessing compensation on account where parents are the claimants. On applying multiplier of '17', amount of compensation to be awarded under the head of loss of dependency comes to Rs.22,03,200/-. Rs.1,00,000/- each is awarded in favour of claimants under the head of loss of love and affection and Rs.25,000/- is awarded under the head of last rites. Accordingly, total compensation of Rs.24,28,200/- is awarded in favour of petitioners. The petitioners will get equal share out of the compensation awarded in this case.

Accordingly, loss of dependency comes to Rs.6000/- per month and Rs.72,000/- per annum. At the time of death, age of deceased was 26 years as per claimants and so multiplier of 17 is to be applied in this case in view of the law laid down in the case of Sarla Verma versus DTC 2009 (6) SCC 121 and on applying of 17, total loss of dependency comes to Rs.12,24,000/-.

Respondents no.1 to 3 will be jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the extent of their share and in the like manner, respondents no.4 to 6 will also be jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the extent of their share.

FIR was also registered on the statement of Surinder Kumar -driver of the three wheeler in which she alongwith deceased was travelling and he noted the number of the offending car. The offending car hit the three wheeler in which the claimant along with deceased was travelling which itself shows rashness and negligence of the offending vehicle. The FIR was also registered promptly. The respondent no.1 after facing trial was acquitted vide judgement dated 3.12.2015 passed by Shri Ravish Kaushik, the then learned JMIC Ambala in case titled as State Vs. Anand Bisht. 17There is no rebuttal to the evidence led by the claimant. Respondent no.1 has not appeared in the witness box and stayed away from the proceedings, therefore, an adverse inference has to be drawn against him. Rakesh Singh, ADJ Shadi Devi and another Vs. Anand Bist etc. 10 18Thus, there is no escape from the conclusion that the accident in question causing injuries to the deceased Ram Kishan took place due to the rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 Anand Bisht while driving car bearing number HR-06M/0096, which is owned by respondent no.2 and insured with respondent no.3. This issue is decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.5: 19.Onus to prove this issue was on respondent no.3. This issue pertains on the question whether at the time of accident respondent no.1 who was allegedly driving the vehicle involved in the accident was having a valid and effective driving licence or not. 20No driving licence of respondent no.1 has been placed on record. Therefore, in the absence of Driving Licence it can be inferred that the respondent no.1 was not having any any valid and effective driving licence. As such this issue is decided in favour of the respondent no.3 and against the claimants/respondent no.1. ISSUE NO.2: 21This issue pertains to the amount of compensation and by whom it is to be paid to the petitioners. 22 In this regard there is no evidence to the effect that because of the injuries caused in the accident Ram Kishan expired. Thus, this is a not a death case. Therefore, at the best the petitioners can be entitled to receive the claim with regard to the injuries caused to Ram Kishan as well as expenses incurred with regard to the said injuries caused to deceased. Rakesh Singh, ADJ Shadi Devi and another Vs. Anand Bist etc. 11 In this regard PW4 Doctor Nirmal Singh has specifically stated that nothing was charged for the treatment of the deceased Ram Kishan during his treatment. Moreover, no bill has been produced on record by the petitioners in this regard. Therefore, I have no hesitation in holding that the claimants are not entitled to receive any amount on account of the treatment of the deceased Ram Kishan. Thus, this issue is accordingly decided against the petitioners and in favour of the respondents. ISSUES NO.3 & 4: 23In view of my findings on issues no.1 and 2, the petition of the petitioners is very well maintainable and they have not suppressed the true and material facts from the court. Hence, both these issues are decided in favour of the petitioners and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.6 (RELIEF): 24In view of the above findings given on all the issues, the present claim petition is hereby dismissed with costs. Memo of costs be prepared.

He has further stated that as per FIR Maruti car bearing registration number HR- 06M-0096 was involved in the accident which was released on superdari on 24.8.2013 and as per registration certificate the owner of the car is Manjeet Singh Kapoor. He has further stated that three wheeler bearing registration number HR-37C-0213 was also involved in the accident which was released on superdari on 20.8.2013 in favour of Surinder Kumar son of Kishan Lal r/o Kalaheri. In the above said case, charge was framed against Anand Bist on 13.12.2013. In his cross-examination he has admitted that Surinder Kumar son of Kishan Lal-alleged eye witness was declared hostile as per record. He has further stated that accused Anand Bist-respondent no.1 has Rakesh Singh, ADJ Shadi Devi and another Vs. Anand Bist etc. 9 been acquitted on 3.12.2015 by the order of Shri Ravish Kaushik, JMIC, Ambala. He has further stated that this case was related to injuries and charge was framed on 13.12.2013. 16 There is a statement of eye witness Shadi Devi on the file. she deposed the manner of accident, sustaining injuries by Ram Kishan in the accident and shifting him to Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt. where he remained admitted for about twenty days. She also deposed that thereafter he was got admitted in Medical college, Gadhouli Distt. Yamuna Nagar and he died on 20.12.2013 due to head injury and grievous injury in the leg. She has specifically stated herself that accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of car bearing registration No.HR-06M-0096 being driven by respondent no.1. FIR was also registered on the statement of Surinder Kumar -driver of the three wheeler in which she alongwith deceased was travelling and he noted the number of the offending car. The offending car hit the three wheeler in which the claimant along with deceased was travelling which itself shows rashness and negligence of the offending vehicle. The FIR was also registered promptly. The respondent no.1 after facing trial was acquitted vide judgement dated 3.12.2015 passed by Shri Ravish Kaushik, the then learned JMIC Ambala in case titled as State Vs. Anand Bisht. 17There is no rebuttal to the evidence led by the claimant. Respondent no.1 has not appeared in the witness box and stayed away from the proceedings, therefore, an adverse inference has to be drawn against him. Rakesh Singh, ADJ Shadi Devi and another Vs. Anand Bist etc. 10 18Thus, there is no escape from the conclusion that the accident in question causing injuries to the deceased Ram Kishan took place due to the rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 Anand Bisht while driving car bearing number HR-06M/0096, which is owned by respondent no.2 and insured with respondent no.3. This issue is decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.5: 19.Onus to prove this issue was on respondent no.3. This issue pertains on the question whether at the time of accident respondent no.1 who was allegedly driving the vehicle involved in the accident was having a valid and effective driving licence or not. 20No driving licence of respondent no.1 has been placed on record. Therefore, in the absence of Driving Licence it can be inferred that the respondent no.1 was not having any any valid and effective driving licence. As such this issue is decided in favour of the respondent no.3 and against the claimants/respondent no.1. ISSUE NO.2: 21This issue pertains to the amount of compensation and by whom it is to be paid to the petitioners. 22 In this regard there is no evidence to the effect that because of the injuries caused in the accident Ram Kishan expired. Thus, this is a not a death case. Therefore, at the best the petitioners can be entitled to receive the claim with regard to the injuries caused to Ram Kishan as well as expenses incurred with regard to the said injuries caused to deceased. Rakesh Singh, ADJ Shadi Devi and another Vs. Anand Bist etc. 11 In this regard PW4 Doctor Nirmal Singh has specifically stated that nothing was charged for the treatment of the deceased Ram Kishan during his treatment. Moreover, no bill has been produced on record by the petitioners in this regard. Therefore, I have no hesitation in holding that the claimants are not entitled to receive any amount on account of the treatment of the deceased Ram Kishan. Thus, this issue is accordingly decided against the petitioners and in favour of the respondents. ISSUES NO.3 & 4: 23In view of my findings on issues no.1 and 2, the petition of the petitioners is very well maintainable and they have not suppressed the true and material facts from the court. Hence, both these issues are decided in favour of the petitioners and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.6 (RELIEF): 24In view of the above findings given on all the issues, the present claim petition is hereby dismissed with costs. Memo of costs be prepared. File be consigned to record room after due compliance. ANNOUNCED: (RAKESH SINGH ) DT.28.4.2016 MOTOR ACCIDENT CLAIMS TRIBUNAL, AMBALA.

K. Rathour, Counsel for the petitioner. Shri D. S. Chillar, Counsel for Respondents No. 1 & 2. Shri Mohinder Bindal, Counsel for the respondent No.3. AWARD:- Claimant Satish Kumar has brought this claim petition SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 2 under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, for grant of compensation of Rs.15,00,000/- on account of injuries suffered by him in a road side accident, which was taken place on 02.05.2015 at about 6.30 PM near Holi Bus Stop on Dosarka to Shahbad road, while driving the offending vehicle bearing Registration No. HR-02-AD-9465 in a very rash and negligent manner by respondent No.1, and FIR No.70 dated 02.05.2015 under section 279, 337/304-A of IPC was registered at Police Station Mullana. After the accident, claimant got medical treatment in M. M. Hospital Mullana District Ambala and spent amount of Rs. Five lacs on his treatment and amount of Rs. Two lacs are required to be spend on follow up treatment. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 and the offending vehicle was owned by respondent No.2 and was insured with respondent No.3 at the day of accidence and as such they all are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation, hence, this petition. 2Respondent no.1 to 3 contested this petition by filing written statements separately. Respondents No.1 and 2 took preliminary objection regarding concealment of true and material facts and no accident took place as alleged. On merit, they denied the factum of accident, however, admitted the factum of ownership and insurance of offending vehicle and further stated that claimant is not entitled to any compensation and prayed for dismissal the same. 3Respondent No.3 Insurance Company took preliminary objections to the effect that claim petition qua the answering respondent is SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 3 ex-facie, misconceived, vexatious, untenable and devoid of merit; that no case is made out against the answering respondent, hence, the present claim petition be dismissed with costs; that no accident as alleged taken place involving the alleged motorcycle bearing Registration No. HR-02- AD-9465, however, it seems that the present claim petition has been filed in collusion with respondents No.1 and 2 just to extract compensation from the answering respondent by falsely impleading the said motorcycle in this case on flimsy and manipulated grounds and version by introducing and managing false evidence and witnesses; that if it is presumed though not admitted that any accident has taken place on the aforesaid date, even then the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation since the claimant suffered the alleged injuries due to sole rash and negligent driving of the motorcycle No. HR-01W-3595 at a fast and uncontrollable speed by its driver and against law as well without caring the rules and traffic on the road and also due to skidding; that the present claim petition is bad for want of joinder and non joinder of necessary parties, since the owner and insurer of the motorcycle No. HR- 01W-3595 has not been made party to this case, inspite of the fact that the accident in question has taken place due to sole negligence of its driver; that if the cause of accident is proved, then the answering respondent is not liable to indemnify the owner qua the alleged motorcycle No. HR-02- AD-9465 since the driver of alleged motorcycle was not having a valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident and he was driving in violation of the terms and conditions of the insurance SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 4 policy; that answering respondent reserves its right to take all defences and pleas available to respondents No.1 and 2, the owner and driver of the alleged motorcycle No. HR-02AD-9465 under section 147, 149 (2), 157 and 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and in terms of the policy of insurance. On merit, it is denied that claimant was involved in any milk dairy or that he was an earning hand even or that he was earning Rs.20,000/- per month; no accident as alleged has taken place with the alleged motorcycle in question. However, a false and manipulated FIR was registered in connivance with the local police and seems ti be in collusion with respondents No.1 and 2 on flimsy and manipulated grounds by introducing false witnesses. It is submitted that the claimant was travelling upon the offending motorcycle as pillion rider. It is denied that claimant remained under alleged treatment or that he has spent Rs.5 lacs on his alleged treatment and that any such amount is more required for any further treatment. The alleged motorcycle No. HR-02AD-9465 was not involved in the alleged accident. However, the amount claimed is imaginary and exaggerated one. No accident as alleged taken place involving the alleged motorcycle bearing Registration No. HR-02AD- 9465, however, it seems that in collusion with respondent No.1 and 2, the alleged motorcycle was introduced falsely and malafidely in the present case on flimsy grounds by managing and manipulating false evidence and witnesses. If it is presumed though not admitted that any accident has taken place on the aforesaid date, even then the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation since the claimant has suffered the SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 5 alleged injuries due to sole rash and negligent driving of the motorcycle No. HR-01W-3595 by its driver and against law and without caring the rules and traffic on the road and skidding thereof due to fast and uncontrollable speed. However, the claimant manipulated the facts and implicated the alleged motorcycle in question in the case in hand just to extract compensation from its insurance company. It is denied that the claimant suffered the alleged injuries or that he remained under alleged treatment or that he suffered physically and academically. Since this petition has been filed on false, frivolous grounds and without any cause of action against the answering respondent and has been filed only to extract compensation from the answering respondent, hence, prayed for dismissal the claim petition with costs. 4Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed vide order dated 15.12.2015:- 1Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1 while driving Motorcycle bearing registration No. HR-02-AD-9465 resulting into causing injuries to claimant Satish Kumar, as alleged ?

OPR 5Whether the claimant has not come to the court with clean hands and has suppressed true and material facts from the court, if so, its effect ? OPR SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 6 6Whether the claim petition is bad for mis joinder and non joinder of necessary parties ? OPR 7Whether respondent No.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect ?

He also produced following medical bills/documents:- Ex.P1 Bill dated 09.05.2015 Rs.20,286/- Ex.P2Bill dated 01.05.2015 Rs.7,289/- Ex.P3Bill dated 6.5.2015 Rs.11,065/- Ex.P4Bill dated 04/5.05.2015 Rs.11,401/- Ex.P5Bill dated 2/3.05.2015 Rs.8,334/- Ex.P6Bill dated 02.05.2015 Rs.75/- Ex.P7Bill dated 05.05.2015 Rs.195/- Ex.P8Bill dated 02.05.2015 Rs.75/- Ex.P9Bill dated 04.05.2015 Rs.130/- Ex.P10Bill dated 03.05.2015 Rs.600/- Ex.P11Bill dated 03.05.2015 Rs.60/- Ex.P12Bill dated 02.05.2015 Rs.1,000/- Ex.P13Bill dated 02.05.2015 Rs.75/- Ex.P14Bill dated 02.05.2015 Rs.75/- Ex.P15Bill dated 05.06.2015 Rs.500/- Ex.P16 to 25Bill dated 01.05.2015 Rs.927/- Ex.P26Bill dated 03.05.2015 Rs.44/- Ex.P27Bill dated 03.05.2015 Rs.153/- Ex.P28Copy of charge sheet; Ex.P29Copy of report u/s 173 Cr.P.C Ex.P30Copy of site plan SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 8 Ex.P31Copy of FIR Ex.P32Copy of Adhar Card of Satish Kumar Ex.P33Copy of ration card In cross-examination, he answered that he is not witness to the accident. At the time of accident, he was present at the place of his posting at Sarahan Bonda, District Shimla (HP). He was also cross- examined on other various questions. The evidence of claimant was closed. On the other hand. Learned counsel for respondents No.1 and 2 tendered copy of driving licence as Ex.RX and closed their evidence. Further, counsel for respondent No.3 tendered copy of insurance policy as Ex.R1, two notices to respondents No.1 and 2 along with postal receipts as Ex.R2 to Ex.R5, DL verification reports Ex.R6 and Ex.R7 and closed the evidence. No rebuttal evidence was led though opportunity for the same was afforded and same was closed. 6I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1: 7 Under this issue, claimant is required to establish the fact that motor vehicular accident was occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of motorcycle bearing registration No. HR-02-AD-9465 by Respondent no.1, as a result of that claimant sustained multiple injuries. Learned counsel for claimant has argued that PW1 Sant Ram is the witness of scene of crime, who proved the factum of rash and negligent driving by respondent No.1 He further argued that one person was also SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 9 died in this accident and so FIR No.70 dated 02.05.2015 under sections 279, 337, 304-A of IPC was registered against respondent No.1, deceased was having no surviving dependent members and so no claim petion was instituted. He further argued that on culmination of investigation, final report was also presented against respondent No.1, who is facing trial. He urged that this issue be decided against respondent no.1. 8On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents No.1,2 and 3 did not raise any contention on this issue. 9Having regard to the rival contentions put forth by counsel for parties and perusing the entire record, it is observed that claimant has come to this tribunal with categorical stand that respondent No.1 while driving the Vehicle bearing registration No. HR-02-AD-9465 came from the side of Dosarka being driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and utter violation of traffic rules, directly hit the motorcycle of the occupant bearing registration No. HR-01-W-3595, as a result of that, both the occupants of accidental motorcycle suffered injuries and one occupant namely Pardeep Kumar was died due to multiple and grievous injuries suffered by him in this accident and Satish Kumar (claimant) sustained multiple and grievous injuries. In order to prove this issue, PW1 appeared in the witness box and proved the factum of accident against respondent no.1. Although PW1 was cross-examined at length on various questions, but nothing fruitful could be extracted disbelieving the factum of involvement of offending vehicle bearing registration No. HR-02-AD- 9465 in this accident. It is quite well settled that the lodging of first SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 10 information report is not an essential prerequisite for claiming compensation arising from a motor accident. Each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The Tribunal has to decide the case on the basis of evidence available on file without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled preposition of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. However, in a motor accident claim, the claimant is not required to prove the case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. The claimant is required to establish that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts on the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way alleged by the claimant. It must be remembered that in a criminal case, prosecution is required to prove its case beyond shadow of reasonable doubt. The provisions regarding claim under the Act are enacted by keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimant is always entitled for compensation irrespective whether the police has registered the offence regarding the incident or not because no claim case can be left over on the mercy of the police. It can be said that statement of PW1 is sufficient to establish that the accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1, who is 'undisputed, facing trial under sections 279,337,304-A of IPC. In this way, it can be easily said that petitioner- claimant received multiple injuries in the motor vehicular accident due to SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 11 rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1, who has been facing trial, according to evidence available against him. In view of law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993(2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008(2) R.C.R. (civil) 774 , this Tribunal is of the considered opinion that there is cogent and consistent evidence on file to reach the formidable conclusion that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. Accordingly, issued no.1 is decided in favour of petitioner-claimant. ISSUE NO.2: 10 Under this issue, claimant is required to establish as to what amount of compensation is to be awarded, and if any, with whom, the amount shall be recovered. Learned counsel for the claimant has submitted that claimant was studying in 10th standard and was helping in the working of his father PW2, but due to injuries received by him in this accident, he could not help his father. Further, expenses of Rs.62284/-{ in round figure of Rs.62500/-} as per medical bills Ex.P1 to Ex.P27 were accrued, which were defrayed by PW2. He further submitted that petitioner remained hospitalized for few days, but his medical record was burnt which was attached with state case file pending before court of Rajvinder Singh Learned Judicial Magistrate Ist Class and due to this reason admission/discharge slip for a period between 1.5.2015 to 09.05.2015 could not be produced and prayed for awarding appropriate compensation to the injured. 11On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents No.1 and SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 12 2 has argued that offending vehicle was duly insured with insurance company and further respondent no.1 was holding valid Driving Licence EX.RX and so, if any amount of compensation is awarded, then insurance company is liable to indemnify the insured and prayed for deciding this issue against respondent No.3. 12 Learned counsel for respondent No.3 has argued that claimant has procured medical bills Ex.P1 to Ex.P27 without corroborated treatment record and further respondent No.1 was not holding a valid driving licence Ex.RX at the date of accident. He further argued that though D/L EX.RX has been produced, but data of said D/L is not available on internet website of Nagaland Government. However, if any driving licence is issued under Saarthi Scheme introduced by Government of Nagaland, then its data must remain available on website automatically but despite verification by insurance company data of driving licence Ex.RX could not be available and so this DL is presumed to be fake and in-genuine and prayed for shifting liability to pay the amount of compensation against respondents No.1 and 2. 13 Having due regard to the contention and perusing the evidence, it can be gathered that a s per record, claimant was admitted in M. M. Hospital after sustaining injuries in road side accident. It is also evident that claimant had spent a total sum of Rs.62,500/-{ in round figure 68500/-} according to medical Bills Ex.P1 to Ex.P27. Although claiamnt could not be able to produce medical record due to burnt of criminal case file but injury on the person of claimant wold show that he SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 13 must gor treatment as indoor patient for five days. Additionally, he must have spent some amount on rich diet, attendants, transportation, visitors, follow up treatment etc. In Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences versus Prasanth S.Dhananka, 2010 ACJ 38 (SC) , by the three-Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court, it was observed that sympathy for the victim does not, and should not, come in the way of making a correct assessment, but if a case is made out, the Court must not be chary of awarding adequate compensation. It was further observed that the case of an injured and disabled person is, however, more pitiable and the feeling of hurt, helplessness, despair and often destitution ensues every day. The support that is needed by a severely handicapped person comes at an enormous price, physical, financial and emotional, not only on the victim but even more so on his family and attendants and the stress saps their energy and destroys their equanimity. In Arvind Kumar Mishra versus New India Assurance Company Limited, 2010 ACJ 2867 (SC); i t was observed that the whole idea is put the claimant in the same position as he was insofar as money concerned and Perfect compensation is hardly possible but one has to keep in mind that the victim has done no wrong; he has suffered at the hands of the wrongdoer and the Court must take care to give him full and fair compensation for what he had suffered. 14 It is further made clear that claimant did not receive physical permanent disability. In view of overall facts and circumstances arising out in this petition, this Tribunal finds justification in assessing compensation according to injuries attributed to claimant as per settled SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 14 preposition of law in Raj Kumar Vs Ajay Kumar, (2011)1 SCC 343 , the petitioner-claimant is held entitled to the following compensation: Pecuniary damages (Special damages) (i).Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and miscellaneous expenditure.Rs.62500 /-plus {1000/- per day as indoor patient Rs-5000/- including all expenses. (ii).Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising: (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment; (b) Loss of future earning on account of injuries etc. nil/- nil (iii). Future medical expenses. 5000 - None-pecuniary damages (General damages) (iv). Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries. 5000 /- (v). Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage). nil (vi).Loss of expectation of life ( shortening of normal longevity). nil /- Total Compensation Rs.77,500/- 15 In view of law laid down in case New India Assurance company limited versus Charlie and another, 2005 (2) Recent Civil Reports 550 , the petitioner is also entitled to interest @ 7.5% per annum on the total awarded compensation from the date of filing of petition till realization of awarded amount. The computation of compensation is just, equitable, fair and reasonable. Remaining relief sought by petitioner- claimant stand declined. The question of liability to pay compensation amount shall be decided under issue no.7 below. Accordingly, Issue no.2 is decided in the above stated terms, in favour of the petitioner and against SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 15 the respondents. ISSUE NO. 3 to 6 & 8 : 16 The onus to prove these issues are upon Respondents, but they neither pressed these issues nor led any evidence. Further it has been discussed in detail under issue no.1, that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and thus it can not be said that no accident was taken place with offending vehicle or the instant claim petition is not maintainable etc. In this way, it has become obvious for this tribunal that respondents failed to prove these issues and as such this tribunal has left with no other option except to decide the same against Respondents. Accordingly, these issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.7: 17 The onus to prove this issue is upon the respondent No.3, who is under the obligation to prove this fact that the respondent No.1 was not holding a valid driving licence at the day of alleged accident and as such respondent no 2 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy EX.R1 and so respondent No.3 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimant. However, it is apparent on the face of record that respondent no.1&2 have produced copy of DL EX.RX which has been issued on Smart card from Nagaland. It has notified on 1 Aug.2014 by state of Nagaland that now D/L has been issued on Smart Card through National Software SAARTHI from 30th October 2009 in the State. This D/L EX.RX was issued on smart card and if data is not found SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 16 available on Internet due to unloaded, even then, it shall not presume that respondent No.1 was holding fake or in-genuine driving license EX.RX at the day of accident, rather question of fake D/L must be proved beyond doubts. Needless to state, Insurance Policy Ex.R1 reveals that offending vehicle was insured with the respondent No.3 at the relevant time. In the fact and circumstances, respondents are held jointly and severally liable to pay the awarded compensation to the claimant and respondent no.3 shall indemnify the insured. Accordingly, this Issue is decided partly against the respondent No.3. ISSUE NO.9 (RELIEF): PETITION SUCCEED S 18 In view of the foregoing discussion, instant claim petition stands allowed with costs in a manner that the claimant-petitioner is entitled to compensation of Rs.77,500/ - along with interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition till the date of actual payment. The awarded amount along with the interest shall be payable jointly and severally by Respondents and Respondent no.3 shall indemnify the insured respectively. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.3000/-. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly. After due compliance, file be consigned to records. Announced in open Court. (Dr. Sanjeev Arya) Dated:26.04.2016 Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, (I.B) Ambala.

K. Rathour, Counsel for the petitioner. Shri D. S. Chillar, Counsel for Respondents No. 1 & 2. Shri Mohinder Bindal, Counsel for the respondent No.3. AWARD:- Claimant Satish Kumar has brought this claim petition SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 2 under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, for grant of compensation of Rs.15,00,000/- on account of injuries suffered by him in a road side accident, which was taken place on 02.05.2015 at about 6.30 PM near Holi Bus Stop on Dosarka to Shahbad road, while driving the offending vehicle bearing Registration No. HR-02-AD-9465 in a very rash and negligent manner by respondent No.1, and FIR No.70 dated 02.05.2015 under section 279, 337/304-A of IPC was registered at Police Station Mullana. After the accident, claimant got medical treatment in M. M. Hospital Mullana District Ambala and spent amount of Rs. Five lacs on his treatment and amount of Rs. Two lacs are required to be spend on follow up treatment. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 and the offending vehicle was owned by respondent No.2 and was insured with respondent No.3 at the day of accidence and as such they all are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation, hence, this petition. 2Respondent no.1 to 3 contested this petition by filing written statements separately. Respondents No.1 and 2 took preliminary objection regarding concealment of true and material facts and no accident took place as alleged. On merit, they denied the factum of accident, however, admitted the factum of ownership and insurance of offending vehicle and further stated that claimant is not entitled to any compensation and prayed for dismissal the same. 3Respondent No.3 Insurance Company took preliminary objections to the effect that claim petition qua the answering respondent is SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 3 ex-facie, misconceived, vexatious, untenable and devoid of merit; that no case is made out against the answering respondent, hence, the present claim petition be dismissed with costs; that no accident as alleged taken place involving the alleged motorcycle bearing Registration No. HR-02- AD-9465, however, it seems that the present claim petition has been filed in collusion with respondents No.1 and 2 just to extract compensation from the answering respondent by falsely impleading the said motorcycle in this case on flimsy and manipulated grounds and version by introducing and managing false evidence and witnesses; that if it is presumed though not admitted that any accident has taken place on the aforesaid date, even then the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation since the claimant suffered the alleged injuries due to sole rash and negligent driving of the motorcycle No. HR-01W-3595 at a fast and uncontrollable speed by its driver and against law as well without caring the rules and traffic on the road and also due to skidding; that the present claim petition is bad for want of joinder and non joinder of necessary parties, since the owner and insurer of the motorcycle No. HR- 01W-3595 has not been made party to this case, inspite of the fact that the accident in question has taken place due to sole negligence of its driver; that if the cause of accident is proved, then the answering respondent is not liable to indemnify the owner qua the alleged motorcycle No. HR-02- AD-9465 since the driver of alleged motorcycle was not having a valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident and he was driving in violation of the terms and conditions of the insurance SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 4 policy; that answering respondent reserves its right to take all defences and pleas available to respondents No.1 and 2, the owner and driver of the alleged motorcycle No. HR-02AD-9465 under section 147, 149 (2), 157 and 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and in terms of the policy of insurance. On merit, it is denied that claimant was involved in any milk dairy or that he was an earning hand even or that he was earning Rs.20,000/- per month; no accident as alleged has taken place with the alleged motorcycle in question. However, a false and manipulated FIR was registered in connivance with the local police and seems ti be in collusion with respondents No.1 and 2 on flimsy and manipulated grounds by introducing false witnesses. It is submitted that the claimant was travelling upon the offending motorcycle as pillion rider. It is denied that claimant remained under alleged treatment or that he has spent Rs.5 lacs on his alleged treatment and that any such amount is more required for any further treatment. The alleged motorcycle No. HR-02AD-9465 was not involved in the alleged accident. However, the amount claimed is imaginary and exaggerated one. No accident as alleged taken place involving the alleged motorcycle bearing Registration No. HR-02AD- 9465, however, it seems that in collusion with respondent No.1 and 2, the alleged motorcycle was introduced falsely and malafidely in the present case on flimsy grounds by managing and manipulating false evidence and witnesses. If it is presumed though not admitted that any accident has taken place on the aforesaid date, even then the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation since the claimant has suffered the SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 5 alleged injuries due to sole rash and negligent driving of the motorcycle No. HR-01W-3595 by its driver and against law and without caring the rules and traffic on the road and skidding thereof due to fast and uncontrollable speed. However, the claimant manipulated the facts and implicated the alleged motorcycle in question in the case in hand just to extract compensation from its insurance company. It is denied that the claimant suffered the alleged injuries or that he remained under alleged treatment or that he suffered physically and academically. Since this petition has been filed on false, frivolous grounds and without any cause of action against the answering respondent and has been filed only to extract compensation from the answering respondent, hence, prayed for dismissal the claim petition with costs. 4Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed vide order dated 15.12.2015:- 1Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1 while driving Motorcycle bearing registration No. HR-02-AD-9465 resulting into causing injuries to claimant Satish Kumar, as alleged ? OPP. 2If Issue No 1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom, the claimant is entitled to ? OPP. 3Whether petition is not maintainable in the present form ? OPR 4Whether the claimant has no cause of action to file the present petition ? OPR 5Whether the claimant has not come to the court with clean hands and has suppressed true and material facts from the court, if so, its effect ? OPR SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 6 6Whether the claim petition is bad for mis joinder and non joinder of necessary parties ? OPR 7Whether respondent No.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect ? OPR 8Whether respondent No.3 is entitled to take all the defences available to it under the M. V . Act ? OPR 9Relief 5To substantiate the factum of claim through this enquiry, claimant examined Sant Ram as PW1 {eye witness of accident} who tendered affidavit Ex.PW1/A proving the factum of rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. In cross-examination, he answered that he is running his repair shop at Barara. He used to go to Barara daily from Holi. The motorcycle on which the claimant was travelling, was coming from Barara side and other motorcycle was coming from Dosarka side. The claimant was coming to his house at Holi. The impact of Pulsar motorcycle on the motorcycle of claimant was on the centre portion of their motorcycle i.e on the portion where foot gear lever exists. The accident took place on the extreme left portion of the road while coming from Dosarka side towards village Holi. The driver of the motorcycle No. HR-01-W-3595 was from Nagala and the motorcycle was owned by one Rajinder of his village. He was also cross-examined on other questions. PW2 Ram Karan , is father of minor injured Satish Kumar, who tendered affidavit Ex.PW2/A mentioning therein that Satish Kumar was studying in 10th class and was helping him in running small scale dairy business in the village and was earning around Rs.20,000/- per SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 7 month at the time of accident. His son was unable to move from his bed for the period of six months due to the injuries suffered by him in this accident. He also produced following medical bills/documents:- Ex.P1 Bill dated 09.05.2015 Rs.20,286/- Ex.P2Bill dated 01.05.2015 Rs.7,289/- Ex.P3Bill dated 6.5.2015 Rs.11,065/- Ex.P4Bill dated 04/5.05.2015 Rs.11,401/- Ex.P5Bill dated 2/3.05.2015 Rs.8,334/- Ex.P6Bill dated 02.05.2015 Rs.75/- Ex.P7Bill dated 05.05.2015 Rs.195/- Ex.P8Bill dated 02.05.2015 Rs.75/- Ex.P9Bill dated 04.05.2015 Rs.130/- Ex.P10Bill dated 03.05.2015 Rs.600/- Ex.P11Bill dated 03.05.2015 Rs.60/- Ex.P12Bill dated 02.05.2015 Rs.1,000/- Ex.P13Bill dated 02.05.2015 Rs.75/- Ex.P14Bill dated 02.05.2015 Rs.75/- Ex.P15Bill dated 05.06.2015 Rs.500/- Ex.P16 to 25Bill dated 01.05.2015 Rs.927/- Ex.P26Bill dated 03.05.2015 Rs.44/- Ex.P27Bill dated 03.05.2015 Rs.153/- Ex.P28Copy of charge sheet; Ex.P29Copy of report u/s 173 Cr.P.C Ex.P30Copy of site plan SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 8 Ex.P31Copy of FIR Ex.P32Copy of Adhar Card of Satish Kumar Ex.P33Copy of ration card In cross-examination, he answered that he is not witness to the accident. At the time of accident, he was present at the place of his posting at Sarahan Bonda, District Shimla (HP). He was also cross- examined on other various questions. The evidence of claimant was closed. On the other hand. Learned counsel for respondents No.1 and 2 tendered copy of driving licence as Ex.RX and closed their evidence. Further, counsel for respondent No.3 tendered copy of insurance policy as Ex.R1, two notices to respondents No.1 and 2 along with postal receipts as Ex.R2 to Ex.R5, DL verification reports Ex.R6 and Ex.R7 and closed the evidence. No rebuttal evidence was led though opportunity for the same was afforded and same was closed. 6I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1: 7 Under this issue, claimant is required to establish the fact that motor vehicular accident was occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of motorcycle bearing registration No. HR-02-AD-9465 by Respondent no.1, as a result of that claimant sustained multiple injuries. Learned counsel for claimant has argued that PW1 Sant Ram is the witness of scene of crime, who proved the factum of rash and negligent driving by respondent No.1 He further argued that one person was also SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 9 died in this accident and so FIR No.70 dated 02.05.2015 under sections 279, 337, 304-A of IPC was registered against respondent No.1, deceased was having no surviving dependent members and so no claim petion was instituted. He further argued that on culmination of investigation, final report was also presented against respondent No.1, who is facing trial. He urged that this issue be decided against respondent no.1. 8On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents No.1,2 and 3 did not raise any contention on this issue. 9Having regard to the rival contentions put forth by counsel for parties and perusing the entire record, it is observed that claimant has come to this tribunal with categorical stand that respondent No.1 while driving the Vehicle bearing registration No. HR-02-AD-9465 came from the side of Dosarka being driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and utter violation of traffic rules, directly hit the motorcycle of the occupant bearing registration No. HR-01-W-3595, as a result of that, both the occupants of accidental motorcycle suffered injuries and one occupant namely Pardeep Kumar was died due to multiple and grievous injuries suffered by him in this accident and Satish Kumar (claimant) sustained multiple and grievous injuries. In order to prove this issue, PW1 appeared in the witness box and proved the factum of accident against respondent no.1. Although PW1 was cross-examined at length on various questions, but nothing fruitful could be extracted disbelieving the factum of involvement of offending vehicle bearing registration No. HR-02-AD- 9465 in this accident. It is quite well settled that the lodging of first SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 10 information report is not an essential prerequisite for claiming compensation arising from a motor accident. Each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The Tribunal has to decide the case on the basis of evidence available on file without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled preposition of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. However, in a motor accident claim, the claimant is not required to prove the case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. The claimant is required to establish that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts on the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way alleged by the claimant. It must be remembered that in a criminal case, prosecution is required to prove its case beyond shadow of reasonable doubt. The provisions regarding claim under the Act are enacted by keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimant is always entitled for compensation irrespective whether the police has registered the offence regarding the incident or not because no claim case can be left over on the mercy of the police. It can be said that statement of PW1 is sufficient to establish that the accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1, who is 'undisputed, facing trial under sections 279,337,304-A of IPC. In this way, it can be easily said that petitioner- claimant received multiple injuries in the motor vehicular accident due to SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 11 rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1, who has been facing trial, according to evidence available against him. In view of law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993(2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008(2) R.C.R. (civil) 774 , this Tribunal is of the considered opinion that there is cogent and consistent evidence on file to reach the formidable conclusion that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. Accordingly, issued no.1 is decided in favour of petitioner-claimant. ISSUE NO.2: 10 Under this issue, claimant is required to establish as to what amount of compensation is to be awarded, and if any, with whom, the amount shall be recovered. Learned counsel for the claimant has submitted that claimant was studying in 10th standard and was helping in the working of his father PW2, but due to injuries received by him in this accident, he could not help his father. Further, expenses of Rs.62284/-{ in round figure of Rs.62500/-} as per medical bills Ex.P1 to Ex.P27 were accrued, which were defrayed by PW2. He further submitted that petitioner remained hospitalized for few days, but his medical record was burnt which was attached with state case file pending before court of Rajvinder Singh Learned Judicial Magistrate Ist Class and due to this reason admission/discharge slip for a period between 1.5.2015 to 09.05.2015 could not be produced and prayed for awarding appropriate compensation to the injured. 11On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents No.1 and SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 12 2 has argued that offending vehicle was duly insured with insurance company and further respondent no.1 was holding valid Driving Licence EX.RX and so, if any amount of compensation is awarded, then insurance company is liable to indemnify the insured and prayed for deciding this issue against respondent No.3. 12 Learned counsel for respondent No.3 has argued that claimant has procured medical bills Ex.P1 to Ex.P27 without corroborated treatment record and further respondent No.1 was not holding a valid driving licence Ex.RX at the date of accident. He further argued that though D/L EX.RX has been produced, but data of said D/L is not available on internet website of Nagaland Government. However, if any driving licence is issued under Saarthi Scheme introduced by Government of Nagaland, then its data must remain available on website automatically but despite verification by insurance company data of driving licence Ex.RX could not be available and so this DL is presumed to be fake and in-genuine and prayed for shifting liability to pay the amount of compensation against respondents No.1 and 2. 13 Having due regard to the contention and perusing the evidence, it can be gathered that a s per record, claimant was admitted in M. M. Hospital after sustaining injuries in road side accident. It is also evident that claimant had spent a total sum of Rs.62,500/-{ in round figure 68500/-} according to medical Bills Ex.P1 to Ex.P27. Although claiamnt could not be able to produce medical record due to burnt of criminal case file but injury on the person of claimant wold show that he SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 13 must gor treatment as indoor patient for five days. Additionally, he must have spent some amount on rich diet, attendants, transportation, visitors, follow up treatment etc. In Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences versus Prasanth S.Dhananka, 2010 ACJ 38 (SC) , by the three-Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court, it was observed that sympathy for the victim does not, and should not, come in the way of making a correct assessment, but if a case is made out, the Court must not be chary of awarding adequate compensation. It was further observed that the case of an injured and disabled person is, however, more pitiable and the feeling of hurt, helplessness, despair and often destitution ensues every day. The support that is needed by a severely handicapped person comes at an enormous price, physical, financial and emotional, not only on the victim but even more so on his family and attendants and the stress saps their energy and destroys their equanimity. In Arvind Kumar Mishra versus New India Assurance Company Limited, 2010 ACJ 2867 (SC); i t was observed that the whole idea is put the claimant in the same position as he was insofar as money concerned and Perfect compensation is hardly possible but one has to keep in mind that the victim has done no wrong; he has suffered at the hands of the wrongdoer and the Court must take care to give him full and fair compensation for what he had suffered. 14 It is further made clear that claimant did not receive physical permanent disability. In view of overall facts and circumstances arising out in this petition, this Tribunal finds justification in assessing compensation according to injuries attributed to claimant as per settled SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 14 preposition of law in Raj Kumar Vs Ajay Kumar, (2011)1 SCC 343 , the petitioner-claimant is held entitled to the following compensation: Pecuniary damages (Special damages) (i).Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and miscellaneous expenditure.Rs.62500 /-plus {1000/- per day as indoor patient Rs-5000/- including all expenses. (ii).Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising: (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment; (b) Loss of future earning on account of injuries etc. nil/- nil (iii). Future medical expenses. 5000 - None-pecuniary damages (General damages) (iv). Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries. 5000 /- (v). Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage). nil (vi).Loss of expectation of life ( shortening of normal longevity). nil /- Total Compensation Rs.77,500/- 15 In view of law laid down in case New India Assurance company limited versus Charlie and another, 2005 (2) Recent Civil Reports 550 , the petitioner is also entitled to interest @ 7.5% per annum on the total awarded compensation from the date of filing of petition till realization of awarded amount. The computation of compensation is just, equitable, fair and reasonable. Remaining relief sought by petitioner- claimant stand declined. The question of liability to pay compensation amount shall be decided under issue no.7 below. Accordingly, Issue no.2 is decided in the above stated terms, in favour of the petitioner and against SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 15 the respondents. ISSUE NO. 3 to 6 & 8 : 16 The onus to prove these issues are upon Respondents, but they neither pressed these issues nor led any evidence. Further it has been discussed in detail under issue no.1, that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and thus it can not be said that no accident was taken place with offending vehicle or the instant claim petition is not maintainable etc. In this way, it has become obvious for this tribunal that respondents failed to prove these issues and as such this tribunal has left with no other option except to decide the same against Respondents. Accordingly, these issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.7: 17 The onus to prove this issue is upon the respondent No.3, who is under the obligation to prove this fact that the respondent No.1 was not holding a valid driving licence at the day of alleged accident and as such respondent no 2 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy EX.R1 and so respondent No.3 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimant. However, it is apparent on the face of record that respondent no.1&2 have produced copy of DL EX.RX which has been issued on Smart card from Nagaland. It has notified on 1 Aug.2014 by state of Nagaland that now D/L has been issued on Smart Card through National Software SAARTHI from 30th October 2009 in the State. This D/L EX.RX was issued on smart card and if data is not found SATISH KUMAR VS ASHU KUMAR ETC 16 available on Internet due to unloaded, even then, it shall not presume that respondent No.1 was holding fake or in-genuine driving license EX.RX at the day of accident, rather question of fake D/L must be proved beyond doubts. Needless to state, Insurance Policy Ex.R1 reveals that offending vehicle was insured with the respondent No.3 at the relevant time. In the fact and circumstances, respondents are held jointly and severally liable to pay the awarded compensation to the claimant and respondent no.3 shall indemnify the insured. Accordingly, this Issue is decided partly against the respondent No.3. ISSUE NO.9 (RELIEF): PETITION SUCCEED S 18 In view of the foregoing discussion, instant claim petition stands allowed with costs in a manner that the claimant-petitioner is entitled to compensation of Rs.77,500/ - along with interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition till the date of actual payment. The awarded amount along with the interest shall be payable jointly and severally by Respondents and Respondent no.3 shall indemnify the insured respectively. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.3000/-.

Claim petition under Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act. Present: Sh. Rohit Jain, counsel for the claimants. Sh. R.K. Kashyap, counsel for respondents No.1 & 2. Sh. R.K. Vig, counsel for respondent no.3. J U D G E M E N T: Jagjit Singh, MACT . Mahinder Singh etc . Vs . Gajanand etc 2 This claim petition under Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act for grant of compensation to the tune of Rs. 30,00,000/- on account of death of Krishna Devi wife of Mahinder Singh in a Motor vehicle accident has been filed by the petitioners. 2)Brief facts of the claim petition are that on 14.09.2015 the deceased Krishna Devi alongwith her husband Mahinder Singh was returning to their house from their Bara and at about 6.00 P.M. when they reached at turning point of village Barouli, a truck-Container bearing registration No.MH-12HD-5793 came from behind which was being driven by respondent no.1 at a high speed and in a rash and negligent manner and the driver of the truck swerved the vehicle at turn of Barouli, as a result of which the truck turned turtle and Krishna Devi was crushed under the said truck and the deceased received serious and grievous injuries and died at the spot. Matter was reported to the police and FIR was got registered against the respondent no.1. Lastly, it was prayed that compensation amount to the tune of Rs.30,00,000/- be awarded to them on account of death of deceased Krishna Devi wife of Mahinder Singh along with interest @ 18% per annum, from the date of filing of the petition till its realization, for which respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation. 3)The respondents No.1 and 2 being driver and owner of the offending truck filed joint written statement and denied the averments made in the petition and stated that no accident took place due to rash and Jagjit Singh, MACT . Mahinder Singh etc . Vs . Gajanand etc 3 negligent driving of respondent no.1, however, a false and frivolous FIR was registered against the respondent no.1 just to fetch the claim. All other material averments were denied and lastly prayed for dismissal of the petition. 4)Respondent No.3 Insurance Company contested the petition by filing separate joint written statement and it was submitted that driver of the offending vehicle/respondent No.1 was not having valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident and insured willfully violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. The factum of accident as alleged by the claimants in the petition was denied and submitted that a false FIR has been registered against respondent No.1 in collusion with the police. Also, the factum of rash and negligence of the offending vehicle was denied. Remaining contents of the petition were denied and prayer to dismiss the petition was made. 5)Replication was not filed. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed :- 1.Whether the accident in question causing death of Smt. Krishna Devi took place due to rash and negligent driving of Canter bearing registration No.MH-12HD- 5793 by respondent no.1, as alleged? OPP. 2.If issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation the petitioners are entitled to and from whom? OPP. 3.Whether the insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation, in view of the preliminary objections raised in the written statement and whether there has been a breach of terms and conditions of the Jagjit Singh, MACT . Mahinder Singh etc . Vs . Gajanand etc 4 policy of insurance? OPR-3 4.Relief. 6) In support of their case, claimant no.1 himself appeared in the witness box as PW-1 and also examined Baldev Raj as PW-2, Naresh Kumar as PW-3. Besides oral evidence, the following documents were placed on record:- Ex.P-1 :FIR Ex.P-2 :Post-mortem report Ex.P-3 :Charge sheet Thereafter, ld. Counsel for the petitioners closed the evidence. 7)On the other hand, the respondents have tendered the following documents:- Ex.R-1 :Copy of D.L. Ex.R-2 :Copy of R.C. Ex.R-3 :Copy of Insurance Policy Ex.R-4 :Route Permit Ex.R-5 :Fitness Certificate Ex.R-6 :Permit Ex.R-7 :Certificate of Tax Mark-A :Power of Attorney Thereafter learned counsel closed the evidence of respondents. Jagjit Singh, MACT . Mahinder Singh etc . Vs . Gajanand etc 5 8)No evidence in rebuttal was led by the petitioner. 9)I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the material placed on record. My issue-wise finding are given as under:- ISSUE No.1:- 10)The onus of proving this issue was on the petitioners and to prove the same, learned counsel for the petitioners argued that on 14.09.2015 the deceased Krishna Devi alongwith her husband Mahinder Singh was coming on foot to their village Barouli and at 6.00 P.M. near turning point a truck-container bearing No.MH-12HD-5793 came from behind driven in a rash and negligent manner by respondent no.1 and became out of control and turned turtle and Krishna Devi was crushed under the same. The respondent No.1 after leaving his truck ran away from the spot. The husband of the deceased, petitioner Mahinder Singh got the FIR registered and it also mentions the number of the offending truck as well as name of the respondent no.1 as the driver. This has also been deposed in the witness box by the petitioner no.1 as PW-1 and no rebuttal to this has coem on the part of the respondents. 11)Learned counsel for the respondents meanwhile argued that no such accident ever took place and a false claim petition has been filed by the petitioners. 12)I have heard the counsels for the parties and perused the file carefully. 13)Report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. and the FIR, Ex.P-1 Jagjit Singh, MACT . Mahinder Singh etc . Vs . Gajanand etc 6 mentions the manner in which the accident was caused and it also mentions the name of the offending driver i.e. respondent no.1 and the number of the vehicle driven by him. This was further deposed in the witness box by the petitioner as PW-1, who had got the FIR scribed and no rebuttal to this has come on the part of the respondents. Even otherwise, it is observed by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Smt. Surinder Kaur and others Versus Lakhbir Singh and another 2007(1) PLR 494 that; “F.I.R.-Being a public document is admissible in evidence as such and if no objection is raised at the time of production thereof, the same is to be read in evidence.” Similar view was held by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Bansi Yadav and another Versus Krishan Kumar and another 2004(3) ACC 758. Keeping in view the principle laid down in authorities (Supra), it becomes clear that the FIR being a public document and when not rebutted is to be considered as true. It is also important to note that the proceedings in MACT cases are of summary nature and the case is not to be proved like civil case where case is to be proved from the point of preponderance of probabilities or in criminal case, where charge is to be proved beyond shadows of doubt. The FIR has been registered against the respondent no.1. So, in view of law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993(2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Jagjit Singh, MACT . Mahinder Singh etc . Vs . Gajanand etc 7 Singh, 2008(2) R.C.R. (civil) 774, it can be safely held that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle truck bearing registration No.HR-12HD-5793 by respondent no.1. Accordingly, issue no.1 is decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUES No.2 AND 3:- 14)The onus of proving issue no.2 was on the petitioners while onus of proving issue no.3 was upon the respondents. Finding of one issue shall have bearing on the other and hence the same are being decided together. To prove the above issues, learned counsel for the petitioners argued that the deceased was working as a labourer and earning a good amount and was about 38 years old at the time of her death as mentioned in the postmortem report, Ex.P-2 and she has left behind her husband and four children as dependents and they are accordingly entitled to compensation in the present case. 15)Learned counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 meanwhile argued that although no accident was caused due to any fault of respondent No.1, but if the Tribunal comes to such conclusion, then the respondent no.1 holds a valid Driving Licence, Ex.R-1, registration certificate of the vehcile is Ex.R-2, insrance policy is Ex.R-3, permit is Ex.R-4 & R-6 and fitness certificate is Ex.R-5 and it is the respondent no.3, who is liable to pay the amount of compensation. Jagjit Singh, MACT . Mahinder Singh etc . Vs . Gajanand etc 8 16) Learned counsel for respondent no.3 meanwhile argued that all the petitioners cannot be considered as dependents upon the deceased since the petitioners no.2, 3 and 5 are major sons and this only leaves petitioner no.1, husband of the deceased and petitioner no.4, daughter of the deceased. The petitioners claims the age of the deceased as 38 years old but her son is 23 years old and it cannot be believed that he was born when the deceased was only 15 years old and even the daughter of the deceased was doing labour work and they all belong to BPL category and they cannot be said to have high income. That at the most the deceased can be considered as a house wife and her monthly earning could be considered Rs.3000/- per month and law that would apply in the present case Lata Wadhawa & Ors. Vs. State of Haryana, 2001(3) PLR 9 , where it is held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that “ Death of house wives – Age group 34 to 59 years who were active in life – Value of services rendered per annum to be Rs.36,000/- - Thereafter applying the multiplier – Compensation recalculated – Conventional amount of Rs.50,000/- added. ” Similar view was held in Arun Kumar Aggarwal & Anr. Vs. National Insurance Company & Ors., 2010(3) PLR 428 and The Oriental Insurance Company Limited Vs. Jagdish & Ors., FAO No.4004 of 2009 (P&H), Decided on 15.09.2010. Reliance was also placed upon Paramjit Singh & Anr. Vs. Dilbagh Singh & Ors., 2014 ACJ 1817 , where it has been held that Jagjit Singh, MACT . Mahinder Singh etc . Vs . Gajanand etc 9 “Housewife – Whether after assessing value of gratuitous services of housewife to her husband/children at Rs.3000/- p.m., deduction of 1/3rd may be made for her personal and living expenses while computing compensation for her death – Held: no; notional income has been assessed as monthly value of her services and not her monthly income. ” 17)I have heard the learned counsels for the parties and have perused the case file carefully. 18)The deceased in the present case was wife of petitioner no.1 and mother of other petitioners. It is however, seen that petitioners no.2, 3 and 5 are major sons and therefore, cannot be said to be in any manner dependent upon the deceased. The deceased is claimed to be 38 years old but cannot be said to have a child born at the age of 15 years because petitioner no.2, son of the deceased is 23 years old. Therefore, if the first child was born to the deceased when she was 19 years old then her age at the time of her death can be said to be atleast 42 years and no specific proof of her income has come on file and therefore, a notional income of Rs.3000/- per month is to be considered which would come as Rs.36,000/- per annum, which is held in Paramjit Singh's case (Supra) and thus no deduction is to be applied and only a multiplier is to be taken, and for the age of 42 years multiplier that would apply in the present case is that of '14' and by applying the same, the amount comes to Rs.5,04,000/-. Alongwith this the petitioner no.4 also becomes entitled to separate amount of Rs.50,000/- for loss of love and affection. The Jagjit Singh, MACT . Mahinder Singh etc . Vs . Gajanand etc 10 petitioners no.1 and 4 are also entitled to interest @ 7.5.% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization. 19)With regard to the liability of the respondents to pay the amount of compensation, it is seen that the respondent no.1 holds a valid D.L., Ex.R-1 and registration certificate is Ex.R-2 and the vehicle was properly insured vide policy Ex.R-3 and permit is Ex.R-4 and fitness certificate is Ex.R-6. Therefore, all the respondents would be liable to pay the amount of compensation jointly and severally. In view of above discussion, issue no.2 is decided in favour of the petitioners, while issue no.3 is decided against the respondents. ISSUE NO. 4 (RELIEF):- 20)Keeping in view of my detailed discussion on all the aforesaid issues, the petition is allowed with costs. Out of the total amount of Rs.5,04,000/-, the petitioner no.1 would be entitled to a sum of Rs.4 lacs and petitioner no.4 to the remaining amount, apart from Rs.50,000/- for loss of love and affection. The petitioners are also entitled for the interest of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization. Amount of compensation be disbursed in favour of petitioners in cash against proper receipt and identification. The respondents no.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation. Jagjit Singh, MACT . Mahinder Singh etc . Vs . Gajanand etc 11 Memo of costs be prepared accordingly and file be consigned to record room after due compliance.

It is further averred that, as the said accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of canter bearing registration no.HR-24-A- 5394 by respondent no.1; therefore, the respondent no.1 being driver, the respondent no.2 being owner and the respondent no.3 being insurer of the vehicle in question are liable jointly and severally to pay compensation to the petitioners. 4The claim petitions have been contested by respondents.

It is further averred that as the driver of canter bearing registration no.HR-24-A-5394 was not having a valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident and as the same was being driven in violation of terms and conditions of insurance policy; therefore, the replying respondent is not liable to pay compensation.

SMT.SARIKA VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & SANDEEP KUMAR VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & PARKASH CHAND & ANOTHER VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS -10- 10On the other hand, Vijay Kumar, the respondent no.1 has examined himself as RW1; tendered copy of his driving licence as Ex.RW1/B bearing no.HR-3719990020153 dated 07.05.1999, Tr. valid upto 04.12.2017; non-Tr. valid upto 04.02.2019, issued by licensing authority, Ambala, authorizing to drive M.C. with gear/LMV-NT-Car, LMV-Transport, TRV Rigid Chassi only and thereafter, learned counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 closed evidence vide statement dated 17.03.2016.Learned counsel for respondent no.3 after tendering insurance policy as Ex.R3, valid from 27.09.2014 to 26.09.2015 closed its evidence vide statement dated 22.03.2016. 11I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the case file and attending circumstances carefully. My issue-wise findings are as under:- Issue No. 1 12To prove this issue, Sandeep Kumar, PW6, the claimant/petitioner (in MACP no.384) has deposed by way of affidavit as Ex.PW6/A tendered in his examination-in-chief reiterating contents of the petition. During cross-examination, he has deposed that motorcycle was being driven by Sanjeev @ Sanju (since deceased). He has further deposed that he alongwith one Subham were pillion riders on the said motorcycle. He has admitted that three persons were sitting on the motorcycle. He has denied that due to over-loading on motorcycle, SMT.SARIKA VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & SANDEEP KUMAR VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & PARKASH CHAND & ANOTHER VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS -11- Sanjeev Kumar @ Sanju (since deceased) could not control and the accident in question took place. He has further denied that tanker bearing registration no.HR-24-A-5394 has been involved falsely in the present case to get compensation. Vikram Singh, PW3 has deposed that Sanju @ Sanjeev son of Parkash alongwith his friends namely Sandeep son of Ishwar and Hunny @ Subham son of Babli were going to Wajidpur from Bihta village on motorcycle bearing registration no.HR- 01-N-3345 and when they reached near Sabga-Naraingarh Majra chowk, Shahbad road at 11.30 a.m. a canter of milk bearing registration no.HR- 24-A-5394 being driven by Vijay Kumar son of Raghu Nandan Lal, the respondent no.1, rashly and negligently came and struck against the motorcycle, as a result thereof, Sanjeev Kumar @ Sanju suffered serious injuries. He has further deposed that he was behind them and after the accident, took Sanjeev Kumar to nearby hospital from where he was referred to PGI and on 16.02.2015 succumbed to the injuries. He has further deposed that he had lodged FIR against the driver of canter. During cross-examination, he has deposed that he was on his own motorcycle bearing registration no.HR-54-B-2421. He has denied that he did not witness the accident. Vijay Kumar, RW1, the respondent no.1 has deposed by way of affidavit as Ex.RW1/A tendered in his examination-in- chief. He has deposed that he was driving canter bearing registration no.HR-24-A-5394 at a very slow speed by observing all traffic rules. He SMT.SARIKA VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & SANDEEP KUMAR VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & PARKASH CHAND & ANOTHER VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS -12- has further deposed that accident in question had taken place on account of rash and negligent driving of motorcycle by Sanjeev Kumar (since deceased), who had suddenly come on wrong side of the road and hit against the canter, being driven by him. During cross-examination, he has admitted that a criminal under Section 279 IPC is pending in the court of learned JMIC, Ambala and is fixed for evidence. Learned counsels for the petitioners has urged that, factum of registration of FIR no.16 dated 12.02.2015, under Sections 279/337 IPC with Police Station Saha, District Ambala, as Ex.P5, coupled with admission of Vijay Kumar, RW1, the respondent no.1 regarding pendency of criminal case against him under Section 279 IPC in the court of learned JMIC, Ambala, are sufficient to arrive at the conclusion that, the accident in question causing death of Sanjeev Kumar @ Sanju and injuries to Sandeep Kumar, the claimant/petitioner (in MACP no.384) had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of Canter/tanker bearing registration no.HR-24-A- 5394 by Vijay Kumar, the respondent no.1. In Gurdeep Kaur Versus Tarsem Singh 2008(2) RCR (Civil) 775, it is held by Hon' ble Punjab and Haryana High Court that “if the driver is being tried on account of rash and negligent driving in a criminal case in a court of law, it is prima facie safe to hold that the accident occurred on account of his rash and negligent act. It is further held that in a claim petition under Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 the evidence should not be scrutinized in the manner as SMT.SARIKA VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & SANDEEP KUMAR VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & PARKASH CHAND & ANOTHER VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS -13- is done in a civil or in a criminal case. The proceedings before the Tribunal are of the nature of summary enquiry, whereas in a criminal case the rule is of proof beyond reasonable doubt and in a civil case the rule is of preponderance of probabilities. If there is some evidence before the claim Tribunal to prove a fact, no nicety, doubt or suspicion should weigh with it, in deciding a Motor Accident Claim case” . It is further held that “Tribunal established under the Motor Vehicle Act, are not governed by the rules of procedure envisaged by the Civil Procedure Code and Tribunals are required to evolve their own procedure to meet the ends of justice, based on the principles of justice, equity and good conscience”. It is also held in Bimla Devi Versus Himachal Road Transport Corpn. and others AIR 2009 SC 2819 that “it is not possible to give strict proof of accident by the claimants and they have to establish their case merely on touchstone of preponderance of probability” . The death of Sanjeev Kumar @ Sanju stands proved form postmortem examination report as marked-P3; the injuries suffered by Sandeep Kumar, the claimant/petitioner (in MACP no.384) stand proved from treatment record as Ex.P8 of M.M. Medical College & Hospital, Mullana; case summary as Ex.P9 of PGI, Chandigarh, placed on record. Learned counsel for respondent no.3 has contended that as three persons were riding on motorcycle bearing registration no.HR-01-N-3345 being driven by Sanjeev Kumar @ Sanju (since deceased) and thus have SMT.SARIKA VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & SANDEEP KUMAR VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & PARKASH CHAND & ANOTHER VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS -14- contributed towards the accident; however, said contention of learned counsel for respondent no.3 is liable to be rejected for the reasons that there is no evidence on record to establish that they were driving the motorcycle in question rashly and negligently and even if, three persons were riding/sitting on said motorcycle, the same is an offence only under the Motor Vehicles Act,1988, but that itself, in the opinion of this Tribunal, may not lead to a finding of negligence as regards the accident and they cannot be held liable for contributing towards the accident in question. Though, Vijay Kumar, RW1, the respondent no.1 has deposed that accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of motorcycle by Sanjeev Kumar @ Sanju (since deceased) himself; but there is nothing on record to substantiate the same; accordingly, only because three persons were riding/sitting on motorcycle, this fact alone would not lead to a conclusion that they were also guilty of contributory negligence. 13In view of the above discussion, it is proved that, Sanjeev Kumar @ Sanju had died due to injuries sustained in the accident in question and Sandeep Kumar, the claimant/petitioner (in MACP no.384) had suffered injuries in the said motor vehicular accident that had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of canter/tanker bearing registration no.HR-24-A-5394 by the respondent no.1. Consequently, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners and against the SMT.SARIKA VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & SANDEEP KUMAR VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & PARKASH CHAND & ANOTHER VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS -15- respondents. Issue no.2 14To ascertain the amount of compensation payable to Smt.Sarika, the claimant/petitioner (in MACP no.106) and Parkash Chand and Satya Devi, the claimants/petitioners (in MACP no.385) regarding death of Sanjeev Kumar @ Sanju (since deceased), both said petitions are being taken up together. 15To prove this issue, Sarika, PW1, the claimant/petitioner (in MACP no.106) has deposed by way of affidavit, as Ex.PW1/A tendered in her examination-in-chief, reiterating contents of the petition. During cross-examination, she has deposed that they had performed love marriage in Bihta in a temple. Maan Singh, PW2 has deposed that Sarika, the claimant/petitioner(in MACP no.106) is his niece; was married to Sanjeev Kumar @ Sanju (since deceased) on 06.08.2012 who met with a road side accident on 12.02.2015 and died in PGI on 16.09.2015 due to injuries sustained in the said accident. He has further deposed that San - jeev Kumar @ Sanju(since deceased) was 24 years of age at the time of accident. During cross-examination, he has deposed that marriage of Sarika had taken place at village Shahzadpur which was attended by him and other family members. Nirmala, PW4, the Assistant in the office of District Welfare Officer, Ambala, has deposed that as per record, they had SMT.SARIKA VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & SANDEEP KUMAR VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & PARKASH CHAND & ANOTHER VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS -16- given a sum of Rs.31,000/- to Kamla Devi wife of Manga Ram, resident of Shahzadpur, Tehsil Naraingarh, District Ambala, under BPL no.129 for marriage of Sarika with Sanjeev Kumar son of Om Parkash, resident of village Bihta, Police Station Saha, District Ambala, who is the daughter of Kamla Devi. During cross-examination, she has deposed that as per record, the age of Sanjeev Kumar is mentioned as 20 years and date of marriage is mentioned as 13.04.2014. She has further deposed that there is no such record whether the marriage was performed or not, but volun - teered that report was given only after due verification. She has denied that no marriage of Sarika with Sanjeev Kumar had taken place. Gaurav Bindra, PW5, the Deputy Manager of HDFC Bank, Nicholson Road, Am - bala Cantt., has proved statement of account of Mrs.Sarika Kumar as Ex.PW5/A. He has deposed that as per record, husband's name is men - tioned as Sanjeev Kumar as nominee, the proof of which he has not brought. Parkash Chand, PW7, the claimant/petitioner no.1 (in MACP no.385) has deposed that Sarika, proforma respondent no.4 was widow of Sanjeev Kumar (since deceased) who has left the house since the date of his death without any reason and has remarried to Sunny son of Roshan, resident of village Jeolly, Tehsil Naraingarh, District Ambala. Ram Par - tap, PW8 has also deposed that Sunny is married to Sarika daughter of Manga Ram in January 2016, which was her second marriage, as she was previously married to Sanjeev Kumar, resident of Bihta. Parkash Chand SMT.SARIKA VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & SANDEEP KUMAR VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & PARKASH CHAND & ANOTHER VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS -17- and Satya Devi, the claimants/petitioners (in MACP no.385), the parents of Sanjeev Kumar(since deceased) have made Sarika as proforma respon - dent no.4 being widow of Sanjeev Kumar @ Sanju (since deceased); meaning thereby, it stands admitted that she was married to their son namely Sanjeev Kumar @ Sanju (since deceased) which fact was denied in statement as Ex.R1; however, there is lack of documentary evidence on record to prove remarriage of Sarika with Sunny son of Roshan Lal. It is has come in evidence that Sanjeev Kumar @ Sanju (since deceased) used to earn by installing fast-food stall; though, Parkash Chand, PW7 has claimed income of Sanjeev Kumar @ Sanju (since deceased) to be Rs.20,000/- per month, but in the absence of cogent evidence, same ap - pears to be on higher side; hence, by approximation, his monthly income is taken as Rs.6,000/-. As Sanjeev Kumar @ Sanju (since deceased) was married having wife and old aged parents to maintain; therefore, he must not be spending more than 1/3rd of his income towards his own personal and living expenses and remaining 2/3rd must be con- tributing towards his family. Reference can be made to Sarla Verma and others Versus Delhi Transport Corporation and another 2009 ACJ 1298 SC. Thus, annual dependency comes to Rs.4,000/- x 12 = 48,000/-. He was 24 years of age at the time of his death in the aforesaid accident, as is evident from his postmortem examination report as marked-P3; hence in this case the suitable multiplier will be of 18. SMT.SARIKA VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & SANDEEP KUMAR VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & PARKASH CHAND & ANOTHER VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS -18- Thus, on calculating compensation on its basis, it comes to Rs. 48,000 x 18 = Rs. 8,64,000/-. Further, a sum of of Rs.20,000/- on account of loss of consortium is awarded as compensation to Sarika, the claimant/petitioner (in MACP no.106); a sum of Rs.20,000/- on account of transportation, funeral and last rites expenses of the deceased is awarded as compensation to Parkash Chand and Satya Devi, the claimants/petitioners (in MACP no.385). It is pertinent to mention here that, immediately after the accident, Sanjeev Kumar @ Sanju (since deceased) was initially shifted to MM Medical College & Hospital, Mullana, from where he was referred to PGI, Chandigarh; remained ad - mitted there w.e.f. 12.02.2015 to 16.02.2015 and took treatment for the injuries suffered by him in the accident in question and a total sum of Rs.5250/- was spent on his treatment, lab tests etc. in the aforesaid hospital, as is evident from medical bills/receipts as Ex.P22 to as Ex.25, as Ex.P27 to as Ex.P32 placed on record. This amount is also allowed to the petitioners (in MACP no.385) as compensation for medical expenses incurred during the treatment of Sanjeev Kumar @ Sanju (since deceased) prior to his death. R eference can also be made to Smt. Parsanni Versus Shri Sube Singh and another 2011(2) PLR 764 (P&H), wherein it is held that “production of the bills relating to the purchase of medicines during the period of hospitalization and oral evi - dence given by the party about purchasing of medicines ought to be taken SMT.SARIKA VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & SANDEEP KUMAR VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & PARKASH CHAND & ANOTHER VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS -19- as sufficient proof of authentication and admissibility of these documents”. It is further held that “a hospital document produced by a party which is duly authenticated must be taken as sufficient as proof of the documents themselves and the requirement to produce the doctor for mere production of hospital documents must be immediately given up”. Case No.MACP/384/2015 titled as “Sandeep Kumar Versus Vijay Kumar and others” 16To ascertain the amount of compensation payable to Sandeep Kumar, the claimant/petitioner(in MACP no.384), discussion is being made under following heads:- Medical expenses 17To prove this issue, Sandeep Kumar, the petitioner(in MACP no.384) has deposed by way of affidavit as Ex.PW6/A tendered in his examination in-chief-reiterating contents of the petition. During cross- examination, he has deposed that after the accident, he was taken to MM Medical College and Hospital, Mullana; however, due to serious injuries was referred to PGI, Chandigarh, where he remained from 12.02.2015 to 14.02.2015. Though, he has deposed that he has spent Rs.2.50 lac on his treatment, rich diet, transportation and on attendant charges etc., but in the absence of cogent evidence, same appears to be on higher side. During cross-examination, he has deposed that treatment at PGI was free of SMT.SARIKA VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & SANDEEP KUMAR VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & PARKASH CHAND & ANOTHER VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS -20- costs, but has further deposed that he had purchased medicines from the market. He has placed on record documents as Ex.P6 to as Ex.P18, as Ex.P26, evidencing treatment obtained from MM Medical College & Hospital, Mullana, PGI, Chandigarh and expenses incurred to the tune of Rs.8518/- on his treatment. Some bills might have not been taken in haste in a bid to provide quick medical treatment or the same might have been lost in managing the patient more than in caring for the details such as collection and retention of the bills. Taking into account, such natural and usual lapse as also human failing, the medical expenses are taken to be Rs.9,000/-. This amount is allowed as compensation for medical expenses. Pain and Sufferings 18 Sandeep Kumar, the injured/claimant (in MACP no.385) had remained admitted in PGI, Chandigarh from 12.02.2015 to 14.02.2015 as is evident from case summary as Ex.P9 and OPD card as Ex.P10. He had suffered multiple injuries including fracture. Though, he has deposed that he was student of 10th class at the time of accident and was unable to pursue his studies further for one year due to the injuries suffered in the accident in question, but there is no cogent evidence on record in this regard. There is also no cogent evidence on record that due to injuries suffered in the accident, he may not be able to able to join the police, armed forces and his matrimonial prospects have also bleaked. The SMT.SARIKA VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & SANDEEP KUMAR VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & PARKASH CHAND & ANOTHER VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS -21- provisions of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, make it clear that, the award must be just, which means that compensation should, to the extent possible, fully and adequately restore the claimant to the position prior to the accident. The object of awarding damages is to make good the loss suffered as a result of wrong done as far as money can do so, in a fair, reasonable and equitable manner. Thus, the compensation should be reasonably sufficient so that it equips the victim to return to his normal life to the maximum possible extent. It was a time of travail and trauma. The petitioner must have been confined to bed for sufficiently long time and life would not have been the same for him. Hence, by approximation a sum of Rs.10,000/- is awarded as compensation to Sandeep Kumar, the claimant/petitioner(in MACP no.384) under this head. Reference can be made to Sri Laxman @ Laxman Mourya Versus Divisional Manager, Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. & another 2012(1) TAC 376 (SC), wherein, it has been held that “ efforts should always be made to award adequate compensation, not only for the physical injury and treatment, but also for pain, suffering and trauma caused due to accident ”. Nutritious Diet 19 Sandeep Kumar, the injured had suffered multiple injuries, so nutritious diet was required for early healing of the same. Three months time is taken to be sufficient to come in routine for the injured. SMT.SARIKA VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & SANDEEP KUMAR VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & PARKASH CHAND & ANOTHER VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS -22- Taking charges for nutritious diet to be Rs.2000/- per month, a sum of Rs.6,000/- is awarded as compensation to the injured claimant under this head. Attendant Charges 20The claimant/injured Sandeep Kumar remained admitted in PGI, Chandigarh, from 12.02.2015 to 14.02.2015 . He had suffered multiple injuries including fracture. At least three months time was required to the injured to come in routine. Even if, he was helped by his family members, such support has commercial value. Taking attendant charges to be Rs.2000/- per month, a sum of Rs.6,000/- is allowed as compensation to the claimant under this head. Transportation Charges 21The claimant/injured Sandeep Kumar is a resident of Village Bihta, Tehsil Barara, District Ambala. After the accident he remained admitted in PGI, Chandigarh and also must have got follow up treatment from the said hospital. He has placed on record receipt as Ex.P19, evidencing expenditure to the tune of Rs.2,000/- incurred during transportation. This amount of Rs.2000/- is awarded to him under this head. 22Compensation allowed to Sandeep Kumar, the claimant/petitioner (in MACP no.384), put in a tabular form is given as below:- SMT.SARIKA VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & SANDEEP KUMAR VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS & PARKASH CHAND & ANOTHER VERSUS VIJAY KUMAR AND OTHERS -23- Sr. No.Nature Amount in Rupees 1.Medical Expenses 09,000-00 2.Pain and sufferings 10,000-00 3.Nutritious diet 06,000-00 4.Attendant Charges 06,000-00 5.Transportation Charges 02,000-00 ____________________________________________________ Total Rs. 33,000-00 Hence, issue no.2 is decided accordingly. Issue no. 3. 23Onus to prove this issue was on the insurance company, respondent no.3; however, respondent no.3 did not lead any evidence to show that vehicle in question i.e. Canter bearing registration no.HR-24- A-5394 was being driven in violation of terms and conditions of insurance policy, as Ex.R3, valid from 27.09.2014 to 26.09.2015; hence, respondent no.3 has failed to discharge its onus.

J U D G E M E N T: This claim petition under Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act for grant of compensation on account of injuries sustained in a Motor vehicle accident, has been filed by the claimant. 2)Brief facts of the claim petition are that on 11.08.2011, the claimant boarded a private bus No.HR-37C-1932 from Barara for Ambala, which was being driven by respondent no.4. At about 10.15 A.M., when the said bus reached in the area of village Tepla, on Ambala- Jagadhri Road, near Maruti Agency, a Canter bearing registration No.RJ- 13-GA-1461 being driven rashly and negligently and at a very high speed by the respondent no.1 came from opposite side and firstly hit a motorcycle going ahead of the bus of the claimant and then hit his Canter into the bus, as a result of which the bus went off the road and hit against the Safeda tree. The claimant suffered injuries on his head, face, mouth, nose, right hand and right wrist. Several other passenger of the bus also sustained injuries. The claimant was got admitted in Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt but due to serious injuries, the claimant was referred to PGI, Chandigarh. The claimant had spent more than Rs.3,00,000/- on his Jagjit Singh, MACT Balbir Singh Vs. Ram Singh etc. 3 treatment, special diet etc. Matter was reported to the police and FIR was got registered against the respondent no.1. Lastly, it was prayed that compensation amount to the tune of Rs. 20,00,000/- be awarded to her on account of injuries sustained by her along with interest @ 18% per annum, from the date of filing of the petition till its realization, for which respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation. 3)The respondent no.2 did not appear despite service and accordingly he was was proceeded exparte vide order dated 06.11.2015, whereas petition qua respondents no.1 and 4 was dismissed vide order dated 19.01.2016. 4)Respondent No.3 Insurance Company contested the petition by filing separate written statement and it was submitted that driver of the offending vehicle/respondent No.1 was not having valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident and insured willfully violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. The factum of accident as alleged by the claimant in the petition was denied and submitted that a false and manipulated FIR has been registered against respondent No.1 in collusion with the police. Also, the factum of rash and negligence of the offending vehicle was denied. Remaining contents of the petition were denied and prayer to dismiss the petition was made. Jagjit Singh, MACT Balbir Singh Vs. Ram Singh etc. 4 5)Replication was not filed. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed :- 1.Whether the accident resulting into injuries to the claimant took place on account of rash and negligent driving of Canter bearing registration No.RJ-12GA- 1461 by respondent no.1 or due to the rash and negligent driving of respondent no.4 while driving bus bearing registration No.HR-37C-1932, as alleged? OPP 2.If issue No.1 is proved, then to what amount of compensation, claimant is entitled to and from whom? OPP. 3.Whether the insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation, in view of the preliminary objections raised in the written statement and whether there has been a breach of terms and conditions of the policy of insurance? OPR-3 4.Relief. 6) In support of his case, claimant himself appeared in the witness box as PW-1 and also examined Dr. Vikas Paul as PW-2. Besides oral evidence, the following documents were placed on record:- Ex.P-1 :Ration Card Ex.P-2 :PAN Card Ex.P-3 & P-4 :FIR Ex.P-5 :Copy of Judgment Ex.P-6 :Treatment Card Jagjit Singh, MACT Balbir Singh Vs. Ram Singh etc. 5 Ex.P-7 :Disability Certificate Ex.P-8 to P-16 :Medicines bills Mark-A :Copy of Treatment Record Mark-B to Z &:Medicines Bills Mark A1 to A14 Thereafter, ld. Counsel for the petitioner closed the evidence. 7)On the other hand, the respondent no.3 has not led any evidence. 8)No evidence in rebuttal was led by the petitioner. 9)I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the material placed on record. My issue-wise finding are given as under:- ISSUE No.1:- 10)The onus of proving this issue was on the petitioner and to prove the same, learned counsel for the petitioner argued that on 11.08.2011 the petitioner boarded a private bus No.HR-37C-1932 for Ambala and it was being driven by respondent no.4. At about 10:15 A.M. when the bus reached in the area of village Tepla, a Canter bearing No.RJ- 13-GA-1461 driven in a rash and negligent manner by respondent no.1 came and hit the Canter in a motorcycle and then the bus in question, as a result of which the bus went off the road and hit trees on the side of the Jagjit Singh, MACT Balbir Singh Vs. Ram Singh etc. 6 road. The petitioner suffered serious injuries in the said accident and the respondent no.1 fled from the spot. The FIR was got registered on the same day by Gurjant Singh and the FIR, Ex.P-1 mentions the number of the offending vehicle and respondent no.1 is facing trial for the said accident. That no rebuttal on the part of the respondents has come in this regard, whereas the petitioner deposed and proved his averments mentioned in the petition. 11)Learned counsel for the respondents meanwhile argued that a false claim petition has been filed by the petitioner and no such accident ever took place and she is not entitled to any compensation. 12)I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the documents on file. 13)FIR, Ex.P-1, mentions the manner in which the accident took place and it also mentions the number of the offending vehicle being driven by the respondent no.1. Even otherwise, it is observed by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Smt. Surinder Kaur and others Versus Lakhbir Singh and another 2007(1) PLR 494 that; “F.I.R.-Being a public document is admissible in evidence as such and if no objection is raised at the time of production thereof, the same is Jagjit Singh, MACT Balbir Singh Vs. Ram Singh etc. 7 to be read in evidence.” Similar view was held by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Bansi Yadav and another Versus Krishan Kumar and another 2004(3) ACC 758. Keeping in view the principle laid down in authorities (Supra), it becomes clear that the FIR being a public document and when not rebutted is to be considered as true. It is also important to note that the proceedings in MACT cases are of summary nature and the case is not to be proved like civil case where case is to be proved from the point of preponderance of probabilities or in criminal case, where charge is to be proved beyond shadows of doubt. The FIR has been registered against the respondent no.1. So, in view of law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993(2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008(2) R.C.R. (civil) 774, it can be safely held that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of Canter bearing No.RJ-13GA-1461. by respondent no.1. Accordingly, issue no.1 is decided in favour of the petitioner. ISSUES No.2 and 3: 14)The onus of proving issue no.2 was on the petitioner while onus of proving issue no.3 was on the respondent no.3. Finding of one Jagjit Singh, MACT Balbir Singh Vs. Ram Singh etc. 8 issue shall have bearing on the other and hence the same are being decided together. 15)To prove the above issue, learned counsel for the petitioner argued that in the accident in question the petitioner suffered serious injuries and also disability of 45% which has been deposed by the doctor, PW-2 and apart from this, the petitioner spent an amount of Rs.3,20,000/- on his treatment and therefore, is entitled to compensation accordingly. 16)Learned counsel for respondent no.3 meanwhile argued that no specific proof of any amount spent on treatment has come on record. 17)I have heard the learned counsels for the parties and have perused the documents on file. 18)The witness, PW-2, has deposed regarding the disability of 45% suffered by the petitioner as a result of injuries in the accident and the petitioner has placed on file his medical bills, although not proved by any doctor but it is seen that the petitioner would have spent some amount on his treatment with the kind of injuries suffered by him, therefore, he becomes entitled to the following amount of compensation. For 45% permanent disability Rs.90,000/­ For pain and suffering, diet and nutrition, attendant charges etc.Rs.30,000/­ TOTAL Rs.1,20,000/­ Jagjit Singh, MACT Balbir Singh Vs. Ram Singh etc. 9 Apart from this, t he petitioner also becomes entitled to interest @ 7.5.% per annum on compensation amount from the date of filing of the petition till the date of actual realization. 19)With regard to respondents liable to pay the amount of compensation, it is seen that the respondent no.3 does not dispute the offending vehicle having been insured with them and neither does he dispute the competency of respondent no.1 to drive the vehicle since earlier a similar petition of the said accident was decided vide judgment, Ex.P-5 and as a result all the respondents would be jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation. In view of above discussion, issue no.2 is decided in favour of the petitioner, while issue no.3 is decided against the respondent No.3. ISSUE NO. 5(RELIEF):- 20)Keeping in view of my detailed discussion on all the aforesaid issues, present petition is allowed with costs and a total compensation amount of Rs.1,20,000/- is awarded to the petitioner along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization and respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation . On realization of the compensation amount, the same be Jagjit Singh, MACT Balbir Singh Vs. Ram Singh etc. 10 disbursed in favour of claimant in cash against proper receipt and identification. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly and file be consigned to record room after due compliance.

In this claim petition, while providing necessary particulars as required under the Motor Vehicles Act and the Rules thereunder, the petitioner inter-alia averred that on 22.6.2015 around 5.00 P.M., she alongwith her husband Devinder was going from village Samalkha to village Bagwali on motorcycle no.HR03L/9886 and when they reached near Ghee Factory on Saha-Shahzadpur Road, Canter bearing registration no.PB11AR/9649 being driven rashly and negligently in zigzag manner by respondent no.1 came from opposite site i.e. Shahzadpur side and struck against their motorcycle, being driven by her husband at normal speed on correct left side of the road. It is further averred that as a result thereof, they alongwith the motorcycle fell down on road and received multiple and grievous injuries on various parts. It is further averred that accident was witnessed by Jaspal resident of Bihta. It is further averred that she and her husband were shifted to Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt. in an Ambulance, where they remained SHIVANI VERSUS HARMESH KUMAR & OTHERS 4 admitted from 22.06.2015 to 23.06.2015 and due to seriousness of injuries, both were referred to PGI on 23.6.2015, but both got themselves admitted in C. Lall Hospital, Ambala Cantt. and remained admitted there from 23.06.2015 to 02.07.2015 and that they are still under follow-up. It is further averred that she spent about Rs.5 lacs on her treatment, medicines and hospitalization and that much more amount is yet to be spent, she being still under follow up. It is further averred that due to injuries sustained in the accident, she has become disabled and is unable to walk without help and to perform her work efficiently and that she has suffered loss of income. It is further averred that she had got married about four months ago and got deprived of enjoyment of her married life. It is further averred that accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of Canter no.PB11AR/9649 by respondent no.1, so respondent no.1 being Driver, respondent no.2 being owner and respondent no.3 being insurer, of vehicle in question, are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation. It is prayed that an Award of Rs.15,00,000/- alongwith interest at the rate of 18% per annum from the date of accident, till realization be passed in favour of petitioner. 3.In MACP No.226 of 2015 titled as Devinder Kumar versus Harmesh Kumar and others , compensation has been claimed on account of injuries sustained by petitioner Devinder Kumar. Other than necessary particulars about the accident, it has been specifically averred in the SHIVANI VERSUS HARMESH KUMAR & OTHERS 5 petition that petitioner Devinder Kumar is about 25 years of age and he spent around Rs.3 lac on his treatment, medicines and hospitalization and that much more amount is yet to be spent, he being still under follow-up. It is further averred that due to injuries sustained in the accident, he has become disabled and is unable to perform his work efficiently and that he has suffered loss of income.

In this claim petition, compensation to the tune of Rs.10 lac alongwith interest at the rate of 18% per annum from the date of accident, till realization has been claimed. 4.On notice, respondents no.1 and 2 appeared and filed joint written statement in main claim petition titled Shivani versus Harmesh Kumar and others taking preliminary objections qua maintainability, locus standi, concealment and collusion. On merits, it is averred that a false story has been concocted by manipulating facts and that no such accident had occurred. It is further submitted that no FIR was lodged against respondent no.1 on 22.6.2015 and alleged FIR was lodged by police without verifying facts. It is further submitted that if it is concluded that accident had taken place with vehicle in question, in that eventuality, respondent no.3 being insurer is liable to pay compensation, if any. Denying all other averments, dismissal of petition was prayed for. 5.On notice, insurance company i.e. respondent no.3 appeared and filed written statement taking preliminary objections qua cause of SHIVANI VERSUS HARMESH KUMAR & OTHERS 6 action, maintainability, mis-joinder and non-joinder of parties, collusion, respondent no.1 not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident. It is further submitted that as per mandatory provision laid down in Section 158 (6) of the Act, immediately on receipt of information qua death/bodily injury to any person in an accident, the Investigating Officer shall forward a copy thereof to Claims Tribunal, insurer and owner and the owner is further required to intimate about the same to Claims Tribunal within thirty days. Denying all other averments, dismissal of petition was prayed for. 6.In connected petition, separate written statements have been filed. The stand of respondents in these claim petitions is same regarding the accident and liability as taken by them in claim petition no. 225 of 2015 titled as Shivani versus Harmesh Kumar and others . 7.Replication was not filed. Both claim petitions were consolidated vide Order dated 29.1.2016 and from pleadings of parties, following issues were framed: 1.Whether the accident in question took place by rash and negligent driving of Canter bearing registration No.PB11AR/9649 by respondent No.1 Harmesh Kumar resulting into injuries to Shivani and Devinder Kumar as alleged? OPP 2.If issue No.1 is proved, then whether claimants are entitled to compensation, if so how much and from whom? OPP. 3.Whether respondent no.1 was driving offending vehicle in violation of terms and conditions of insurance policy, if so SHIVANI VERSUS HARMESH KUMAR & OTHERS 7 its effect? OPR (3) 4.Relief 8. In order to prove the case, claimant Devinder Kumar himself stepped as PW-1, whereas claimant Shivani stepped as PW2 and also examined PW3 Dr. K.K. Gandotra. In documentary evidence, documents Ex.P12, Ex.P13 and Mark-A to Mark-F were tendered. 9.On the other hand, no oral evidence was led on behalf of respondents. After tendering in evidence documents Ex.RA to Ex.RD, ld. counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 closed the evidence, whereas after tendering document Ex.RE, ld. counsel for respondent no.3 also closed the evidence. 10.In rebuttal, document Ex.P14 was tendered. 11.I have heard learned counsel for parties and have gone through material pleadings, evidence and the legal proposition applicable to the present case. My findings on above issues are as under: Issue No.1: 12.Burden to prove this issue was upon petitioners/ claimants. Claimant Devinder Singh appeared as PW-1 and filed his affidavit Ex.PW1/A, wherein he specifically deposed that accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving Canter bearing registration no.PB11AR/9649 in a rash and negligent manner. PW-2 Shivani filed her affidavit Ex.PW-2/A wherein she also deposed on the same lines and deposed that respondent no.1 caused the accident while driving Canter bearing registration no.PB11AR/9649 in a rash and negligent manner. Both SHIVANI VERSUS HARMESH KUMAR & OTHERS 8 were cross examined at length, but there is nothing on record to disbelieve their version. 13.Immediately after the accident, FIR No.83 dated 23.6.2015 was registered in Police Station Saha, District Ambala for commission of offences punishable u/Ss. 279, 337, 338 IPC. The number of Canter is specifically mentioned in the FIR. After investigation of the case, final report u/S 173 Cr.P.C Ex.P1 was presented in the Court. R espondent no.1 was the best witness, but for the reasons best known to him, he failed to appear as witness to controvert the allegations levelled against him that he was driving Canter bearing registration No.PB11AR/9649 in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. In such a situation, when respondent no.1/driver is facing criminal trial for having caused the accident, it is safe to presume that it was due to his negligence that the accident occurred. Reference may be made to authority reported as Girdhari Lal Versus Radhey Shyam, 1997 (2) PLR 109 (P&H ). When the version of accident is supported by statement of eye witnesses, finding of rash and negligent driving by the driver of the offending vehicle would be justified. Reference may be made to Ram Parkash and another Versus Kantra Suri and others, 1986 ACJ 471 (P&H ). 14.Considering the above facts, this Tribunal is of the view that the petitioners have successfully proved that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving Canter bearing registration no.PB11AR- 9649 in a rash and negligent manner. Hence, this issue is decided in favour of petitioners. SHIVANI VERSUS HARMESH KUMAR & OTHERS 9 Issue no.2 & 3: MACP No.225 of 2015 Shivani Vs. Harmesh and Ors. etc. 15.This claim petition has been filed by the petitioner claiming compensation on account of injuries sustained by her in the vehicular accident. She appeared as PW2 and filed her affidavit Ex.PW2/A, wherein she deposed that immediately after the accident she was taken to Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt, where she remained admitted on 22.6.2015 and 23.6.2015. She further deposed that considering nature of injuries, she was referred to PGI, Chandigarh, but was taken to C. Lall Hospital, Ambala Cantt. She deposed that she remained admitted from 23.6.2015 to 2.7.2015 and she was operated upon. She deposed that she spent more than Rs.5.00 lacs on her treatment, transportation, hospitalization, special diet etc. She deposed that she was 23 years of age at the time of accident and was earning more than Rs.10,000/- per month from stitching works etc. 16.In order to prove her hospitalization and treatment, Dr. K.K. Gandotra has been examined as PW-3. He deposed that Shivani was admitted in his hospital on 23.6.2015 and was discharged on 2.7.2015. He deposed that she was having both bones of both legs fractured and was operated upon and surgery was done. He deposed that he charged Rs.40,000/- from Shivani on account of operation, hospitalization and investigations. He proved Bill Ex.P2. It is clear from bill Ex.P2 that Shivani had paid Rs.40,000/- in C. Lall Hospital. Accordingly, it is held that petitioner is entitled to get Rs.40,000/- under the head of SHIVANI VERSUS HARMESH KUMAR & OTHERS 10 hospitalization and treatment charges. 17.In support of her claim regarding amount spent on her treatment charges, petitioner placed on record receipt Ex.P3 showing that she paid Rs.5,000/- as anesthesia charges. PW-3 Dr. Gandotra has also deposed that Rs.5000/- was charged vide Ex.P3. Accordingly, Rs.5000/- is also awarded in favour of petitioner. In view of facts of the case, Rs.20,000/- as shown in bill Ex.P4, is also awarded in favour of petitioner on account of amount spent on purchase of interlocking nails etc. 18.Considering the facts of the case and nature of injuries suffered by petitioner, it is held that petitioner is also entitled to get Rs.11,636/- (as shown in Ex.P5 to Ex.P11) under the head of treatment expenses. Accordingly, Rs.11,636/- is awarded in favour of the petitioner under the head of medical expenses. 19.It is clear from disability certificate Ex.P14 that petitioner suffered permanent disability to the extent of 10%. Ex.P14 is original copy of the disability certificate issued by Medical Board of four Medical Officers including Civil Surgeon, Ambala. There is no reason to disbelieve the contents of Ex.P14. Accordingly, Rs.20,000/- (Rs.2000/- per percent disability) is awarded in favour of petitioner under the head of permanent disability. 20.In addition to the amount awarded above, considering the nature of injuries suffered by the petitioner and hospitalization period, Rs.5,000/- is awarded under the head of attendant charges, Rs.5,000/- is awarded under the head of special diet, Rs. 10,000/- under the head of pain SHIVANI VERSUS HARMESH KUMAR & OTHERS 11 and suffering and Rs.10,000/- is awarded under the head of loss of income. 21.In total, Rs.1,26,636/- is awarded as compensation in favour of petitioner.

He appeared as PW1 and filed his affidavit Ex.PW1/A, wherein he deposed that immediately after the accident he was taken to Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt, where he remained admitted on 22.6.2015 and 23.6.2015, he further deposed that considering nature of injuries, he was referred to PGI, Chandigarh, but he was taken to C. Lall Hospital, Ambala Cantt. He deposed that he remained admitted from 23.6.2015 to 2.7.2015 and he was operated upon. He deposed that he spent more than Rs.5.00 lacs on his treatment, transportation, hospitalization, special diet etc. He deposed that he was 25 years of age at the time of accident and was earning more than Rs.15,000/- per month by selling fruits. 23.In order to prove his hospitalization and treatment from C. Lall Hospital, no evidence has been led. PW3 Dr. K.K. Gandotra, C. Lall Hospital has deposed about hospitalization and treatment of Shivani wife of Devinder Kumar and not about petitioner/Devinder. Although he had deposed about hospitalization from 22.6.2015 to 2.7.2015, but no document has been placed on record to show his hospitalization. As discussed above, PW3 has also not deposed about his hospitalization. So SHIVANI VERSUS HARMESH KUMAR & OTHERS 12 the version of the petitioner regarding hospitalization and spending of Rs.3.00 lacs on his treatment is not believable. It is clear from the record that petitioner has not produced any record to prove that he remained admitted in C. Lall Hospital from 23.6.2015 to 2.7.2015. 24.PW1 deposed regarding receiving of injuries by him in vehicular accident. Considering the facts of case, there is no reason to disbelieve the amount shown in Ex.P12, as paid by petitioner in C. Lall Hospital. Accordingly, Rs.2400/- is awarded in favour of petitioner under the head of medical expenses. 25.It is clear from the disability certificate Ex.P13 that petitioner suffered permanent disability to the extent of 3%. Ex.P13 is original copy of the disability certificate issued by Medical Board of Three Medical Officers including Civil Surgeon, Ambala. There is no reason to disbelieve the contents of Ex.P13. Accordingly, Rs.6,000/- (Rs.2000/- per percent disability) is awarded in favour of the petitioner under the head of permanent disability. In addition to the amount awarded above, Rs.10,000/- is awarded under the head of special diet, pain suffering etc. 26.In total, Rs.18,400/- is awarded as compensation in favour of petitioner. 27.Admittedly, Canter bearing registration no.PB-11AR-9649 was insured with respondent no.3 vide Policy Ex.RE. Burden to prove Issue no.3 was upon respondent no.3/Insurance Company, but no evidence has been led on this issue. Hence, Issue no.3 is decided against respondent no.3. Accordingly, it is held that all the respondents shall be jointly and SHIVANI VERSUS HARMESH KUMAR & OTHERS 13 severally liable to pay the compensation, awarded in favour of petitioners. Relief 28.In view of the above discussion and findings on the issues, both claim petitions are partly allowed with cost. In MACP No.225 of 2015 titled as Shivani versus Harmesh Kumar and others, Rs.1,26,636/- is awarded in favour of petitioner. The petitioner is entitled to get interest at the rate of 7½% per annum on the awarded compensation from the date of filing of the present petition till realization of awarded amount. 29.In MACP No.226 of 2015 titled as Devinder Kumar versus Harmesh Kumar and others, Rs.18,400/- is awarded in favour of petitioner. The petitioner is entitled to get interest at the rate of 7½% per annum on the awarded compensation from the date of filing of the present petition till realization of awarded amount. 30.The respondents shall deposit the amount awarded in favour of petitioners by way of cheque or demand draft in their names. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.2200/- in each case. Memo of costs be prepared separately in each case. Copy of this Award be placed in connected petition. Files be consigned to record room after due compliance.

State of Haryana etc. 2 This claim petition under Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act for grant of compensation on account of injuries sustained in a Motor vehicle accident, has been filed by the claimant. 2)Brief facts of the claim petition are that on 09.03.2011, the claimant was coming back to her house at Sadhaura from her college. At about 3:00 P.M. a bus bearing registration No.HR-65-0987 of Haryana Roadways, Kurukshetra came at the stop of D-Sarka Mullana from Barara side and passengers alighted from the said bus and some passengers boarded the said bus. When the claimant was in the process of boarding the said bus from the front door, the driver of the bus without waiting for the whistle of the Conductor and without ascertaining whether all the passengers intended to board the bus, suddenly rashly and negligently put the bus at once in gear and driven the same at a very high speed. Due to heavy jerk of the bus the claimant fell down from the front door of the bus and she was run over the left side wheels of the bus and received multiple grievous injuries including fracture of hip. The complainant was taken to M.M. Medical College & Hospital, Mullana and thereafter, the claimant was referred to PGI, Chandigarh but the doctors of PGI refused to admitted the claimant and hence, the claimant was taken to Fortis Hospital, Mohalli, where the claimant remained admitted till 10.02.2011. Jagjit Singh, MACT Meenakshi Vs. State of Haryana etc. 3 Thereafter, the claimant remained admitted in Safdarjang Hospital, Delhi from 10.02.2011 to 30.03.2011. The claimant has spent more than Rs.8 lacs on her treatment etc. Matter was reported to the police and FIR was got registered against the respondent no.1. Lastly, it was prayed that compensation amount to the tune of Rs. 70,00,000/- be awarded to h er on account of injuries sustained by h er along with interest @ 18% per annum, from the date of filing of the petition till its realization, for which respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation. 3)The respondents No.1 and 2 being owners of the offending bus filed joint written statement and denied the averments made in the petition and stated that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent act of the claimant herself. All other material averments were denied and lastly prayed for dismissal of the petition. 4)The respondent no.3 being driven of the offending bus filed separate written statement and it was pleaded that no accident took place due to his rash and negligent driving and the claimant had managed to lodge a false FIR against the respondent. 4)Respondent No.3 Insurance Company contested the petition by filing separate joint written statement and it was submitted that driver of the offending vehicle/respondent No.1 was not having valid and Jagjit Singh, MACT Meenakshi Vs. State of Haryana etc. 4 effective driving license at the time of alleged accident and insured willfully violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. The factum of accident as alleged by the claimants in the petition was denied and submitted that a false FIR has been registered against respondent No.1 in collusion with the police. Also, the factum of rash and negligence of the offending vehicle was denied. Remaining contents of the petition were denied and prayer to dismiss the petition was made. 5)Replication was not filed. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed :- 1.Whether the accident in question causing injuries to the claimant Meenakshi took place due to rash and negligent driving of bus bearing registration No.HR- 65-0987 by its driver-respondent no.3, as alleged? OPP 2.If issue No.1 is proved, then to what amount of compensation, claimant is entitled to and from whom? OPP. 3.Whether the insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation, in view of the preliminary objections raised in the written statement and whether there has been a breach of terms and conditions of the policy of insurance? OPR-4 4.Relief 6) In support of her case, claimant herself appeared in the witness box as PW-1 and also examined Dr. Sankalp Dwivedi as PW-2, Jagjit Singh, MACT Meenakshi Vs. State of Haryana etc. 5 Dr. Rakesh Kain as PW-3, Dr. J. Sikandar as PW-4. Besides oral evidence, the following documents were placed on record:- Ex.P-1 & P-2 :Educational Certificates Ex.PW-2/A to D :Discharge Cards Ex.PW-2/E :Final Bill Ex.P-3 & P-4 :Educational Certificates Ex.PW-4/A :Discharge Card Ex.PW-4/A & B :Bills PW-5 to P-12 :Educational Certificates Ex.P-13 :Discharge Summary Ex.P-14 :FIR Ex.P-15 :Report u/s 173 Cr.P.C.

State of Haryana etc. 6 Ex.P-91 :Disability Certificate Ex.P-92 :Treatment Record Thereafter, ld. Counsel for the petitioner closed the evidence. 7)On the other hand, the respondents have examined Ashwani Kumar as RW-1 and tendered the following documents: Ex.R-1 :Copy of D.L. Ex.R-2 :Insurance Policy Ex.R-3 :Copy of R.C. Ex.R-4 :Fitness Certificate Ex.R-5 :Permit Ex.R-6 :Copy of D.L. 8)No evidence in rebuttal was led by the petitioner. 9)I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the material placed on record. My issue-wise finding are given as under:- ISSUE No.1:- 10)The onus of proving this issue was on the petitioner and to prove the same, learned counsel for the petitioner argued that in the present case an accident took place on 03.02.2011 and FIR was got registered by Hitender Kumar, brother of the injured and the FIR is Ex.P- 14, which mentions number of the offending bus driven by the respondent Jagjit Singh, MACT Meenakshi Vs. State of Haryana etc. 7 no.3 and it also mentions the name of the offending driver as Ashwani Kumar, who faced trial for the said accident and which is also deposed in the witness box by the injured herself and there is no dispute by the respondents. Even the driver appearing as respondents' witness has not disputed the causing of the accident. 11)Learned counsel for the respondent no.4 meanwhile argued that a false claim petition has been filed by the petitioner and no such accident ever took place. 12)I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the file carefully. 13)FIR, Ex.P-14 mentions the manner in which the accident was caused and it also mentions the name of the offending driver, who was respondent no.3 in the present case. He also faced the trial and although stands acquitted, but appearing as a witness for the respondents he also does not deny the accident in question. Even otherwise, it is observed by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Smt. Surinder Kaur and others Versus Lakhbir Singh and another 2007(1) PLR 494 that; “F.I.R.-Being a public document is admissible in evidence as such and if no objection is raised at the time of production thereof, the same is Jagjit Singh, MACT Meenakshi Vs. State of Haryana etc. 8 to be read in evidence.” Similar view was held by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Bansi Yadav and another Versus Krishan Kumar and another 2004(3) ACC 758. Keeping in view the principle laid down in authorities (Supra), it becomes clear that the FIR being a public document and when not rebutted is to be considered as true. It is also important to note that the proceedings in MACT cases are of summary nature and the case is not to be proved like civil case where case is to be proved from the point of preponderance of probabilities or in criminal case, where charge is to be proved beyond shadows of doubt. The FIR has been registered against the respondent no.1. So, in view of law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993(2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008(2) R.C.R. (civil) 774, it can be safely held that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of Bus bearing No.HR-65-0987 by respondent no.2. Accordingly, issue no.1 is decided in favour of the petitioner. ISSUES No.2 and 3: 14)The onus of proving issue no.2 was on the petitioner and onus to prove issue no.3 was on the respondents. Finding of one issue Jagjit Singh, MACT Meenakshi Vs. State of Haryana etc. 9 shall have bearing on the other and hence the same are being decided together. To prove the above issue, learned counsel for the petitioner argued that in the accident in question the petitioner suffered serious injuries and operated upon and also remained admitted in the hospital for several days. That she has spent an amount of Rs.2 lacs on her treatment and also suffered 15% permanent disability. The witness PW-2 deposed about the treatment given by him to the injured and he charged a sum of Rs.16,815/- for the treatment. PW-3 deposed regarding admission of injured in their hospital and skin grafting was done. PW-4 also deposed about the treatment given to the injured and she was referred to PGI, Chandigarh. On the basis of the testimony of these witnesses and bills produced on file learned counsel prayed for granting of compensation to the injured. 15)Learned counsel for respondent no.4 meanwhile argued that in the present case the respondent no.4 is not liable to pay any amount of compensation since the injured herself contributed towards the accident by trying to board an over crowded bus and she fell on her own and the respondent no.4 cannot be held liable in any manner. Jagjit Singh, MACT Meenakshi Vs. State of Haryana etc. 10 In support, reliance was placed upon the principles laid down in Himachal Road Transport Corporation & Anr. Vs. Harbans Kaur & Ors., 2006(3) PLR 501 , where it was held that “ Deceased was trying to board the running bus – conductor could direct the driver to stop the bus immediately – Gate (door) of the bus was visible from the seat of the driver – On seeing the deceased, boarding the bus, the driver himself could stop the same – Negligence of the deceased and the driver of the bus can be apportioned at 30:70 per cent. ” 16)Learned counsel for the petitioner meanwhile rebutted the arguments of the learned counsel for respondent no.4 by placing reliance upon the principles laid down in Dharambir Singh Vs. Shanti Devi & Ors., 1995 ACJ 1178 and Jawlibai & Ors. Vs. Chandrakant & Ors., 2009(4) ACC 753. 17)Learned counsel for respondents No.1 to 3 meanwhile argued that it was respondent no.4 who was liable to pay the amount of compensation since the driver holds a valid D.L., Ex.R-6 and the vehicle was properly insured with the respondent no.4 vide policy Ex.R-2 and the registration certificate being Ex.R-3. 18)I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the file carefully. Jagjit Singh, MACT Meenakshi Vs. State of Haryana etc. 11 19)The respondent no.4 pleaded about contribution of the injured towards the accident and placed reliance upon the principles laid down in Himachal Road Transport Corporation's case (Supra) and almost similar are the circumstances in the present case where the injured- petitioner was trying to board an over crowded bus, as the statement of RW-1 would show that there were about 100-150 passengers including students who had boarded the bus and some passengers were also hanging in the door of the bus. In such circumstances when the petitioner was trying to board the bus it is but natural that there being no further space inside, she could not have easily boarded the same and therefore, fell down and contributed towards the accident, which in the present circumstances can be considered to the extent of 30%. With regard to the amount spent by the petitioner on her treatment, only PW-3 has proved the bill of Rs.16,815/- and no other doctor deposed or proved any bill. However, with the kind of injuries suffered by the petitioner some amount would have been spent by her on her treatment and merely tendering of the bills by the counsel do not prove the same. The petitioner therefore, becomes entitled to following amount of compensation. For 15% permanent disability Rs.30,000/­ For medical bills and treatment Rs.50,000/­ Jagjit Singh, MACT Meenakshi Vs. State of Haryana etc. 12 For pain and sufferings, diet and nutrition, attendant charges and transportation etc.Rs.40,000/­ TOTAL Rs.1,20,000/­ Apart from this, t he petitioner also becomes entitled to interest @ 7.5.% per annum on compensation amount from the date of filing of the petition till the date of actual realization. The petitioner as already discussed contributed to the accident to the extent of 30% and therefore, 30% of this amount would be deducted, which comes to Rs.36,000/­ and the remaining amount is Rs.84,000/­ to which the petitioner becomes entitled to. 20)With regard to respondents liable to pay the amount of compensation, it is seen that the respondent no.3 holds a valid D.L. Ex.R- 6 and the vehicle was properly insured with the respondent no.4 vide policy Ex.R-2 and the registration certificate is Ex.R-3 and thus, all the respondents jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation. Accordingly, issue no.2 is decided in favour of the petitioner and issue no.3 is decided against the respondent no.3. ISSUE NO. 4(RELIEF):- 21)Keeping in view of my detailed discussion on all the aforesaid issues, present petition is allowed with costs and a total Jagjit Singh, MACT Meenakshi Vs. State of Haryana etc. 13 compensation amount of Rs. 84,000/- is awarded to the petitioner along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization and all the respondents no.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation . On realization of the compensation amount, the same be disbursed in favour of claimant in cash against proper receipt and identification. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly and file be consigned to record room after due compliance.

Ex.R-8 :Copy of D.L. Ex.R-9 :Copy of Register Thereafter learned counsel closed the evidence of respondents. 9)No evidence in rebuttal was led by the petitioner. 10)I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the material placed on record. My issue-wise finding are given as under:- ISSUE No.1:- 11)The onus of proving this issue was on the petitioners and to prove the same, learned counsel for the petitioners argued that in the Jagjit Singh, MACT Sarita etc. Vs. Surinder etc. 6 present case on 27.09.2014 Narinder Bhandari alongwith his father Rajinder Bhandari was going on motorcycle driven by Narinder Bhandari, PW-3. At about 10.30 A.M. while going from Tangri to Rama Petrol Pump, the respondent no.1 came driving his tractor-trolley in a rash and negligent manner and struck against the motorcycle, as a result of which the motorcycle got entangled and Rajinder Bhandari suffered serious injuries and he was taken to the hospital, where as a result of the injuries he died. FIR in the present case was got registered, which is Ex.P-3 on the same day by Narinder Bhandari and the FIR mentions the description of the tractor-trolley as Sonalika DI750 of Blue colour and the respondent no.1 was facing trial for the said offence as per charge sheet, Ex.P-4, and the report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. was Ex.P-5. It was argued that as a result the evidence makes it amply clear regarding death of Rajinder Bhandari having taken place by the rash and negligent driving of his tractor by respondent no.1. 12)Learned counsel for the respondents meanwhile argued that no such accident ever took place due to any rash or negligent driving of respondent no.1 and a false claim petition has been filed by the petitioners. 13)I have heard the counsels for the parties and perused the file carefully. 14)Perusal of FIR shows the manner in which the accident took Jagjit Singh, MACT Sarita etc. Vs. Surinder etc. 7 place and it also mentions about the involvement of tractor without number plate, Marka Sonalika DI750 of Blue Colour. FIR has also been registered on the very same day of the accident and the respondent no.1 was facing trial for the said offence. Nothing contrary to this could be brought on record by the respondents. Even otherwise, it is observed by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Smt. Surinder Kaur and others Versus Lakhbir Singh and another 2007(1) PLR 494 that; “F.I.R.-Being a public document is admissible in evidence as such and if no objection is raised at the time of production thereof, the same is to be read in evidence.” Similar view was held by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Bansi Yadav and another Versus Krishan Kumar and another 2004(3) ACC 758. Keeping in view the principle laid down in authorities (Supra), it becomes clear that the FIR being a public document and when not rebutted is to be considered as true. It is also important to note that the proceedings in MACT cases are of summary nature and the case is not to be proved like civil case where case is to be proved from the point of preponderance of probabilities or in criminal case, where charge is to be proved beyond shadows of doubt. The FIR has been registered against the respondent no.1. So, in view of law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Jagjit Singh, MACT Sarita etc. Vs. Surinder etc. 8 Radhay Shyam, 1993(2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008(2) R.C.R. (civil) 774, it can be safely held that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle Tractor-trolley bearing registration No.HR-07N-1221 by respondent no.1. Accordingly, issue no.1 is decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUES No.2 AND 3:- 15)The onus of proving issue no.2 was on the petitioners while onus of proving issue no.3 was upon the respondents. Finding of one issue shall have bearing on the other and hence the same are being decided together. To prove the above issues, learned counsel for the petitioners argued that the deceased has left behind four dependents which includes his widow, two children and his mother and he was working as a Welder and partner in a firm. The income tax returns of the deceased have been brought on record showing his montly income to the extent of Rs.14,000/- per month and the petitioners were accordingly entitled to compensation in the present case. 16)Learned counsel for respondent No.1 meanwhile argued that although no such accident took place by any fault of the respondent no.1 and the respondent no.1 is not liable to pay any compensation. If the Tribunal comes to such conclusion, then the respondent no.1 holds a valid Jagjit Singh, MACT Sarita etc. Vs. Surinder etc. 9 Driving License, Ex.R-8, which entitles him to drive tractor and the registration certificate of the vehicle is Ex.R-7 and it is the respondent no.3 who is liable to pay the amount of compensation. 17)Learned counsel for respondent no.3 meanwhile argued that the respondent no.3 is not liable to pay the amount of compensation in the present case and moreover, the claimant no.2 being major son is not entitled to any compensation. It was argued that no specific proof of income of deceased has come on file and under what capacity the income tax return was filed is not explained and it also does not have any balance sheet. No partnership deed has come on record or any account of the partnership firm and neither any partner was examined to prove about the deceased being a partner in any firm. Learned counsel further pointed out to the testimony of the witnesses examined, where PW-3 has stated that he was looking after the factory these days and his father did not have any Diploma of any trade. He was also not aware whether there was any partnership deed of the firm and neither any partnership deed was executed after the death of this father. He stated that the registration number of the tractor-trolley was told to him by the police and he was not joined in the investigation. That the driver disclosed his name at the time of accident where he was apprehended. Learned counsel also pointed out to the testimony of Jagjit Singh, MACT Sarita etc. Vs. Surinder etc. 10 respondent's witnesses to argue that the respondent no.1 only held Driving License to drive tractor, whereas the vehicle had a trolley fitted and which was loaded with Bajri and therefore, there was commercial use of the tractor and violation of the policy and the respondent no.3 was thus not liable to pay any compensation. It has been stated by RW-1 about the tractor being registered for agricultural purposes and not trolley registered with it. RW-2 proved that the D.L. of respondent no.1 was valid only for tractor and not to drive any goods carrying vehicle or commercial vehicle. In support of his arguments learned counsel placed reliance upon the principles laid down in Narinder Singh Vs. New India Assurance Co. Ltd. & Ors., 2014 ACJ 2421 , where it was held that in case vehicle is plied without registration, the insurance company is not liable. Tractor carrying goods without any permit and insurance company not being liable , for which reliance was placed upon Partap Singh Vs. National Insurance Co. Ltd. & Ors., 2016(2) TAC 166. Similar view was held in Natwar Parikh & Co. Ltd. Vs. State of Karnataka & Ors., 2015(3) ACC 749 . Reliance was also placed upon Mam Chand & Anr. Vs. Sunita Devi & Ors., 2013 ACJ 1332 , where it was held that “ Tractor- trolley used for transporting goods becomes a goods vehicle – Vehicle was loaded with sand and it was being plied on road which requires Jagjit Singh, MACT Sarita etc. Vs. Surinder etc. 11 valid route permit. ” With regard to respondent no.1 was not having valid D.L. to drive the goods vehicle , reliance was placed upon United India Insurance Co Ltd. Vs. Sujata Arora & Ors., 2013 ACJ 2129 . Placing reliance upon the above cited authorities (Supra) it was argued that the respondents no.1 and 2 are liable to pay the amount of compensation in the present case. 18)I have heard the learned counsels for the parties and have perused the case file carefully. 18)In the present case the petition has been filed by four claimants who are widow, two children of deceased and his mother. It is seen that the claimant no.2 is adult son of the deceased and as has been held in Sarla Verma's case, could not be dependent upon the deceased. With regard to the income of the deceased, no proof of income could come on record including any partnership deed or any account being maintained by the firm or any proof of monthly income. The marked documents which are Income Tax Returns without any supporting evidence or any balance sheet cannot be considered to come to any conclusion about the monthly earning of the deceased. 19)It is further seen that it has come in evidence that the tractor being driven by respondent no.1 had trolley attached with Bajri loaded in it and as a result keeping in view the case laws as cited by the learned Jagjit Singh, MACT Sarita etc. Vs. Surinder etc. 12 counsel for respondent no.3 the vehicle becomes a goods carrying vehicle which requires a special permit as it was not being used for agricultural purposes. Moreover, the respondent no.1 was only entitled as per his DL to drive tractor and not a commercial vehicle or goods carrying vehicle. Keeping in view all these aspects, the petitioners no.1, 3 and 4 become entitled to following amount of compensation in the present case. The accident having taken place in the year 2014 even if the deceased is considered as a labourer, he would earn minimum amount of Rs.7000/- per month and considering the fact that he was an income tax payee, he would be earning little more than that, therefore, his monthly income is considered as Rs.10,000/-, which makes annual income as Rs.1,20,000/-. Having left behind three dependents, 1/3rd of this amount is to be deducted towards personal living and expenses of the deceased, which comes to Rs.40,000/- and the balance comes to Rs.80,000/-. The deceased as per PAN Card placed on file was born in the year 1965 and the accident having taken place in the year 2014, he would be 49 years old at the time of accident and multiplier that would be apply in the present case is that of “13” and by applying the same, the amount comes to Rs.10,40,000/-. Apart from this, the petitioners would also be entitled to Rs.25,000/- for performing last rites and the amount comes to Rs.10,65,000/-. The petitioner no.1 would also be entitled to a separate sum of Rs.50,000/- for loss of consortium, whereas petitioners no.3 and 4 Jagjit Singh, MACT Sarita etc. Vs. Surinder etc. 13 would also be entitled to a separate sum of Rs.50,000/- each for loss of love and affection. The petitioners are also entitled to interest @ 7.5.% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization. 20)As already discussed the respondent no.1 was not entitled to drive the vehicle in question and there was violation of the terms and conditions of the policy, it would be the respondents no.1 and 2 who would be liable to pay the amount in compensation but keeping in view the circumstances of the case and the fact that the petitioners cannot be faulted for the negligence of the respondents no.1 and 2 and therefore, all the respondents would be jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation but the respondent no.3 is granted the right of recovery from respondents no.1 and 2. Issue no.2 is therefore, decided in favour of the petitioners and issue no.3 is partly decided in favour of respondent no.3. ISSUE NO. 4 (RELIEF):- 21)Keeping in view of my detailed discussion on all the aforesaid issues, the petition is allowed with costs. Out of the total amount of Rs.10,65,000/-, the petitioner no.1 would be entitled to a sum of Rs.5,65,000/- besides Rs.50,000/- for loss of consortium and the petitioner no.3 would be entitled to a sum of Rs.2,00,000/-, whereas petitioner no.4 would be entitled to a sum of Jagjit Singh, MACT Sarita etc. Vs. Surinder etc. 14 Rs.3,00,000/-, besides Rs.50,000/- each for loss of love and affection. The petitioners are also entitled for the interest of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization. Amount of compensation be disbursed in favour of petitioners no.1, 3 and 4 in cash against proper receipt and identification . The respondents no.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation but respondent no.3 is granted a right of recovery from respondents no.1 and 2. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly and file be consigned to record room after due compliance. Pronounced in open Court (JAGJIT SINGH) Dated: 06.08.2016 Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ambala.

Rajesh Kumar, counsel for respondent no.3. Sh. Mohinder Bindal, counsel for respondent no.4. J U D G E M E N T: Jagjit Singh, MACT Meenakshi Vs. State of Haryana etc. 2 This claim petition under Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act for grant of compensation on account of injuries sustained in a Motor vehicle accident, has been filed by the claimant. 2)Brief facts of the claim petition are that on 09.03.2011, the claimant was coming back to her house at Sadhaura from her college. At about 3:00 P.M. a bus bearing registration No.HR-65-0987 of Haryana Roadways, Kurukshetra came at the stop of D-Sarka Mullana from Barara side and passengers alighted from the said bus and some passengers boarded the said bus. When the claimant was in the process of boarding the said bus from the front door, the driver of the bus without waiting for the whistle of the Conductor and without ascertaining whether all the passengers intended to board the bus, suddenly rashly and negligently put the bus at once in gear and driven the same at a very high speed. Due to heavy jerk of the bus the claimant fell down from the front door of the bus and she was run over the left side wheels of the bus and received multiple grievous injuries including fracture of hip. The complainant was taken to M.M. Medical College & Hospital, Mullana and thereafter, the claimant was referred to PGI, Chandigarh but the doctors of PGI refused to admitted the claimant and hence, the claimant was taken to Fortis Hospital, Mohalli, where the claimant remained admitted till 10.02.2011. Jagjit Singh, MACT Meenakshi Vs. State of Haryana etc. 3 Thereafter, the claimant remained admitted in Safdarjang Hospital, Delhi from 10.02.2011 to 30.03.2011. The claimant has spent more than Rs.8 lacs on her treatment etc. Matter was reported to the police and FIR was got registered against the respondent no.1. Lastly, it was prayed that compensation amount to the tune of Rs. 70,00,000/- be awarded to h er on account of injuries sustained by h er along with interest @ 18% per annum, from the date of filing of the petition till its realization, for which respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation. 3)The respondents No.1 and 2 being owners of the offending bus filed joint written statement and denied the averments made in the petition and stated that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent act of the claimant herself. All other material averments were denied and lastly prayed for dismissal of the petition. 4)The respondent no.3 being driven of the offending bus filed separate written statement and it was pleaded that no accident took place due to his rash and negligent driving and the claimant had managed to lodge a false FIR against the respondent. 4)Respondent No.3 Insurance Company contested the petition by filing separate joint written statement and it was submitted that driver of the offending vehicle/respondent No.1 was not having valid and Jagjit Singh, MACT Meenakshi Vs. State of Haryana etc. 4 effective driving license at the time of alleged accident and insured willfully violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. The factum of accident as alleged by the claimants in the petition was denied and submitted that a false FIR has been registered against respondent No.1 in collusion with the police. Also, the factum of rash and negligence of the offending vehicle was denied. Remaining contents of the petition were denied and prayer to dismiss the petition was made. 5)Replication was not filed. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed :- 1.Whether the accident in question causing injuries to the claimant Meenakshi took place due to rash and negligent driving of bus bearing registration No.HR- 65-0987 by its driver-respondent no.3, as alleged? OPP 2.If issue No.1 is proved, then to what amount of compensation, claimant is entitled to and from whom? OPP. 3.Whether the insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation, in view of the preliminary objections raised in the written statement and whether there has been a breach of terms and conditions of the policy of insurance? OPR-4 4.Relief 6) In support of her case, claimant herself appeared in the witness box as PW-1 and also examined Dr. Sankalp Dwivedi as PW-2, Jagjit Singh, MACT Meenakshi Vs. State of Haryana etc. 5 Dr. Rakesh Kain as PW-3, Dr. J. Sikandar as PW-4. Besides oral evidence, the following documents were placed on record:- Ex.P-1 & P-2 :Educational Certificates Ex.PW-2/A to D :Discharge Cards Ex.PW-2/E :Final Bill Ex.P-3 & P-4 :Educational Certificates Ex.PW-4/A :Discharge Card Ex.PW-4/A & B :Bills PW-5 to P-12 :Educational Certificates Ex.P-13 :Discharge Summary Ex.P-14 :FIR Ex.P-15 :Report u/s 173 Cr.P.C.

State of Haryana etc. 6 Ex.P-91 :Disability Certificate Ex.P-92 :Treatment Record Thereafter, ld. Counsel for the petitioner closed the evidence. 7)On the other hand, the respondents have examined Ashwani Kumar as RW-1 and tendered the following documents: Ex.R-1 :Copy of D.L. Ex.R-2 :Insurance Policy Ex.R-3 :Copy of R.C. Ex.R-4 :Fitness Certificate Ex.R-5 :Permit Ex.R-6 :Copy of D.L. 8)No evidence in rebuttal was led by the petitioner. 9)I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the material placed on record. My issue-wise finding are given as under:- ISSUE No.1:- 10)The onus of proving this issue was on the petitioner and to prove the same, learned counsel for the petitioner argued that in the present case an accident took place on 03.02.2011 and FIR was got registered by Hitender Kumar, brother of the injured and the FIR is Ex.P- 14, which mentions number of the offending bus driven by the respondent Jagjit Singh, MACT Meenakshi Vs. State of Haryana etc. 7 no.3 and it also mentions the name of the offending driver as Ashwani Kumar, who faced trial for the said accident and which is also deposed in the witness box by the injured herself and there is no dispute by the respondents. Even the driver appearing as respondents' witness has not disputed the causing of the accident. 11)Learned counsel for the respondent no.4 meanwhile argued that a false claim petition has been filed by the petitioner and no such accident ever took place. 12)I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the file carefully. 13)FIR, Ex.P-14 mentions the manner in which the accident was caused and it also mentions the name of the offending driver, who was respondent no.3 in the present case. He also faced the trial and although stands acquitted, but appearing as a witness for the respondents he also does not deny the accident in question. Even otherwise, it is observed by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Smt. Surinder Kaur and others Versus Lakhbir Singh and another 2007(1) PLR 494 that; “F.I.R.-Being a public document is admissible in evidence as such and if no objection is raised at the time of production thereof, the same is Jagjit Singh, MACT Meenakshi Vs. State of Haryana etc. 8 to be read in evidence.” Similar view was held by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Bansi Yadav and another Versus Krishan Kumar and another 2004(3) ACC 758. Keeping in view the principle laid down in authorities (Supra), it becomes clear that the FIR being a public document and when not rebutted is to be considered as true. It is also important to note that the proceedings in MACT cases are of summary nature and the case is not to be proved like civil case where case is to be proved from the point of preponderance of probabilities or in criminal case, where charge is to be proved beyond shadows of doubt. The FIR has been registered against the respondent no.1. So, in view of law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993(2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008(2) R.C.R. (civil) 774, it can be safely held that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of Bus bearing No.HR-65-0987 by respondent no.2. Accordingly, issue no.1 is decided in favour of the petitioner. ISSUES No.2 and 3: 14)The onus of proving issue no.2 was on the petitioner and onus to prove issue no.3 was on the respondents. Finding of one issue Jagjit Singh, MACT Meenakshi Vs. State of Haryana etc. 9 shall have bearing on the other and hence the same are being decided together. To prove the above issue, learned counsel for the petitioner argued that in the accident in question the petitioner suffered serious injuries and operated upon and also remained admitted in the hospital for several days. That she has spent an amount of Rs.2 lacs on her treatment and also suffered 15% permanent disability. The witness PW-2 deposed about the treatment given by him to the injured and he charged a sum of Rs.16,815/- for the treatment. PW-3 deposed regarding admission of injured in their hospital and skin grafting was done. PW-4 also deposed about the treatment given to the injured and she was referred to PGI, Chandigarh. On the basis of the testimony of these witnesses and bills produced on file learned counsel prayed for granting of compensation to the injured. 15)Learned counsel for respondent no.4 meanwhile argued that in the present case the respondent no.4 is not liable to pay any amount of compensation since the injured herself contributed towards the accident by trying to board an over crowded bus and she fell on her own and the respondent no.4 cannot be held liable in any manner. Jagjit Singh, MACT Meenakshi Vs. State of Haryana etc. 10 In support, reliance was placed upon the principles laid down in Himachal Road Transport Corporation & Anr. Vs. Harbans Kaur & Ors., 2006(3) PLR 501 , where it was held that “ Deceased was trying to board the running bus – conductor could direct the driver to stop the bus immediately – Gate (door) of the bus was visible from the seat of the driver – On seeing the deceased, boarding the bus, the driver himself could stop the same – Negligence of the deceased and the driver of the bus can be apportioned at 30:70 per cent. ” 16)Learned counsel for the petitioner meanwhile rebutted the arguments of the learned counsel for respondent no.4 by placing reliance upon the principles laid down in Dharambir Singh Vs. Shanti Devi & Ors., 1995 ACJ 1178 and Jawlibai & Ors. Vs. Chandrakant & Ors., 2009(4) ACC 753. 17)Learned counsel for respondents No.1 to 3 meanwhile argued that it was respondent no.4 who was liable to pay the amount of compensation since the driver holds a valid D.L., Ex.R-6 and the vehicle was properly insured with the respondent no.4 vide policy Ex.R-2 and the registration certificate being Ex.R-3. 18)I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the file carefully. Jagjit Singh, MACT Meenakshi Vs. State of Haryana etc. 11 19)The respondent no.4 pleaded about contribution of the injured towards the accident and placed reliance upon the principles laid down in Himachal Road Transport Corporation's case (Supra) and almost similar are the circumstances in the present case where the injured- petitioner was trying to board an over crowded bus, as the statement of RW-1 would show that there were about 100-150 passengers including students who had boarded the bus and some passengers were also hanging in the door of the bus. In such circumstances when the petitioner was trying to board the bus it is but natural that there being no further space inside, she could not have easily boarded the same and therefore, fell down and contributed towards the accident, which in the present circumstances can be considered to the extent of 30%. With regard to the amount spent by the petitioner on her treatment, only PW-3 has proved the bill of Rs.16,815/- and no other doctor deposed or proved any bill. However, with the kind of injuries suffered by the petitioner some amount would have been spent by her on her treatment and merely tendering of the bills by the counsel do not prove the same. The petitioner therefore, becomes entitled to following amount of compensation. For 15% permanent disability Rs.30,000/­ For medical bills and treatment Rs.50,000/­ Jagjit Singh, MACT Meenakshi Vs. State of Haryana etc. 12 For pain and sufferings, diet and nutrition, attendant charges and transportation etc.Rs.40,000/­ TOTAL Rs.1,20,000/­ Apart from this, t he petitioner also becomes entitled to interest @ 7.5.% per annum on compensation amount from the date of filing of the petition till the date of actual realization. The petitioner as already discussed contributed to the accident to the extent of 30% and therefore, 30% of this amount would be deducted, which comes to Rs.36,000/­ and the remaining amount is Rs.84,000/­ to which the petitioner becomes entitled to. 20)With regard to respondents liable to pay the amount of compensation, it is seen that the respondent no.3 holds a valid D.L. Ex.R- 6 and the vehicle was properly insured with the respondent no.4 vide policy Ex.R-2 and the registration certificate is Ex.R-3 and thus, all the respondents jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation. Accordingly, issue no.2 is decided in favour of the petitioner and issue no.3 is decided against the respondent no.3. ISSUE NO. 4(RELIEF):- 21)Keeping in view of my detailed discussion on all the aforesaid issues, present petition is allowed with costs and a total Jagjit Singh, MACT Meenakshi Vs. State of Haryana etc. 13 compensation amount of Rs. 84,000/- is awarded to the petitioner along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization and all the respondents no.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation . On realization of the compensation amount, the same be disbursed in favour of claimant in cash against proper receipt and identification. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly and file be consigned to record room after due compliance.

The body was shifted to General Hospital, Ambala Cantt. and postmortem was conducted on 11.06.2011. It is further averred that accident occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of truck bearing registration No.HP12C/9570 being SARABJIT KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS GANGA RAM & OTHERS 3 driven by respondent no.1. It is further averred that FIR no.175 dated 11.06.2011 was registered against respondent no.1 for commission of offences punishable under Sections 279, 304-A IPC in Police Station Parao, District Ambala, on the statement of Naib Singh regarding this accident. It is further averred that Surjit Singh (now deceased) was 41 years of age at the time of his death and was Supervisor, Frooti Factory, Mohra, District Ambala, thereby earning Rs.8,000/- per month and all claimants were totally dependent upon his income, but due to his untimely death, whole of his family has come on road, there being no male member to look after them. It is further averred that Rs.50,000/- was spent on funeral and last rites of deceased. Claimant no.1 being wife, claimant no.2 being son and claimants no.3 and 4 being parents, of the deceased, claimed compensation to the tune of Rs.20,00,000/- alongwith interest at the rate of 18% per annum from the date of accident till realization. It is prayed that respondent no.1 being driver, respondent no.2 being owner, whereas respondent no.3 being insurer, of vehicle in question, be held liable to pay compensation jointly and severally. 3.On notice, respondent no.1 and 2 appeared and filed joint written statement submitting that Surjit Singh died due to his own negligence as he tried to cross the National Highway, which is very busy road, without waiting for clearance and suffered injuries by skid of his own scooter, but claimants falsely implicated them for causing this SARABJIT KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS GANGA RAM & OTHERS 4 accident, though it was not caused with vehicle of answering respondents. Moreover, Surjit Singh (now deceased) was more than 50 years of age, was uneducated and unemployed and used to work as casual labourer and was not working in factory, as alleged nor was earning Rs.8,000/- per month, as alleged. It is further averred that respondent-driver has already been acquitted in false criminal case got registered by relatives of deceased just to get compensation from respondents and that answering respondents are not liable to pay any compensation to claimants in any manner. However, if any such liability is foisted upon them, the same be ordered to be indemnified by respondent no.3 i.e. insurance company of the vehicle with whom vehicle of answering respondents was legally and validly insured at the time of alleged accident. It is further averred that amount claimed is too excessive and disproportionate to alleged loss caused to claimants. It is further averred that accident in question has not taken place in the manner, as alleged. Denying all other averments, dismissal of claim petition was prayed for. 4.On notice, respondent no.3 appeared and filed written statement raising preliminary objections qua limitation; mis-joinder; cause of action; maintainability and respondent no.1 not having valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident etc. On merits, accident in question is denied. It is averred that alleged driver namely Ganga Ram has been acquitted by the Court of Shri Ravish Kaushik, the then ld. Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Ambala vide Judgment dated 02.09.2015 and now claimants have no right to allege that driver Ganga SARABJIT KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS GANGA RAM & OTHERS 5 Ram was driving his truck in rash and negligent manner. It is further averred that in the FIR, number of the vehicle in question has been shown as HP12/9570, whereas in claim petition, it is HP12C/9570. It is further averred that truck no.HP12C/9570 was never involved in any accident and even otherwise, Insurance Company is not liable to pay any compensation, as truck in question was being driven in violation of terms and conditions of Insurance Policy. It is further averred that amount claim is much more exaggerated and imaginary one. It is further averred that present petition has been filed after due consultation just to get compensation from answering respondent on purely made up basis, which is not sustainable in eyes of law, so answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. Denying all other averments, dismissal of claim petition was prayed for. 5.Replication was not filed. From pleadings of parties, following issues were framed: 1.Whether the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle bearing registration No.HP12C/9570 by respondent no.1 resulting into death of Surjit Singh, as alleged? OPP 2.If issue no.1 is proved, then whether the claimants are entitled to compensation, if so, how much and from whom? OPP 3.Whether the respondent no.1 was driving the offending vehicle in violation of terms and conditions of insurance SARABJIT KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS GANGA RAM & OTHERS 6 policy, if so, its effect? OPR-3 4. Relief 6.In order to prove their case, claimant no.1 Sarabjit Kaur herself stepped as PW1 and examined Naib Singh as PW2. In documentary evidence, documents Ex.P1 to Ex.P3 were tendered. 7.On the other hand, respondents did not lead any oral evidence. However, in documentary evidence, ld. counsel for respondent no.1 and 2 tendered documents Ex.R1 to Ex.R3, whereas ld. counsel for respondent no.3 tendered documents Ex.R4 to Ex.R17. 8.No rebuttal evidence was led. 9.I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the material pleadings, evidence and the legal proposition applicable to the present case. My findings on the above issues are as under:- Issue No.1 10. To prove this issue, ld. counsel for claimants took me to the testimony of PW1 and PW2 and contended that accident in question was caused by respondent no.1 while driving Truck bearing registration No.HP12C/9570 in rash and negligent manner, due to which Surjit Singh died at the spot. 11. On the other hand, ld. counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 submitted that truck in question has been falsely implicated in the case and no such accident was caused by Truck bearing registration No.HP12C/9570 and FIR was registered on the next day, that too, against SARABJIT KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS GANGA RAM & OTHERS 7 vehicle no.HP12/9570 in collusion with police, on the basis of a concocted story just to extract compensation. 12.Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 submitted that mere registration of FIR is not sufficient to conclude that accident was caused by respondent no.1 or he was driving the vehicle in rash and negligent manner. Moreover, driver of offending vehicle i.e. respondent no.1, who was facing criminal case vide FIR no.175 dated 11.6.2011 registered for commission of offences punishable under Sections 279/304-A IPC, has been acquitted in said case by Court of Shri Ravish Kaushik, the then learned Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Ambala vide Judgment dated 02.09.2015. He further submitted that there is delay of one day in registration of FIR. Ld. counsel prayed for dismissal of petition. 13.As per record of the case, accident occurred on 10.06.2011, due to which Surjit Singh died on the spot on account of injuries sustained by him in said accident. Admittedly, PW1 Sarabjit Kaur is not an-eye witness and she has deposed on oath on the basis of hearsay evidence. On the question of rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and involvement of the vehicle, statement of PW2 is relevant. 14.PW2 Naib Singh filed his affidavit Ex.PW2/A in his evidence and deposed that on 10.06.2011, he was standing on the G.T. Road, near Bus Stop, Mohra and at about 9.30 PM, his elder brother namely Surjit Singh reached the turn of Mohra on his scooter bearing registration no.HR01E/2823 and stopped the scooter between the crossing of road and was waiting for clearance of traffic. He further deposed that meanwhile, SARABJIT KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS GANGA RAM & OTHERS 8 truck bearing registration No.HP12C/9570 came from Shahbad side being driven by its driver i.e. respondent no.1 in rash and negligent manner, without observing traffic rules and struck against scooter of his brother, resultantly his brother suffered multiple and grievous injuries and died on the spot. He further testified that driver/respondent no.1 stopped his truck on the spot and thereafter ran away, whereas he noted down number of offending truck on the spot. He further deposed that thereafter, police of P.S. Parao reached there, shifted the body to Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt, whereas his statement was recorded on the spot and FIR no.175 was retested against driver of offending truck. 15.In order to rebut the claim of claimants, respondents have not led any oral evidence. However, they have placed reliance upon documents Ex.R1 to Ex.R17. 16.As per record, FIR No.175 dated 11.6.2011 was registered in PS Parao District Ambala for commission of offences punishable u/Ss.279, 304-A IPC. After investigation of the case, police filed Challan against respondent no.1 and he was charge sheeted for commission of offences punishable u/Ss.279 and 304-A IPC. 17.In criminal case, Gulzar Singh/father of Naib Singh (complainant), appeared as PW4 and he was declared hostile by ld. PP. He deposed in his cross-examination that police got his signatures on blank papers. Naib Singh (who has appeared as PW2 in present claim petition being eye-witness of the case) appeared in criminal trial as PW6 and his examination-in-chief was recorded and his cross-examination was SARABJIT KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS GANGA RAM & OTHERS 9 deferred. As clear from zimni orders Ex.R7 to Ex.R15, Naib Singh did not appear for his cross-examination even after issuance of bailable warrant and non-bailable warrant by ld. trial Court. Vide Order dated 19.8.2015 Ex.R15, passed by Shri Ravish Kaushik, ld. JMIC, Ambala, prosecution evidence was closed and vide Judgment dated 2.9.2015 Ex.R16, accused Ganga Ram was acquitted by ld. trial Court. 18.In his cross-examination, PW2 Naib Singh, who was complainant in the FIR, admitted that after recording of his examination- in-chief on 29.1.2015, he did not appear for cross-examination in criminal case. In his cross-examination, he admitted that no appeal has been filed by him or any other family member against the acquittal of Ganga Ram in criminal case. 19.It is very strange that in present case, PW2 Naib Singh is supporting the case of claimants being brother of deceased and on the other hand, in the criminal case, he did not appear for cross-examination even after issuance of bailable and non-bailable warrant by ld. Magistrate in criminal trial. It is an admitted fact that Naib Singh had not appeared for cross-examination and so, his examination-in-chief can not be read. Gulzar Singh/father of deceased and Naib Singh, was declared hostile by ld. PP, as he was not supporting the case of prosecution. It is an admitted fact that neither Naib Singh/complainant nor any of the LRs of deceased have filed appeal against Judgment dated 2.9.2015 Ex.R16, vide which Ganga Ram was acquitted of the charges for commission of offences punishable u/Ss.279 and 304-A IPC. SARABJIT KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS GANGA RAM & OTHERS 10 20.Written statement by respondent no.3/Insurance Company was filed on 23.2.2016 and in para no.2 of preliminary objections taken in written statement, specific stand was taken regarding acquittal of accused and so, claimants can not say that they were not aware about acquittal of accused. This claim petition has been filed by claimants on 29.10.2015 and so, the same was filed after acquittal of accused. 21.Although there is delay of only one day in registration of the FIR, but same has not been explained. If Naib Singh had recorded number of the offending vehicle on the same day, ld. counsel for claimants failed to give any satisfactory response as to why number was not disclosed to police. Otherwise also, it is clear from the statement of PW2 that story regarding presence of PW2 near the place of occurrence has been concocted and his version is not probable regarding his presence. 22.Considering the facts, this Tribunal is of the view that the act and conduct of PW2 is nothing, but is a fraud upon the Courts in order to secure compensation by resorting to illegal means. The Judgment in F AO No.55 of 2013 titled as Oriental Insurance Company versus Kamla (decided on 4.3.2016 ), is fully applicable to facts of present case. 23.Admittedly, respondent no.1 was facing trial, but as held in the case of Geeta Devi and others vs. Ravinder Kumar and others, 2014 (11) RCR (Civil) 2090 , mere facing of trial is no ground to hold that accident is an outcome of rash and negligent driving of the vehicle in question in absence of any other evidence. It is admitted fact that in criminal case, respondent no.1 has been acquitted. SARABJIT KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS GANGA RAM & OTHERS 11 24.In view of settled law, only on the basis of the fact that police filed Challan against the accused and he faced trial, it can not be held that he was driving the vehicle in rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. 25.Considering entire record of the case, this Tribunal is of the view that truck in question has been falsely implicated just to extract compensation. Accordingly, Issue no.1 is decided against petitioners. Issue no.2 & 3: 26.In view of findings recorded under issue no.1, issue no.2 and 3 have become redundant. Relief 27.In view of above discussion, present claim petition is dismissed with costs. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.2200/-. Memo of costs be prepared. File be consigned to record room.

J U D G E M E N T: This claim petition under Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act for grant of compensation to the tune of Rs. 50,00,000/- on account of death of Jiwach Sahni @ Jivachhi Sahni son of Sh. Vidhi Sahni in a Motor vehicle accident has been filed by the petitioners. 2)Brief facts of the claim petition are that on 25.05.2015 the deceased Jiwach Sahni @ Jivachhi Sahni son of Sh. Vidhi Sahni alongwith his brother was going from his house towards Shudhh Vaishno Punjabi Dhaba, Village Farouli, Distt. Ambala for joining his duty. At about 10:15 P.M. when they reached in front of bus stand, Mohra, they crossed the road and reached in service lane of Ambala to Delhi G.T. Road, in the meantime a Hyundai I-10 car bearing registration No.DL- 8CL-6250 came from Ambala Cantt side and the car was being driven by respondent no.1 in a rash and negligent manner and at a high speed and hit the deceased. As a result of this accident the deceased the deceased got up high in the air and fell on the front glass of the offending car and suffered multiple grievous injuries. The deceased was taken to Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt but the doctors declared him as brought dead. Matter was reported to the police and FIR was got registered against the respondent no.1. Lastly, it was prayed that compensation amount to the tune of Rs.50,00,000/- be awarded to them on account of death of Jagjit Singh, MACT . Pinki Devi etc . Vs & . Amit Sharma Anr 3 deceased Jiwach Sahni @ Jivachhi Sahni son of Sh. Vidhi Sahni along with interest @ 18% per annum, from the date of filing of the petition till its realization, for which respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation. 3)The respondent No.1 being driver and owner of the offending truck filed written statement and denied the averments made in the petition and stated that no accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1, however, a false and frivolous FIR was registered against the respondent no.1 just to fetch the claim. All other material averments were denied and lastly prayed for dismissal of the petition. 4)Respondent No.2 Insurance Company contested the petition by filing separate joint written statement and it was submitted that driver of the offending vehicle/respondent No.1 was not having valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident and insured willfully violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. The factum of accident as alleged by the claimants in the petition was denied and submitted that a false FIR has been registered against respondent No.1 in collusion with the police. Also, the factum of rash and negligence of the offending vehicle was denied. Remaining contents of the petition were denied and prayer to dismiss the petition was made. 5)Replication was not filed. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed :- Jagjit Singh, MACT . Pinki Devi etc . Vs & . Amit Sharma Anr 4 1.Whether the accident in question causing death of Jiwach Sahni @ Jivachhi Sahni took place due to rash and negligent driving of Hyundai I-10 bearing registration No.DL-8CL-6250 by respondent no.1, as alleged? OPP. 2.If issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation the petitioners are entitled to and from whom? OPP. 3.Whether the insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation, in view of the preliminary objections raised in the written statement and whether there has been a breach of terms and conditions of the policy of insurance? OPR-2 4.Relief. 6) In support of their case, claimant no.1 herself appeared in the witness box as PW-1 and also examined Shyam Lal as PW-2, Jevan Sahni as PW-3. Besides oral evidence, the following documents were placed on record:- Ex.P-1 :FIR Ex.P-2 :Post-mortem report Ex.P-3 :Charge sheet Ex.P-4 :Report u/s 173 Cr.P.C. Ex.P-5 :Recovery Memo Ex.P-6 :Ration Card Ex.P-7 :Insurance Policy Thereafter, ld. Counsel for the petitioners closed the evidence. Jagjit Singh, MACT . Pinki Devi etc . Vs & . Amit Sharma Anr 5 7)On the other hand, the respondents have tendered the following documents:- Ex.R-1 :Copy of Insurance Policy Ex.R-2 :Copy of R.C. Ex.R-3 :Copy of D.L. Thereafter learned counsel closed the evidence of respondents. 8)No evidence in rebuttal was led by the petitioner. 9)I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the material placed on record. My issue-wise finding are given as under:- ISSUE No.1:- 10)The onus of proving this issue was on the petitioners and to prove the same, learned counsel for the petitioners argued that in the present case Jiwach Sahni, husband of petitioner no.1 Pinki devi on 25.05.2015 was going alongwith Jevan Sahni and at about 10:15 P.M. near bus stand Mohra, a Hyundai I-10 car bearing registration No.DL- 8CL-6250 came from Ambala Cantt side driven by respondent no.1 in a rash and negligent manner and struck against Jiwach Sahni, who received serious injuries and respondent no.1 stopped for a while and disclosed his name as Amit Sharma and then fled away from the spot. Jiwach Sahni died as a result of injuries suffered and FIR, Ex.P-1 was got registered by PW-3, which mentions the number of the offending vehicle as also the name of the offending driver and this was also deposed in the witness box by PW-3 and no rebuttal to this has come on the part of the respondents. Jagjit Singh, MACT . Pinki Devi etc . Vs & . Amit Sharma Anr 6 11)Learned counsel for the respondents meanwhile argued that no such accident ever took place and a false claim petition has been filed by the petitioners. 12)I have heard the counsels for the parties and perused the file carefully. 13)FIR, Ex.P-1 mentions the manner in which the accident was caused and it also mentions the name of respondent no.1 as the offending driver and the registration number of the vehicle driven by him. Scribe of the FIR deposed as PW-3 and no rebuttal to this has come on the part of the respondents. Even otherwise, it is observed by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Smt. Surinder Kaur and others Versus Lakhbir Singh and another 2007(1) PLR 494 that; “F.I.R.-Being a public document is admissible in evidence as such and if no objection is raised at the time of production thereof, the same is to be read in evidence.” Similar view was held by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Bansi Yadav and another Versus Krishan Kumar and another 2004(3) ACC 758. Keeping in view the principle laid down in authorities (Supra), it becomes clear that the FIR being a public document and when not rebutted is to be considered as true. It is also important to note that the proceedings in MACT cases are of summary nature and the case is not to Jagjit Singh, MACT . Pinki Devi etc . Vs & . Amit Sharma Anr 7 be proved like civil case where case is to be proved from the point of preponderance of probabilities or in criminal case, where charge is to be proved beyond shadows of doubt. The FIR has been registered against the respondent no.1. So, in view of law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993(2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008(2) R.C.R. (civil) 774, it can be safely held that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle car bearing registration No.DL-8CL-6250 by respondent no.1. Accordingly, issue no.1 is decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUES No.2 AND 3:- 14)The onus of proving issue no.2 was on the petitioners while onus of proving issue no.3 was upon the respondents. Finding of one issue shall have bearing on the other and hence the same are being decided together. To prove the above issues, learned counsel for the petitioners argued that the deceased was 29 years old and working in a Dhaba and earning substantial amount as deposed by his widow PW-1 and his brother PW-3. The petitioner no.1 is the widow and petitioner no.2 is daughter of the deceased while petitioner no.3 is mother of the deceased, petitioners no.4 & 6 are brothers and petitioner no.5 is sister of the deceased, who were dependent upon him. The petitioners are therefore, entitled to compensation in the present case. Jagjit Singh, MACT . Pinki Devi etc . Vs & . Amit Sharma Anr 8 15)Learned counsel for respondent no.1 meanwhile argued that although no accident was caused due to any fault of respondent No.1, still if the Tribunal comes to such conclusion, then the respondent no.1 holds a valid Driving Licence, Ex.R-3, registration certificate of the vehcile driven by him is Ex.R-2, insurance policy is Ex.R-3 and it is the respondent no.2, who is liable to pay the amount of compensation. 16) Learned counsel for respondent no.2 meanwhile argued that no proof of income of the deceased has come on record and petitioners no.4, 5 and 6 cannot be said to be dependents of the deceased and petitioner no.4 is himself working in a Dhaba, while petitioners no.5 and 6 are living in their village and not dependent upon the deceased and petitioners no.1 to 3 are only entitled to compensation in the present case. 17)I have heard the learned counsels for the parties and have perused the case file carefully. 18)Six petitioners have filed the present petition on the death of Jiwach Sahni, who was husband of petitioner no.1, father of petitioner no.2, son of petitioner no.3 and brother of petitioners no.4 to 6. The petitioners no.4 to 6 cannot be said to be dependent upon the deceased since petitioner no.4 is brother and himself working in a Dhaba and petitioners no.5 and 6 are living in their village in Bihar while the deceased was working at Ambala and they cannot be said to be dependent upon him in any manner. This only leaves petitioners no.1 to 3 in the present case. Jagjit Singh, MACT . Pinki Devi etc . Vs & . Amit Sharma Anr 9 With regard to the income of the deceased, although the petitioners claim a high income of the deceased but no specific proof has come on record. PW-2, who claims that the deceased was working with him and he paid him Rs.12,000/- failed to bring any record regarding said payment or even having registered the Dhaba or any Sales Tax number or any appointment letter or proof of salary or proof of paying income tax,and therefore, this evidence cannot be considered. It is however, seen that the deceased at the time of his death as per his postmortem report was about 26 years old but it is stated by the widow of the deceased that her husband was 29 years old at the time of his death. Having died in the year 2015 even if the deceased worked as a labourer he could atleast earn an amount of Rs.7500/- per month and considering the said amount as monthly income the deceased would earn Rs.90,000/- per annum. Having three dependents 1/3rd of this amount would be deducted towards the personal living and expenses of the deceased, which comes to Rs.30,000/- and balance comes to Rs.60,000/-. The deceased being 29 years old at the time of his death, the multiplier of '17' would apply in the present case and by applying the same, the amount comes to Rs.10,20,000/-. Apart from this the petitioners no.2 & 3 would also be entitled to a separate amount of Rs.50,000/- each for loss of love and affection and petitioner no.1 would be entitled to Rs.50,000/- for loss of consortium. The petitioners no.1 to 3 are also entitled to interest @ 7.5.% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization. Jagjit Singh, MACT . Pinki Devi etc . Vs & . Amit Sharma Anr 10 19)With regard to the liability of the respondents to pay the amount of compensation, it is seen that the respondent no.1 holds a valid D.L., Ex.R-3 and registration certificate is Ex.R-2 and the vehicle was properly insured vide policy Ex.R-1. Therefore, all the respondents would be liable to pay the amount of compensation jointly and severally. In view of above discussion, issue no.2 is decided in favour of the petitioners, while issue no.3 is decided against the respondents. ISSUE NO. 4 (RELIEF):- 20)Keeping in view of my detailed discussion on all the aforesaid issues, the petition is allowed with costs. Out of the total amount of Rs.10,02,000/-, the petitioner no.1 would be entitled to a sum of Rs.6,20,000/-, petitioner no.2 and 3 are entitled to a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- each, apart from Rs.50,000/- each for loss of love and affection of petitioners no.2 and 3 and loss of consortium of petitioner no.1. The petitioners are also entitled for the interest of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization. Amount of compensation be disbursed in favour of petitioners No.1 and 3 in cash against proper receipt and identification, while the amount of petitioner No.2 be deposited in some nationalized bank till attaining the age of majority by her. The bank will not advance any loan or create any charge against the FDR without the prior permission of the Tribunal. The respondents no.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of Jagjit Singh, MACT . Pinki Devi etc . Vs & . Amit Sharma Anr 11 compensation. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly and file be consigned to record room after due compliance. Pronounced in open Court (JAGJIT SINGH) Dated: 04.05.2016 Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ambala.

Besides this ld. counsel for the petitioner also relied upon documents EX.P1 to EX.P3 and Mark-A to Mark-C. 8.On the other hand, respondents have relied upon documents EX.R1 to EX.R9. 9.I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the record. My issue wise findings are as under: ISSUE NO.1: 10. In order to prove the negligence, claimant/injured examined himself as PW1, wherein he reiterated the contents of claim petition and specifically stated that on 17.01.2015, he was going on his bicycle to attend his duty as security guard and when he reached near Naya Gaon, then one truck bearing Registration No. HP-12A-8222 came from behind being driven by respondent no.1 in a rash and negligent manner and struck his bicycle from behind, due to which, he fell down and received several injuries on his person. PW2 Balkar Singh, the eye witness and son of PW1 has corroborated the statement of PW1 regarding negligen ce driving of respondent no.1. He also stated that he admitted his father to the hospital by Ambulance. Both these witnesses have been cross- examined at length by counsel for respondents, but nothing fruitful came Purushottam Kumar, MACT, Ambala/25.05.2017. UID No.HR0489 Malkiat Singh Versus Hardeep Singh etc. :: 6 :: out from it and their testimonies remained unrebutted and impeach ablet. From their evidence, petitioner has proved that respondent no.1 was negligent in driving his truck and caused accident due to his sole rash and negligent driving. 11. The oral version of PW1 and PW2 is further corroborated by registration of FIR on the statement of injured Malkit Singh against respondent no.1 which is placed on record as Mark-A. Though, the said FIR was registered after a delay of about eleven days, but the said delay has been duly explained in the FIR itself, wherein, the claimant/injured has stated that his statement was recorded after a delay of eleven days as he was unconscious during the said period after the accident , therefore, delay has been satisfactory explained by the claimant/injured. It has been held in 1993(2) PLR 109 Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Sham and others that where the driver of the offending vehicle is facing trial for causing an accident by way of rash and negligent driving, it is safe to hold that accident took place due to his rash and negligent driving. It further found corroboration from treatment record EX.P1, which also show that he received several injuries on his person. 12.There is also no evidence on the file that respondent no. 1 ever filed any protest petition before higher authorities against false implication or against false involvement of the vehicle and their silence for such a long period also goes against them. The only irresistible conclusion that can be drawn is that the accident in question took place Purushottam Kumar, MACT, Ambala/25.05.2017. UID No.HR0489 Malkiat Singh Versus Hardeep Singh etc. :: 7 :: due to rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent no. 1 while driving the offending vehicle. In holding so, I have relied upon 2008(2) RCR Civil 72 Sudama Devi Vs. Kewal Ram . 13. In view of the above discussion and the fact that respondent no. 1 is facing trial for causing the accident by way of his rash and negligent driving this tribunal is of the view that the petitioner suffered injuries due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 1 while driving offending vehicle. Hence this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners accordingly. ISSUE NO.2: 14. Onus to prove this issue is upon the petitioner. To prove the injuries suffered by him, petitioner has examined PW3 Dr. Rahul Kumar (wrongly typed as PW2) , who has deposed that claimant/injured was admitted in the hospital on 17.01.2015. He was suffering jaw injury upper and lower, forearm. He further stated that his jaw injury was operated at two places and was realigned and the patient remained admitted as indoor patient from 17.01.2015 to 31.01.2015 . He further stated that he was discharged in satisfactory condition. The claimant has not filed any bill pertaining to his treatment in the Command Hospital, Chandimandir and during cross-examination, he admitted that his entire treatment including diet was fully free as his son is in Army. The aforesaid evidence proves that the claimant was admitted in the hospital for about 15 days and he was operated twice during his staying in the hospital and even thereafter, Purushottam Kumar, MACT, Ambala/25.05.2017. UID No.HR0489 Malkiat Singh Versus Hardeep Singh etc. :: 8 :: he is still under follow up treatment. Hence, he must have suffered a lot of pain and sufferings. Pain component in such type of injuries and surgery must have been on higher side. Keeping in view the injuries suffered and period of admission in the hospital, petitioner is awarded a sum of Rs.15,000/- towards compensation for pain and sufferings. 15.Claimant during cross-examination has admitted that his entire treatment including diet was fully free as his son is in Army and no bill has been proved on re cord, therefore, he is not entitled to any compensation towards medical expenses. There is nothing on record to show that claimant has become permanent disable, therefore, he is not entitled for any compensation for permanent disability. 16.Keeping in view the treatment and admission in the hospital, he must have spent some amount on transportation and attendant charges, therefore, he is awarded Rs.5,000/- towards compensation for transport and attendant charges etc. As claimant remained admitted in the hospital for fifteen days and completely bed ridden for that period, therefore, a sum of Rs.8000/- is awarded towards loss of enjoyment of life during his admission in the hospital. 17.The claimant was admittedly a retired government servant and is getting Rs.9000/- per month as pension.

However, no proof regarding employment as security guard and selling of milk by the petitioners has been placed on record, therefore, the claimant is not entitled to any compensation on account of loss of any income, as he is only a pensioner. 18.Taking into consideration the evidence on the file, the compensation to be awarded to petitioner under various heads is assessed as under :- 1.For pain and suffering Rs.15,000-00 2.For special diet and transportation Rs 5,000-00 2.For loss of enjoyment of life Rs.8,000-00 Total Rs.28,000-00 19.As a result of above discussion, compensation to be awarded to petitioner comes to Rs.28,000/- alongwith interest @ 7.5% P.A from the date of filing of petition till realization. 20.Now it is to be decided as to who is liable to pay compensation to the petitioner.

The contention of the counsel for respondent no.3 is misconceived since insurance company is relying upon Ex R 6, report received from District Transport Officer, Nagaland under Rigt To Information Act and Ex R7 and EX R8 letters written for such information to prove that respondent no.1 was not holding valid and effective driving license but neither any clerk from licen sing authority, Nagaland nor the person who filed application under RTI Act and who received report of RTO, Nagaland was examined by the insurance company to prove it nor, therefore, report of RTO, Nagaland is not proved in accordance with law and cannot be read in evidence. Moreover, the report of RTO, Nagaland only shows that all licenses other than smart card format are to be treated as cancelled, therefore, license of respondent no.1 was cancelled as per above order. It is nowhere stated that the said driving license of respondent no.1 is fake. The onus to prove that respondent no.1 was not having valid and effective driving license was on respondent no.3/Insurance company but as discussed above it completely failed to discharge the said onus and failed to prove that respondent no.1 was not having valid and effective driving license on the date of accident.

Due to this accident, the petitioner sustained injuries i.e. simple and grievous injuries on his right eye, right forearm, fracture of nasal bone, on the jaw and artificial teeth were broken. Thereafter petitioner was admitted in Command Hospital, Chandimandir. FIR bearing No.10 dated 28.01.2015 u/ss 279 and 337 of IPC Police Station Raipur Rani was registered regarding the accident against respondent no.1. It is further submitted that the accident in question took place solely due to rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent no.1, who being driver, respondent No.2 being the owner and respondent No.3 being insurer of the offending vehicle are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioner.

Petitioner was operated upon and he has spent huge amount on the treatment as well as on transportation, special diet and in engaging an attendant. Petitioner has suffered a lot of pain and sufferings as well as mental agony. Petitioner was drawing pension of Rs.9000/- PM and after retirement, join as Security Guard at Barwala Telephone Exchange and used to earn Rs.7500/- P.M and also running part time Mini Milk Dairy of Buffalos and used to sell 20 kgs of milk daily @ Rs.40/- per kg. On account of the injuries suffered by him, he has become disabled and has suffered loss of income as well. By way of present petition, a sum of Rs.25,00,000/- has been claimed as compensation. 4.Upon notice, none appeared on behalf of respondent no.1, therefore, he was proceeded against ex parte vide order dated 25.01.2017. However, respondent no.2 has contested the petition by filing his written statement. Respondent No.2 in his written statement has refuted the material contents of the petition with regard to time, date, place and manner of accident to be wrong. It is submitted that false case has been got registered against respondent no.1 to grab compensation and the offending vehicle has been falsely implicated. It is also submitted that respondent no. 1 was driver on offending vehicle but he was having a valid and effective driving license. It is also submitted that the vehicle in Purushottam Kumar, MACT, Ambala/25.05.2017.

While denying other averments dismissal of the petition was prayed for. 5.Respondent no.3 in its separate written statement took an identical stand as taken by respondent no.2. It is also submitted that driver of the offending vehicle was not having a valid and effective driving license and as such, the insurance company is not liable to indemnify the owner. The owner also did not give any information in writing to the insurance company regarding the accident and has violated section 134 (c) of the Act. Lastly, it is submitted that huge amount has been claimed as compensation and dismissal of the petition has been sought. 6.Replication was not filed. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed vide order dated 9.3.2016: 1.Whether the accident in question causing the injuries to respondent no.1 while driving truck bearing Registration No.HP-12A-8222 resulting into causing injuries to the claimant Malkit Singh, as alleged?OPP 2.If issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom, the claimant is entitled to?

UID No.HR0489 Malkiat Singh Versus Hardeep Singh etc. :: 5 :: 6.Whether respondent no.3 is entitled to take all the defences available to it under the MV Act? OPR 7.Relief. 7.In order to prove his case, claimant has examined himself as PW1 and also examined Balkar Singh as PW2 and Dr. Rahul Kumar as PW3 (wrongly typed as PW2). Besides this ld. counsel for the petitioner also relied upon documents EX.P1 to EX.P3 and Mark-A to Mark-C. 8.On the other hand, respondents have relied upon documents EX.R1 to EX.R9. 9.I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the record. My issue wise findings are as under: ISSUE NO.1: 10. In order to prove the negligence, claimant/injured examined himself as PW1, wherein he reiterated the contents of claim petition and specifically stated that on 17.01.2015, he was going on his bicycle to attend his duty as security guard and when he reached near Naya Gaon, then one truck bearing Registration No. HP-12A-8222 came from behind being driven by respondent no.1 in a rash and negligent manner and struck his bicycle from behind, due to which, he fell down and received several injuries on his person. PW2 Balkar Singh, the eye witness and son of PW1 has corroborated the statement of PW1 regarding negligen ce driving of respondent no.1. He also stated that he admitted his father to the hospital by Ambulance. Both these witnesses have been cross- examined at length by counsel for respondents, but nothing fruitful came Purushottam Kumar, MACT, Ambala/25.05.2017. UID No.HR0489 Malkiat Singh Versus Hardeep Singh etc. :: 6 :: out from it and their testimonies remained unrebutted and impeach ablet. From their evidence, petitioner has proved that respondent no.1 was negligent in driving his truck and caused accident due to his sole rash and negligent driving. 11. The oral version of PW1 and PW2 is further corroborated by registration of FIR on the statement of injured Malkit Singh against respondent no.1 which is placed on record as Mark-A. Though, the said FIR was registered after a delay of about eleven days, but the said delay has been duly explained in the FIR itself, wherein, the claimant/injured has stated that his statement was recorded after a delay of eleven days as he was unconscious during the said period after the accident , therefore, delay has been satisfactory explained by the claimant/injured. It has been held in 1993(2) PLR 109 Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Sham and others that where the driver of the offending vehicle is facing trial for causing an accident by way of rash and negligent driving, it is safe to hold that accident took place due to his rash and negligent driving. It further found corroboration from treatment record EX.P1, which also show that he received several injuries on his person. 12.There is also no evidence on the file that respondent no. 1 ever filed any protest petition before higher authorities against false implication or against false involvement of the vehicle and their silence for such a long period also goes against them. The only irresistible conclusion that can be drawn is that the accident in question took place Purushottam Kumar, MACT, Ambala/25.05.2017. UID No.HR0489 Malkiat Singh Versus Hardeep Singh etc. :: 7 :: due to rash and negligent driving on the part of respondent no. 1 while driving the offending vehicle. In holding so, I have relied upon 2008(2) RCR Civil 72 Sudama Devi Vs. Kewal Ram . 13. In view of the above discussion and the fact that respondent no. 1 is facing trial for causing the accident by way of his rash and negligent driving this tribunal is of the view that the petitioner suffered injuries due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 1 while driving offending vehicle. Hence this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners accordingly. ISSUE NO.2: 14. Onus to prove this issue is upon the petitioner. To prove the injuries suffered by him, petitioner has examined PW3 Dr. Rahul Kumar (wrongly typed as PW2) , who has deposed that claimant/injured was admitted in the hospital on 17.01.2015. He was suffering jaw injury upper and lower, forearm. He further stated that his jaw injury was operated at two places and was realigned and the patient remained admitted as indoor patient from 17.01.2015 to 31.01.2015 . He further stated that he was discharged in satisfactory condition. The claimant has not filed any bill pertaining to his treatment in the Command Hospital, Chandimandir and during cross-examination, he admitted that his entire treatment including diet was fully free as his son is in Army. The aforesaid evidence proves that the claimant was admitted in the hospital for about 15 days and he was operated twice during his staying in the hospital and even thereafter, Purushottam Kumar, MACT, Ambala/25.05.2017. UID No.HR0489 Malkiat Singh Versus Hardeep Singh etc. :: 8 :: he is still under follow up treatment. Hence, he must have suffered a lot of pain and sufferings. Pain component in such type of injuries and surgery must have been on higher side. Keeping in view the injuries suffered and period of admission in the hospital, petitioner is awarded a sum of Rs.15,000/- towards compensation for pain and sufferings. 15.Claimant during cross-examination has admitted that his entire treatment including diet was fully free as his son is in Army and no bill has been proved on re cord, therefore, he is not entitled to any compensation towards medical expenses. There is nothing on record to show that claimant has become permanent disable, therefore, he is not entitled for any compensation for permanent disability. 16.Keeping in view the treatment and admission in the hospital, he must have spent some amount on transportation and attendant charges, therefore, he is awarded Rs.5,000/- towards compensation for transport and attendant charges etc. As claimant remained admitted in the hospital for fifteen days and completely bed ridden for that period, therefore, a sum of Rs.8000/- is awarded towards loss of enjoyment of life during his admission in the hospital. 17.The claimant was admittedly a retired government servant and is getting Rs.9000/- per month as pension. Though claimant has pleaded that he was employed as security guard at Barwala Telephone Exchange and used to earn Rs.7500/- P.M and also running part time Mini Milk Dairy of Buffalos and used to sell 20 kgs of milk daily @ Rs.40/- Purushottam Kumar, MACT, Ambala/25.05.2017. UID No.HR0489 Malkiat Singh Versus Hardeep Singh etc. :: 9 :: per kg. However, no proof regarding employment as security guard and selling of milk by the petitioners has been placed on record, therefore, the claimant is not entitled to any compensation on account of loss of any income, as he is only a pensioner. 18.Taking into consideration the evidence on the file, the compensation to be awarded to petitioner under various heads is assessed as under :- 1.For pain and suffering Rs.15,000-00 2.For special diet and transportation Rs 5,000-00 2.For loss of enjoyment of life Rs.8,000-00 Total Rs.28,000-00 19.As a result of above discussion, compensation to be awarded to petitioner comes to Rs.28,000/- alongwith interest @ 7.5% P.A from the date of filing of petition till realization. 20.Now it is to be decided as to who is liable to pay compensation to the petitioner. ISSUES NO.3&4 : 21.Learned counsel for respondent no.3/Insurance company vehemently argued that respondent no.1 was not having valid and effective driving license at the time of accident and this fact is duly proved on record as such respondent no.2/insured has violated the terms and conditions of insurance policy as such respondent no.3 be exonerated from paying compensation, if any, awarded by this court.

Moreover, the report of RTO, Nagaland only shows that all licenses other than smart card format are to be treated as cancelled, therefore, license of respondent no.1 was cancelled as per above order.

The onus to prove that respondent no.1 was not having valid and effective driving license was on respondent no.3/Insurance company but as discussed above it completely failed to discharge the said onus and failed to prove that respondent no.1 was not having valid and effective driving license on the date of accident.

Yogesh Sehgal, Advocate for respondents no.1 and 2 Sh.

While providing necessary particulars as required under the Motor Vehicles Act and the Rules thereunder, the claimant inter-alia averred that on 19 .05.2014 at about 12.30 PM, he was going back to his village alongwith his brother namely Dalbir Singh alias Kala on his motorcycle bearing registration No.HR99-FS(T)/4768, after selling milk in various houses at Railway Colony, Ambala Cantt, as per routine and motorcycle was being driven by him at normal speed on correct left side of the road, whereas his brother Dalbir Singh alias Kala was pillion rider. It is further averred that when they reached near Sainik Rest House, Ambala Cantt, Swift Car bearing registration No.HR13H/8190 being driven by respondent no.1 came from back side i.e. Ambala City side in rash and negligent manner, at high speed without blowing horn and hit his motorcycle, due to which, he and his brother fell down alongwith the motorcycle and claimant suffered serious and multiple injuries on his body including multiple fracture on his right leg, whereas his brother suffered minor injuries. It is further averred that after causing the LAKHMIR SINGH VERSUS RA VINDER 3 accident, respondent no.1 stopped for a while, but on seeing the gathering of passers-by, he left away. It is further averred that claimant was shifted to Civil Hospital, Ambala City, from there he was referred to Nandra Hospital, Ambala Cantt, where he remained admitted for about one month and his right leg was operated upon and rod was inserted and that till date, he is bed-ridden till today and is unable to even walk without assistance of other person. It is further averred that accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle in question being driven by respondent no.1. It is further averred that FIR no.132 dated 20.05.2014 was registered against respondent no.1 for commission of offences punishable under Sections 279, 337, 338 IPC in P.S. Parao, on the statement of claimant Lakhbir Singh regarding this accident. It is further averred that claimant is a young married person and was earning Rs.25,000/- per month by running a dairy and used to sell the milk door-to-door in the City on motorcycle, which requires hard manual labour and due to this accident, he became permanently disabled and is unable to do his daily routine work and under compelling circumstances, he has to engage an assistant for work and he has spent about Rs. Five lakh on special diet, treatment, medical tests and equipments etc. It is further averred that his entire work i.e. source of his livelihood, suffered a lot due to the injuries and hospitalization. Claimant claimed compensation to the tune of Rs.15,00,000/- alongwith interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of filing of LAKHMIR SINGH VERSUS RA VINDER 4 present petition till its realization. It is prayed that respondent no.1 being driver, respondent no.2 being owner, whereas respondent no.3 being insurer, of vehicle in question, be held liable to pay compensation jointly and severally. 3.Upon notice, respondents no.1 and 2 appeared and filed joint written statement taking preliminary objections qua maintainability, locus standi and non-joinder and mis-joinder of necessary and proper parties etc. On merits, it is submitted that no accident took place with the vehicle of answering respondents and petition has been filed wrongly with a view to get compensation. It is further submitted that police falsely implicated the vehicle of answering respondents and false FIR was got registered against respondent no.1 in connivance with claimant and other witnesses, so claimant is not entitled to any compensation, as claimed. However, it is admitted that respondent no.2 is owner of car in question, which is insured with respondent no.3. It is further averred that amount claimed by claimant is very excessive. It is further averred that claimant and police have concocted a false story and they are not under any liability to pay the compensation to claimant, as no such accident took place with the car. Denying all other averments, dismissal of claim petition with costs was prayed for. 4.On notice, respondent no.3 appeared and filed written statement raising preliminary objection that respondent no.1 not having valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident etc. On merits, it is averred that no accident, as alleged, has taken place with LAKHMIR SINGH VERSUS RA VINDER 5 alleged car bearing registration no.HR13H/8190 and petition has been filed in collusion with respondent no.1 and 2, just to extract compensation from the answering respondent by falsely implicating the vehicle in question on the basis of concocted and manipulated version, as this fact is clearly proved from the initial medical record, where it is mentioned that accident took place with some unknown vehicle, but the car in question was very cleverly introduced inspite of the fact that registration number of offending car was initially mentioned in the FIR as HR13/8190 and this manipulation is also exposed and falsified from the fact that the said car, though was alleged being coming at 12.30 PM from Ambala City side, had actually crossed Karnal toll plaza at 11.19 AM while coming from Delhi to Ambala side and even the vehicles coming from that direction move on other lane of road. It is further submitted that time of occurrence in the FIR is mentioned as 11.30 hours. It is further submitted that even if it is presumed, though not admitted, that any accident had occurred on aforesaid date, even then, answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation, as claimant suffered alleged injuries only due to his sole rash and negligent driving of motorcycle with drums bearing No.HR99- FS(T)/4768 at fast and uncontrollable speed without caring for rules and traffic on the road and consequently, skidding thereof. It is further submitted that false and manipulated case was registered in connivance with local police and respondents no.1 and 2 just to help the claimant in getting compensation from the insurance company and that amount claimed is imaginary and exaggerated one. Denying all other averments, LAKHMIR SINGH VERSUS RA VINDER 6 dismissal of claim petition was prayed for. 5.Replication was not filed. From pleadings of parties, following issues were framed: 1.Whether an accident took place on 19.05.2014 due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle marka Swift Car bearing registration No.HR13H/8190 being driven by respondent no.1, resulting into injuries to Sh. Lakhmir Singh, as alleged? OPP 2.If issue no.1 is proved, then to what amount of compensation and from whom, claimant is entitled to receive it? OPP 3.Whether claim petition is not maintainable in its present form? OPR 4.Whether respondent no.1 who was driving the vehicle in question at the time of alleged accident was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident? OPR 5.Relief 6.In order to prove his case, claimant himself stepped as PW1 and examined Dr. Vikas Paul as PW2. In documentary evidence, documents Ex.P1 to Ex.P7, Mark-A and Mark-B were tendered. 7.On the other hand, respondents examined Kewal Krishan, Criminal Ahlmad as RW1. In documentary evidence, ld. counsel for respondent no.3 tendered documents Ex.R7 to Ex.R12. 8.No rebuttal evidence was led. 9.I have heard learned counsel for parties and have gone through material pleadings, evidence and legal proposition applicable to present case. My findings on above issues are as under:- LAKHMIR SINGH VERSUS RA VINDER 7 Issue No.1 10. To prove this issue, ld. counsel for claimant took me to the testimony of PW1 and PW2 and contended that accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving Car bearing registration no. HR13H/8190 in rash and negligent manner and he suffered serious and multiple injuries in the accident. 11. On the other hand, ld. counsel for respondent no.1 and 2 submitted that car has been falsely implicated and no such accident was caused by Car no.HR13H/8190 and FIR was got registered on next day, that too, against vehicle no.HR13/8190 in collusion with police, on the basis of concocted story just to extract compensation. 12.Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 submitted that mere registration of FIR is not sufficient to conclude that accident was caused by respondent no.1 or he was driving the vehicle in rash and negligent manner. He further submitted that there is delay of one day in registration of FIR. Ld. counsel prayed for dismissal of the petition. 13.As per record, accident occurred on 19.05.2014 and after the accident, injured was taken to Civil Hospital, Ambala City, from where he was referred to Nandra Hospital, Ambala Cantt. It is admitted case of claimant that he alongwith his brother Dalbir Singh alias Kala was going back to his village, but alleged eye witness/injured Dalbir Singh alias Kala was not examined by claimant to prove alleged accident. Thus, the best evidence has been withheld by claimant. No other eye-witness has been examined by claimant despite the fact that accident occurred in day LAKHMIR SINGH VERSUS RA VINDER 8 light, as same is stated to have occurred at about 12:30 PM on 19.05.2014 near Sainik Rest House, Ambala Cantt. Moreover, no Doctor from Nandra Hospital has been examined to prove the treatment record of claimant. 14.PW1 Lakhmir Singh/claimant is the most relevant witness for decision of issue no.1. He filed his affidavit Ex.PW1/A in his evidence and deposed that on 19.05.2014 at about 12.30 P.M., he was coming to his village alongwith his brother Dalbir Singh alias Kala on motorcycle bearing registration No.HR99-FS(T)/4768, being driven by him at normal speed. He further deposed that when they reached near Sainik Rest House, Ambala Cantt, Swift car bearing registration No.HR13H/8190 being driven by respondent no.1 came in rash and negligent manner from back side at very high speed and without blowing horn, hit his motorcycle, due to which both of them fell down alongwith motorcycle and he suffered serious and multiple injuries on his legs, left hand, forehead and head including multiple fracture on his right leg. He further deposed that after causing accident, respondent no.1 stopped for a while and left the spot after seeing gathering of passers-by. He further deposed that his brother also suffered minor injuries. He further testified that he was taken to Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt., from where he was referred to Nandra Hospital, Ambala Cantt., where his right leg was operated upon and rod was inserted. He further deposed that the matter was reported and FIR no.132 dated 20.05.2014 for commission of offences punishable under Sections 279, 337, 338 IPC was registered in P.S. Parao. 15.In order to rebut the claim of claimant, respondents have LAKHMIR SINGH VERSUS RA VINDER 9 examined RW1 Kewal Krishan, Criminal Ahlmad in the Court of Ms. Monika Banswal, learned Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Ambala, who has brought the summoned file titled as State Versus Ravinder bearing FIR No.132 dated 20.05.2014, registered for commission of offences punishable under Sections 279, 337, 338, 427 IPC in P.S. Parao. He also proved vehicle search report issued by Karnal Toll Plaza as Ex.R4, medical report issued by Nandra Hospital dated 19.05.2014 as Ex.R5 and site plan as Ex.R6. 16.As per case of claimant, his brother Dalbir Singh had noted down the number of the vehicle in question, however it is matter of record that he has not been examined as witness by claimant. He was the best witness to depose about number of the vehicle and he could have deposed about the manner in which the accident occurred. This Tribunal is of the view that to avoid cross-examination, Dalbir Singh alias Kala has not been examined by petitioner as witness in this case. 17.If Dalbir Singh alias Kala had noted down registration number of alleged offending car, he was at liberty to disclose the same to police immediately after the accident and he could have got lodged the FIR. The FIR was got registered on next day of the accident on the statement of claimant. As per case of claimant that initially, he was taken to Civil Hospital Ambala City and MLR Mark-B was conducted. As per noting on the MLR, the accident occurred on 19.5.2014 at 11.57 and he was brought to Civil Hospital Ambala City at 12.30 PM. Thereafter, he was taken to Nandra Hospital Ambala Cantt. As per Patient Discharge LAKHMIR SINGH VERSUS RA VINDER 10 Summary Ex.P6, claimant was admitted in Nandra Hospital on 19.5.2014 at 3.49 PM and as per Ex.P6, patient was admitted with history of roadside accident with unknown vehicle. If number of the vehicle was noted down by Dalbir, who was pillion rider with claimant as per case of claimant, then question arises why this fact was not disclosed at that time and why it was got recorded that patient met with accident with an unknown vehicle. 18.As per Vehicle Search Report Ex.R4 issued by Soma Company, which maintains National Highway No.1, the vehicle no.HR13H/8190 crossed Toll Tax through Lane no.6 at 11:19:40 AM on 19.5.2014. As per MLR Mark-B, accident occurred at 11.57 AM. Considering the fact that inter se distance between Ambala Cantt. and Karnal Toll Tax on GT Road is about 70 kms., this Tribunal is of the view that vehicle has been falsely implicated in this case and if case of claimant is believed, then the vehicle had crossed 70 kms. distance within 37 minuted from Karnal towards Chandigarh and then caused the accident, when vehicle was moving towards Delhi. 19.Admittedly, respondent no.1 is facing trial, but as held in the case of Geeta Devi and others vs. Ravinder Kumar and others, 2014 (11) RCR (Civil) 2090 , mere facing of trial is no ground to hold that accident is an outcome of rash and negligent driving of the vehicle in question in absence of any other evidence. 20.In view of settled law, only on the basis of the fact that respondent no.1 is facing trial, it can not be held that he was driving the LAKHMIR SINGH VERSUS RA VINDER 11 vehicle in rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. There is an unexplained delay of one day in registration of FIR and Dalbir Singh alias Kala, who had allegedly noted down the registration number of vehicle in question, was at liberty to disclose number of the vehicle to police, but he remained silent and has not even been examined as witness in this case, which creates doubt. 21.Considering entire record of the case, this Tribunal is of the view that car in question has been falsely implicated just to extract compensation. Accordingly, Issue no.1 is decided against petitioner. Issue no.2 to 4: 22.In view of findings recorded under issue no.1, issue no.2 to 4 have become redundant. Relief 23.In view of above discussion, present claim petition is dismissed with costs. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.2200/-. Memo of costs be prepared. File be consigned to record room.

When they reached near crossing cut between Tangri Bridge and Rama Petrol Pump, in the meantime a tractor-trolley bearing registration No.HR-07N-1221 came from the back side being driven by respondent no.1 in a very rash and negligent manner and hit the motorcycle, as a result of which both the motorcyclists fell down on the road and sustained injuries. The deceased trapped between the tractor and trolley. The deceased was taken to Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt but he died during treatment. Matter was reported to the police and FIR was got registered against the respondent no.1. Lastly, it was prayed that compensation amount to the tune of Rs.50,00,000/- be awarded to them on account of death of deceased Rajinder Singh Bhandari son of Surat Singh Bhandari along with interest Jagjit Singh, MACT Sarita etc. Vs.

All other material averments were denied and lastly prayed for dismissal of the petition. 4)The respondent no.2 did not appear despite service and accordingly, the respondent no.2 was proceeded exparte vide order dated 15.09.2015. 5)Respondent No.3 Insurance Company contested the petition by filing separate joint written statement and it was submitted that driver of the offending vehicle/respondent No.1 was not having valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident and insured willfully violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. The factum of accident as alleged by the claimants in the petition was denied and submitted that a false FIR has been registered against respondent No.1 in collusion with the police. Also, the factum of rash and negligence of the offending vehicle was denied. Remaining contents of the petition were denied and prayer to dismiss the petition was made. Jagjit Singh, MACT Sarita etc. Vs. Surinder etc. 4 6)Replication was not filed. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed :- 1.Whether the accident in question causing death of Rajinder Singh took place due to rash and negligent driving of tractor bearing No.HR-07N-1221 by respondent no.1, as alleged? OPP. 2.If issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation the petitioners are entitled to and from whom? OPP. 3.Whether the insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation, in view of the preliminary objections raised in the written statement and whether there has been a breach of terms and conditions of the policy of insurance? OPR-3 4.Relief. 7) In support of their case, claimants have examined Dr. Pooja Gupta as PW-1, Rajesh Kumar as PW-2 and claimant no.2 himself appeared in the witness box as PW-3 and also examined Ashok Kumar. Besides oral evidence, the following documents were placed on record:- Ex.P-1 & P-2 :MLRs Ex.P-3 :FIR Ex.P-4 :Charge Sheet Ex.P-5 :Report u/s 173 Cr.P.C.

Counsel for the petitioners closed the evidence. 8)On the other hand, the respondents have examined Kulbhushan as RW-1 and Manu Sharma as RW-2. Besides oral evidence, the following documents were placed on record:- Ex.R-1 :Crime Detail Form Ex.R-2 :Affidavit Ex.R-3 & R-4 :Mechanical Reports Ex.R-5 :Recovery Memo Ex.R-6 :Power of Attorney Ex.R-7 :Copy of R.C. Ex.R-8 :Copy of D.L. Ex.R-9 :Copy of Register Thereafter learned counsel closed the evidence of respondents. 9)No evidence in rebuttal was led by the petitioner. 10)I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the material placed on record. My issue-wise finding are given as under:- ISSUE No.1:- 11)The onus of proving this issue was on the petitioners and to prove the same, learned counsel for the petitioners argued that in the Jagjit Singh, MACT Sarita etc. Vs. Surinder etc. 6 present case on 27.09.2014 Narinder Bhandari alongwith his father Rajinder Bhandari was going on motorcycle driven by Narinder Bhandari, PW-3. At about 10.30 A.M. while going from Tangri to Rama Petrol Pump, the respondent no.1 came driving his tractor-trolley in a rash and negligent manner and struck against the motorcycle, as a result of which the motorcycle got entangled and Rajinder Bhandari suffered serious injuries and he was taken to the hospital, where as a result of the injuries he died. FIR in the present case was got registered, which is Ex.P-3 on the same day by Narinder Bhandari and the FIR mentions the description of the tractor-trolley as Sonalika DI750 of Blue colour and the respondent no.1 was facing trial for the said offence as per charge sheet, Ex.P-4, and the report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. was Ex.P-5. It was argued that as a result the evidence makes it amply clear regarding death of Rajinder Bhandari having taken place by the rash and negligent driving of his tractor by respondent no.1. 12)Learned counsel for the respondents meanwhile argued that no such accident ever took place due to any rash or negligent driving of respondent no.1 and a false claim petition has been filed by the petitioners. 13)I have heard the counsels for the parties and perused the file carefully. 14)Perusal of FIR shows the manner in which the accident took Jagjit Singh, MACT Sarita etc. Vs. Surinder etc. 7 place and it also mentions about the involvement of tractor without number plate, Marka Sonalika DI750 of Blue Colour. FIR has also been registered on the very same day of the accident and the respondent no.1 was facing trial for the said offence. Nothing contrary to this could be brought on record by the respondents. Even otherwise, it is observed by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Smt. Surinder Kaur and others Versus Lakhbir Singh and another 2007(1) PLR 494 that; “F.I.R.-Being a public document is admissible in evidence as such and if no objection is raised at the time of production thereof, the same is to be read in evidence.” Similar view was held by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Bansi Yadav and another Versus Krishan Kumar and another 2004(3) ACC 758. Keeping in view the principle laid down in authorities (Supra), it becomes clear that the FIR being a public document and when not rebutted is to be considered as true. It is also important to note that the proceedings in MACT cases are of summary nature and the case is not to be proved like civil case where case is to be proved from the point of preponderance of probabilities or in criminal case, where charge is to be proved beyond shadows of doubt. The FIR has been registered against the respondent no.1. So, in view of law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Jagjit Singh, MACT Sarita etc. Vs. Surinder etc. 8 Radhay Shyam, 1993(2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008(2) R.C.R. (civil) 774, it can be safely held that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle Tractor-trolley bearing registration No.HR-07N-1221 by respondent no.1. Accordingly, issue no.1 is decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUES No.2 AND 3:- 15)The onus of proving issue no.2 was on the petitioners while onus of proving issue no.3 was upon the respondents. Finding of one issue shall have bearing on the other and hence the same are being decided together. To prove the above issues, learned counsel for the petitioners argued that the deceased has left behind four dependents which includes his widow, two children and his mother and he was working as a Welder and partner in a firm. The income tax returns of the deceased have been brought on record showing his montly income to the extent of Rs.14,000/- per month and the petitioners were accordingly entitled to compensation in the present case. 16)Learned counsel for respondent No.1 meanwhile argued that although no such accident took place by any fault of the respondent no.1 and the respondent no.1 is not liable to pay any compensation. If the Tribunal comes to such conclusion, then the respondent no.1 holds a valid Jagjit Singh, MACT Sarita etc. Vs. Surinder etc. 9 Driving License, Ex.R-8, which entitles him to drive tractor and the registration certificate of the vehicle is Ex.R-7 and it is the respondent no.3 who is liable to pay the amount of compensation. 17)Learned counsel for respondent no.3 meanwhile argued that the respondent no.3 is not liable to pay the amount of compensation in the present case and moreover, the claimant no.2 being major son is not entitled to any compensation. It was argued that no specific proof of income of deceased has come on file and under what capacity the income tax return was filed is not explained and it also does not have any balance sheet. No partnership deed has come on record or any account of the partnership firm and neither any partner was examined to prove about the deceased being a partner in any firm. Learned counsel further pointed out to the testimony of the witnesses examined, where PW-3 has stated that he was looking after the factory these days and his father did not have any Diploma of any trade. He was also not aware whether there was any partnership deed of the firm and neither any partnership deed was executed after the death of this father. He stated that the registration number of the tractor-trolley was told to him by the police and he was not joined in the investigation. That the driver disclosed his name at the time of accident where he was apprehended. Learned counsel also pointed out to the testimony of Jagjit Singh, MACT Sarita etc. Vs. Surinder etc. 10 respondent's witnesses to argue that the respondent no.1 only held Driving License to drive tractor, whereas the vehicle had a trolley fitted and which was loaded with Bajri and therefore, there was commercial use of the tractor and violation of the policy and the respondent no.3 was thus not liable to pay any compensation. It has been stated by RW-1 about the tractor being registered for agricultural purposes and not trolley registered with it. RW-2 proved that the D.L. of respondent no.1 was valid only for tractor and not to drive any goods carrying vehicle or commercial vehicle. In support of his arguments learned counsel placed reliance upon the principles laid down in Narinder Singh Vs. New India Assurance Co. Ltd. & Ors., 2014 ACJ 2421 , where it was held that in case vehicle is plied without registration, the insurance company is not liable. Tractor carrying goods without any permit and insurance company not being liable , for which reliance was placed upon Partap Singh Vs. National Insurance Co. Ltd. & Ors., 2016(2) TAC 166. Similar view was held in Natwar Parikh & Co. Ltd. Vs. State of Karnataka & Ors., 2015(3) ACC 749 . Reliance was also placed upon Mam Chand & Anr. Vs. Sunita Devi & Ors., 2013 ACJ 1332 , where it was held that “ Tractor- trolley used for transporting goods becomes a goods vehicle – Vehicle was loaded with sand and it was being plied on road which requires Jagjit Singh, MACT Sarita etc. Vs. Surinder etc. 11 valid route permit. ” With regard to respondent no.1 was not having valid D.L. to drive the goods vehicle , reliance was placed upon United India Insurance Co Ltd. Vs. Sujata Arora & Ors., 2013 ACJ 2129 . Placing reliance upon the above cited authorities (Supra) it was argued that the respondents no.1 and 2 are liable to pay the amount of compensation in the present case. 18)I have heard the learned counsels for the parties and have perused the case file carefully. 18)In the present case the petition has been filed by four claimants who are widow, two children of deceased and his mother. It is seen that the claimant no.2 is adult son of the deceased and as has been held in Sarla Verma's case, could not be dependent upon the deceased. With regard to the income of the deceased, no proof of income could come on record including any partnership deed or any account being maintained by the firm or any proof of monthly income. The marked documents which are Income Tax Returns without any supporting evidence or any balance sheet cannot be considered to come to any conclusion about the monthly earning of the deceased. 19)It is further seen that it has come in evidence that the tractor being driven by respondent no.1 had trolley attached with Bajri loaded in it and as a result keeping in view the case laws as cited by the learned Jagjit Singh, MACT Sarita etc. Vs. Surinder etc. 12 counsel for respondent no.3 the vehicle becomes a goods carrying vehicle which requires a special permit as it was not being used for agricultural purposes. Moreover, the respondent no.1 was only entitled as per his DL to drive tractor and not a commercial vehicle or goods carrying vehicle. Keeping in view all these aspects, the petitioners no.1, 3 and 4 become entitled to following amount of compensation in the present case. The accident having taken place in the year 2014 even if the deceased is considered as a labourer, he would earn minimum amount of Rs.7000/- per month and considering the fact that he was an income tax payee, he would be earning little more than that, therefore, his monthly income is considered as Rs.10,000/-, which makes annual income as Rs.1,20,000/-. Having left behind three dependents, 1/3rd of this amount is to be deducted towards personal living and expenses of the deceased, which comes to Rs.40,000/- and the balance comes to Rs.80,000/-. The deceased as per PAN Card placed on file was born in the year 1965 and the accident having taken place in the year 2014, he would be 49 years old at the time of accident and multiplier that would be apply in the present case is that of “13” and by applying the same, the amount comes to Rs.10,40,000/-. Apart from this, the petitioners would also be entitled to Rs.25,000/- for performing last rites and the amount comes to Rs.10,65,000/-. The petitioner no.1 would also be entitled to a separate sum of Rs.50,000/- for loss of consortium, whereas petitioners no.3 and 4 Jagjit Singh, MACT Sarita etc. Vs. Surinder etc. 13 would also be entitled to a separate sum of Rs.50,000/- each for loss of love and affection. The petitioners are also entitled to interest @ 7.5.% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization. 20)As already discussed the respondent no.1 was not entitled to drive the vehicle in question and there was violation of the terms and conditions of the policy, it would be the respondents no.1 and 2 who would be liable to pay the amount in compensation but keeping in view the circumstances of the case and the fact that the petitioners cannot be faulted for the negligence of the respondents no.1 and 2 and therefore, all the respondents would be jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation but the respondent no.3 is granted the right of recovery from respondents no.1 and 2. Issue no.2 is therefore, decided in favour of the petitioners and issue no.3 is partly decided in favour of respondent no.3. ISSUE NO. 4 (RELIEF):- 21)Keeping in view of my detailed discussion on all the aforesaid issues, the petition is allowed with costs. Out of the total amount of Rs.10,65,000/-, the petitioner no.1 would be entitled to a sum of Rs.5,65,000/- besides Rs.50,000/- for loss of consortium and the petitioner no.3 would be entitled to a sum of Rs.2,00,000/-, whereas petitioner no.4 would be entitled to a sum of Jagjit Singh, MACT Sarita etc. Vs. Surinder etc. 14 Rs.3,00,000/-, besides Rs.50,000/- each for loss of love and affection. The petitioners are also entitled for the interest of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization. Amount of compensation be disbursed in favour of petitioners no.1, 3 and 4 in cash against proper receipt and identification . The respondents no.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation but respondent no.3 is granted a right of recovery from respondents no.1 and 2. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly and file be consigned to record room after due compliance. Pronounced in open Court (JAGJIT SINGH) Dated: 06.08.2016 Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ambala.

Ld. counsel for claimant relied upon statement of claimant Nirmal Kaur, who appeared as PW2 and tendered her affidavit Ex.PW2/A in her evidence, wherein she specifically deposed that accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. She was cross-examined at length, but there is nothing on record to disbelieve her version. Her version has been further corroborated by PW3 Rajiv Kumar, who was driving motor-cycle, on which petitioner was pillion rider. 11.It is matter of record that FIR No.31 dated 23.2.2015 Ex.P1 was registered in regard to the accident in question. PW1 Naresh Kumar Ahlmad proved that Anil Kumar respondent no.1 is facing trial in case titled as State versus Anil Kumar and he has been charge sheeted vide Order dated 14.8.2015. 12.In view of above discussion, it is held that claimant has successfully proved that accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving Swift Desire Car bearing registration no.HR02Z/9540 in a rash and negligent manner and petitioner sustained injuries in the accident. Hence, Issue no.1 is decided in favour of petitioner. ISSUE NO.2: 13.In this case, compensation has been claimed by petitioner on account of injuries sustained by her.

(Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 1 of 17 Pages) Dt: 29.03.2016. MACP No. 04 of 2015 Shakal Dass & Anr. Vs. Jagir Singh & Ors. Facts as pleaded: 2.According to petitioners, on 06.11.2014, deceased was coming back from village Dera Salempur after finishing his work of mason / fixing tiles and stones and going towards Barara on his bicycle on correct left side of the road. At about 7.15 p.m.,when he reached near Primary Health Centre, Barara on Barara-Shahabad Road, a canter bearing registration No. HR-37A-2057 (offending vehicle), being driven by respondent no.1 Jagir Singh at a very high speed and in zig-zag manner, without blowing any horn, came from behind and by going towards wrong side of the road, struck against the bicycle of deceased. Due to impact, deceased fell on the road and sustained multiple simple and grievous injuries. He was taken to Primary Health Centre, Barara, from where, after giving first aid, he was taken to M.M. Medical College and Hospital, Mullana, but he died on the same day. On 07.11.2014, post mortem of the deceased was conducted. On the statement of Shri Ram Pukar Dass, an eye witness, FIR N:171 dated 06.11.1014 under Sections 279 and 304-A IPC was registered at Police Station Barara. 3.The petitioners submit that deceased was quite hale and healthy young boy of 19 years of age. He was doing the work of mason i.e. fixing of tiles / stones on the walls and floors etc. and was earning 15,000/- per month. The petitioners were fully dependent upon the₹ earnings of the deceased, but due to his untimely death, they have been driven on road as they have no source of income to maintain them. They spent approximately 50,000/- on the treatment, transportation ₹ and last rites of the deceased. With all these averments, the petitioners claim compensation of 20 lacs against respondents, who are the respective driver, owner₹ and insurer of the offending vehicle. 4.Respondents no.1 and 2 i.e. driver and owner of offending vehicle, in their joint written statement, took preliminary objections regarding maintainability and concealment of true and material facts from the court. (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 2 of 17 Pages) Dt: 29.03.2016. MACP No. 04 of 2015 Shakal Dass & Anr. Vs. Jagir Singh & Ors. On merits, denying the age, occupation, income of deceased, injuries, death and expenses on his treatment etc., it is pleaded that no accident took place on 06.11.2014 due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent no.1. It is alleged that a false FIR was registered against him by involving the offending vehicle by claimants in connivance with the police in order to get compensation. They submit that they are not liable to pay any compensation to the petitioners as accident was caused due to negligence of deceased because he was paddling his bicycle on wrong side of the road under the influence of liquor. The amount of compensation claimed in the petition is alleged to be highly exaggerated. With this stand and controverting other averments, they prayed for dismissal of the petition. 5.Respondent no.3 i.e. Insurance Company, in its separate written statement, raised various customary preliminary objections that claim petition is bad for mis-joinder and non-joinder of necessary parties; that petitioners have no locus standi to file and maintain the petition; that it is a case of contributory negligence of bicyclist-deceased; and that respondent no.1 was not having a valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident and was driving it in violation of terms and conditions of Insurance Policy. On merits, contents of the claim petition including nature of injuries, income of deceased, death, postmortem, expenses on last rites of deceased etc. are alleged to be vague and indefinite and that a false FIR was lodged by manipulating the wrong facts in order to get compensation from it, amount of which is alleged to be highly excessive and so, it is not liable to pay the same. Prayer is made for dismissal of the petition. Issues: 6.Following issues were framed for adjudication:- 1.Whether the accident in question took place by rash and negligent driving of TATA Canter bearing (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 3 of 17 Pages) Dt: 29.03.2016. MACP No. 04 of 2015 Shakal Dass & Anr. Vs. Jagir Singh & Ors. registration No. HR-37A-2057 by respondent no.1 Jagir Singh resulting into death of Gauri Kumar, as alleged.? OPP. 2.If issue no.1 is proved, whether the claimants are entitled to compensation, if so, how much and from whom? OPP. 3.Whether the respondent no.1 was not having a valid and effective driving license on the date of the accident, if so its effect? OPR-3. 4.Whether respondent no.2 has violated the terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy and the respondent no.3 is not liable to indemnify the respondent no.2 ? OPR-3. 5.Relief. 7. Parties have produced evidence in support of their respective stands. 8. I have heard learned counsel for the parties at length and have appraised the evidence on record thoroughly and carefully. Findings on the various issues are as under:- Responsibility for causing accident: ISSUE NO.1: 9. In order to prove this issue, petitioners have examined Ram Pukar Dass as PW1. He is author of the FIR. In his affidavit Ex.PW1/A, tendered as examination-in-chief, he stated on oath about the manner of the accident, as pleaded in the petition. He also proved FIR Ex.P1 lodged on his statement. He has been cross-examined at length, but nothing could be elicited so as to disbelieve him. 10.Petitioners also tendered in evidence report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. submitted by police in the court as Ex.P4; copy of the post mortem report of deceased Gauri Kumar as Ex.P2 and charge as framed by court of learned JMIC, Ambala against respondent no.1 Jagir in a criminal case as Ex.P3. (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 4 of 17 Pages) Dt: 29.03.2016. MACP No. 04 of 2015 Shakal Dass & Anr. Vs. Jagir Singh & Ors. 11. There is no evidence in rebuttal on the part of the respondents, on the aforesaid issue. 12.Perusal of the FIR Ex.P1 reveals that manner of the accident disclosed therein is same as stated in the petition and as testified by PW1 Ram Pukar Dass. Report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex.P4 reveals that police investigated the matter and concluded after investigation that accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of Jagir while driving Canter No. HR-37A-2057. The court of learned JMIC considered the material and found prima facie case against respondent no.1 and accordingly charge-sheeted him under Sections 279 and 304-A IPC, as is evident from Ex.P3. Post mortem report Ex.P2 reveals that death of Gauri Kumar took place on 6.11.2014, though post mortem examination was conducted on 7.11.2014. 13.In the face of above supporting documents, there is no reason to disbelieve testimony of PW1 regarding manner of the accident. The driver of the offending vehicle i.e. respondent no.1 Jagir though appeared in witness box as RW2 but did not controvert statement of PW1 regarding manner of the accident or proved the stand as taken by respondents in the written statement. In these circumstances, adverse inference is liable to be drawn against respondents. 14.As a result of above discussion, issue no.1 is decided in favour of claimants by holding that accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of Canter No. HR-37A-2057, which was being driven by respondent no.1 at the relevant time and which resulted into death of Gauri Kumar son of Shakal Dass. Assessment of Compensation: ISSUE NO.2: 15. In support of this issue, one of the claimant Shri Shakal Dass, who is father of deceased Gauri Kumar, appeared in the witness box as PW2 and testified that his deceased son Gauri Kumar was 19 years of (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 5 of 17 Pages) Dt: 29.03.2016. MACP No. 04 of 2015 Shakal Dass & Anr. Vs. Jagir Singh & Ors. age at the time of death. He further deposed that deceased was working as mason and used to earn 15,000/- per month and that claimants were ₹ dependent upon him. In cross-examination, he denied that deceased was not more than 16 years old . He disclosed further that his son was doing labour work for the last 7-8 years. He further admitted that he is not having any bank account in the name of deceased or any documentary proof to reveal his income. 16.Except for the bald statement made by PW2 Shakal Dass regarding earnings of the deceased, there is no other cogent evidence. There is nothing to suggest that deceased was income tax payee or was maintaining any bank account or any account relating to the income and expenses. As per post mortem report Ex.P2, deceased was 18 years of age. Having regard to the age of the deceased and the fact that he was working as a mason, notional income of the deceased is taken to be 6000/- per month i.e. 72,000/- per annum.₹ ₹ 17.Admittedly, deceased died unmarried and so, in view of Sarla Verma Versus Delhi Transport Corporation, 2009 ACJ 1298 , half of the earnings is to be deducted towards self expenses. As such, dependency works out to be 36,000/-per annum.₹ 18.It may also be noted that only the mother of deceased i.e. claimant no.2 Smt. Tara Devi alias Nagina Devi shall be considered to be the dependent upon the deceased because father Shakal Dass-claimant no.1 must be earning himself and cannot be considered to be dependent upon the deceased. Reliance in this regard can be placed on Sarla Verma Versus Delhi Transport Corporation, 2009 ACJ 1298 , wherein, it was observed as under:- “31. Where the deceased was a bachelor and the claimants are the parents, the deduction follows a different principle. In regard to bachelors, normally 50 per cent is deducted as personal and living expenses, because it is assumed that a bachelor would tend to spend more on himself. Even otherwise, there is also the possibility of his (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 6 of 17 Pages) Dt: 29.03.2016. MACP No. 04 of 2015 Shakal Dass & Anr. Vs. Jagir Singh & Ors. getting married in a short time, in which event the contribution to the parent (s) and siblings is likely to be cut drastically. Further, subject to evidence to the contrary, the father is likely to have his own income and will not be considered as a dependent and the mother alone will be considered as a dependent. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, brothers and sisters will not be considered as dependents, because they will either be independent and earning, or married, or be dependent on the father. 32. Thus even if the deceased is survived by parents and siblings, only the mother would be considered to be a dependent and 50 per cent would be treated as the personal and living expenses of the bachelor and 50 per cent as the contribution to the family. However, where family of the bachelor is large and dependent on the income of the deceased, as in a case where he has a widowed mother and large number of younger non-earning sisters or brothers, his personal and living expenses may be restricted to one-third and contribution to the family will be taken as two-third.” 19.Coming to the question that which of the multiplier will be applicable, there are divergent views on this point. In M. Mansoor Versus United India Insurance Company, 2013 ACJ 2849; P.S.Somanathan Versus District Insurance Officer, (2011-2) PLR 497; and Amrit Bhanu Shali Versus National Insurance Co. Ltd., 2012 ACJ 2002, the age of the deceased was taken to be the basis for applying the multiplier. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents have referred to New India Assurance Company Ltd. Vs. Shanti Pathak, 2007 ACJ 2188, wherein it was held by Hon'ble Supreme Court that age of claimants was required to be noticed and it was made basis for applying the multiplier. 20.It is to be noted that the judgment in Shanti Pathak's case (cited supra), as relied by learned counsel for respondents, was delivered by a Larger Bench of Three Hon'ble Judges and so, it must prevail since the contrary view in the three cases i.e. M. Mansoor's case, (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 7 of 17 Pages) Dt: 29.03.2016. MACP No. 04 of 2015 Shakal Dass & Anr. Vs. Jagir Singh & Ors. P.S.Somanathan's case and Amrit Bhanu Shali's case (cited supra) was taken by smaller Bench of Hon'ble Two Judges. By referring to all the above four judgments of Hon'ble Supreme Court, same view was taken by Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court in ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Vs. Santosh [FAO N: 2962 of 2012 decided on 5.11.2014]. 21.Learned counsel for petitioners has then referred to Munna Lal Jain Vs. Vipin Kumar Sharma, a three judges Bench authority of Hon'ble Supreme court rendered on 15.05.2015 in Civil Appeal No. 4497 of 2015, wherein age of the deceased was taken into consideration to apply the multiplier. 22.This is true that a Three Judges Bench of Hon'ble Supreme Court in a later judgment of Munna Lal Jain's case (cited supra) has held that multiplier is to be used with reference to the age of the deceased but in the said Munna Lal Jain's case (cited supra), the three Judges Bench decision of New India Assurance Company Ltd. Vs. Shanti Pathak, 2007 ACJ 2188 , wherein it was held by Hon'ble Supreme Court that age of claimants was required to be noticed and it was made basis for applying the multiplier, was not brought to the notice of their Lordships. 23.In view of the legal position as discussed earlier, it is held that Shanti Pathak's judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court is to be applied to the facts and circumstances of the case, as per which, it is age of the claimants, which is to be taken into account and not age of the deceased. 24.Consequently, it is held that age of the mother of the deceased is to be taken into account for applicability of proper multiplier. 25.As per affidavit of claimant no.1 Shakal Dass placed on file, his age is 51 years; wheres age of claimant no.2 Smt. Tara Devi alias Smt. Nagina Devi is 46 years. Having regard to the said age of claimant (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 8 of 17 Pages) Dt: 29.03.2016. MACP No. 04 of 2015 Shakal Dass & Anr. Vs. Jagir Singh & Ors. Smt. Tara Devi alias Smt. Nagina Devi, proper multiplier will be 13. Here itself it may be clarified that in case of death of unmarried deceased son, it is the age of the dependent claimant, which is to be taken into account to use proper multiplier. 26.With dependency at 36,000/- per annum and by using the₹ multiplier at 13, compensation works out to be 36,000 x 13 = 4,68,000/₹-. 27. Beside above, claimant also deserve to be compensated for funeral expenses and 'loss of love & affection'. 28. In Rajesh Versus Rajbir's case, 2013( 4) Law Herald 3006 , it was observed by Hon'ble Supreme Court that the head “funeral expenses” does not mean the fee paid in the crematorium for the use of space in the cementery. There are many other expenses in connection with funeral and if the deceased is follower of any particular region, there are several religious practices and conventions pursuant to death in a family, all of which are quite expensive. Taking into account these factors, Hon'ble Supreme Court held that it will be just, fair and equitable to award at least an amount of 25,000/- under the head of “funeral expenses”, in the ₹ absence of any evidence to the contrary of the higher expenses. 29. In this case, there is no evidence to the contrary. Therefore, an amount of 25,000/-₹ is awarded as compensation under the head of “funeral expenses ”. 30. In Rajesh Versus Rajbir's case (cited supra) , Hon'ble Supreme Court also allowed compensation of 1 lac under the head of ₹ “loss of consortium”. It was observed that consortium is the right of spouse to the company, care, help, comfort, guidance, society, solace, affection and sexual relations with his/her mate. 31. In the present case, the deceased was a bachelor and so, no (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 9 of 17 Pages) Dt: 29.03.2016. MACP No. 04 of 2015 Shakal Dass & Anr. Vs. Jagir Singh & Ors. amount is payable towards loss of consortium. However, it cannot be ignored that death of deceased Gauri Kumar has deprived the claimant- mother of his love and affection and the support, which the deceased would have to become to the family. Therefore, under the head of 'Loss of love and affection” , I consider it to be just, fair and equitable to award an amount of 1,00,000/-.₹ 32. Consequent to the entire discussion as above, total compensation amount payable to claimant no.2 Smt. Tara Devi alias Smt. Nagina Devi, the mother of deceased, works out to be 5,93,000/-₹ as per the following details:- Sr. No. Head of compensation Amount. 1. Loss of Dependency. 4,68₹ ,000-00 2. Funeral expenses ₹25,000-00 3. Loss of love and affection to claimant no.2-mother 1,0₹ 0,000-00 Total 5,93₹ ,000-00 33. Ex.R3 is Insurance Policy, which reveals that offending vehicle was insured by respondent no.3 in the name of respondent no.2 for the period 01.03.2014 to 28.02.2015. This period covers the date of the accident. As such, it is held that all the three respondents being driver, owner and insurer of the offending vehicle are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation. 34. Consequently, issue no.2 is decided to the effect that only claimant no.2 Smt. Tara Devi alias Smt. Nagina Devi - mother of deceased Gauri Kumar is entitled to compensation of 5,93,000/-₹ payable jointly and severally by all the three respondents. It is also held that other claimant namely Shri Shakal Dass is not entitled to any compensation. ISSUE NO.3: 35. In support of this issue, respondent no. 3 i.e. Insurance (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 10 of 17 Pages) Dt: 29.03.2016. MACP No. 04 of 2015 Shakal Dass & Anr. Vs. Jagir Singh & Ors. Company examined RW1 Shri Jaswinder Pal, Criminal Ahlmad, who produced criminal file titled ''State Vs. Jagir Singh'' arising out of FIR No.171 dated 06.11.2014 registered at Police Station Barara under sections 279 and 304-A IPC i.e. pertaining to the accident of this case. He deposed that file contains recovery memo, copy of which is Ex.R1, whereby driving licence of accused Jagir Singh was taken into possession. Original driving licence is available on the file, copy of which is Ex.R2. He further deposed that Route Permit and Registration Certificate of the offending vehicle are not attached with the challan, though copy of the Insurance Policy is attached, which is Ex.R3. 36. Thereafter, respondent no.1 Jagir Singh entered the witness box as RW2. His testimony is quite material. It will be relevant to re- produce his entire examination-in-chief, which is as under:- ''I am the summoned witness. I have brought my original licence No.55343/PK/Prof/10 valid for authorized to drive M/C, LMV, MMV, HMV only, which is valid up to 21.12.2017 & the same was issued from DTO Phek, Nagaland on 22.11.2010. As per driving licence, my date of birth is 13.03.1973. The copy of the same is Ex.R4. I have also seen Ex.R2, which is also my licence and the same was taken in possession by the police in case titled ''State Vs. Jagir Singh'', vide FIR No.171 dated 06.11.2014. Ex.R4 was got issued from Nagaland by me approximately 8-9 years ago. I do not know how far Phek District in Nagaland from Ambala. Volunteered to say I am illiterate. I never resided in District Phek in Nagaland State. I also never resided in District Tuansang in Nagaland State. The licence no.31125 attached with the criminal file i.e. Ex.R2 was got prepared by my previous owner residing in District Yamuna Nagar and the licence No.55343/PK/Prof/10 i.e. Ex.R4 was got prepared by my present owner from Nagaland. Ex.R4 was not presented by me before the police. I am permanent resident of village Adhoi. I have brought my residence proof i.e. copy of Ration Card as Ex.R5 and copy of Aadhar Card as Ex.R6. I am not able to produce any documentary proof of residence and of employment in District (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 11 of 17 Pages) Dt: 29.03.2016. MACP No. 04 of 2015 Shakal Dass & Anr. Vs. Jagir Singh & Ors. of Nagaland State, as I never resided and never employed in Nagaland State.'' During cross-examination, he (RW2 Jagir) deposed that he was driving vehicle on the basis of Ex.R4 and not Ex.R2. He further stated that police never demanded his licence Ex.R2 and that Ex.R2 was not given by him to the police official. 37.It is, thus, apparent from record and the testimony of RW2 that respondent no.1 Jagir Singh was having two driving licences. Driving licence Ex.R2 was taken into possession by the police in criminal case, vide memo Ex.R1. In the said driving licence Ex.R2, date of birth of respondent no.1 Jagir Singh is described as 01.03.1971. Said driving licence bearing No.31125/TV/T/2012 is purported to have been issued by District Transport Officer, Tuangsang (Nagaland). On the other hand, other driving licence Ex.R4 is purported to have been issued by District Transport Officer, Phek, Nagaland. In the said driving licence, date of birth of respondent no.1 Jagir Singh is mentioned as 13.03.1973. The name, father's name and address of respondent no.1 Jagir Singh are the same. 38.As per testimony of RW2 Jagir Singh i.e. respondent no.1, both driving licences pertain to him. His testimony further shows that driving licence Ex.R4 was got issued by him eight-nine years ago and it was got prepared by his present owner from Nagaland; whereas driving licence Ex.R2 was got prepared by his previous owner residing in Yamuna Nagar. 39. Ex.R2 was issued on 26.03.2010 and is valid till 25.06.2015. As per this driving licence, endorsement regarding heavy transport vehicle and heavy passenger vehicle was made on 26.06.2012. On the other hand, driving licence Ex.R4 was issued on 22.11.2010 and it is valid up to 21.11.2017 and it permits the holder to drive motorcycle, light motor vehicle and heavy motor vehicle. Thus, (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 12 of 17 Pages) Dt: 29.03.2016. MACP No. 04 of 2015 Shakal Dass & Anr. Vs. Jagir Singh & Ors. two driving licences have the common period from 22.11.2010 to 25.06.2015. 40.Learned counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 has drawn attention of this Tribunal towards Ex.R8, which is copy of 'No Objection Certificate' purported to be issued by office of DTO Phek, Nagaland, certifying the genuineness of the driving licence no. 55343/PK/Prof/10 i.e. Ex.R4. It is contended by learned counsel that if an owner employs the driver after satisfying that driver had a valid driving licence and is competent to drive the vehicle and accident is caused during the course of employment of the driver, then Insurance Company is liable to pay compensation. Reliance is placed upon Pepsu Road Transport Corporation Vs. National Insurance Company, 2013 (3) Apex Court Judgments 315 (SC), wherein, it was held that when an owner hires a driver, he has to satisfy that driver had valid driving licence and that owner cannot go to the extent of verifying the genuineness of the driving licence with the licensing authority and that Insurance Company is liable to pay compensation. 41.I am afraid that aforesaid contention raised by learned counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 has no merit and the authority cited by him is not applicable to the facts of the present case. 42.In this case, respondent no.2 i.e. owner of the offending vehicle has not entered the witness box to prove that when he hired respondent no.1 as driver and whether at the time of hiring, he had satisfied himself regarding the fact that said driver was having a valid driving licence. Apart from this, testimony of RW2 Jagir Singh, driver of the vehicle clearly makes it out that driving licence Ex.R4 was got prepared by his present owner from Nagaland. Both the driving licences Ex.R2 and Ex.R4, which have common period, have been issued by different authorities of Nagaland. It is despite the fact that respondent Jagir Singh never visited Nagaland nor ever resided thereat. (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 13 of 17 Pages) Dt: 29.03.2016. MACP No. 04 of 2015 Shakal Dass & Anr. Vs. Jagir Singh & Ors. 43.What is the effect of having two driving licences at the same time has been discussed by Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Bharat Kharbanda Vs. New India Assurance Co. Ltd., 2010 ACJ 1701, wherein, driver had two driving licenses, one for light motor vehicle and other for heavy transport vehicle. It was held by Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court that Motor Vehicles Act provides that only one driving licence can be possessed by a driver. Hon'ble National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, New Delhi in Jai Parkash Goyal Vs. United India Insurance Company Ltd., II (2010) CPJ 183 has also held that holding of two licenses is prohibited under law. In Shri Ram General Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Asha, 2014 (3) The Punjab Law Reporter 458 (P&H) , driver had two driving licenses. Driving licence held by driver at the time of fateful accident was a forged document. It was held by Hon'ble High Court that merely because the appellant later on came up with another driving licence in his name, does not mean that at the time of the accident, said driver - respondent was holding an effective driving licence. 44.Learned counsel for respondent - Insurance Company also pointed out that in written statement, it was no where pleaded that respondent - driver had two driving licenses. None of the witnesses were confronted that driver had two driving licenses. It is also pointed out that Ex.R2 is purported to have been issued by District Transport Officer, Tuenseng (Nagaland) and this is not at all proved that it is a valid driving licence. Learned counsel submitted that FIR No.73 dated 23.02.2012 had earlier been registered at Police Station Baldev Nagar, Ambala under sections 420/467/468/471 and 120-B IPC, as a racket had been unearthed, which used to issue forged driving licenses purportedly issued from Nagaland. 45.Section 6 (i) of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 clearly provides that no person while holding any driving licence for the time being in force, can hold any other driving licence except a learner's licence or a driving license issued in accordance with provisions of (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 14 of 17 Pages) Dt: 29.03.2016. MACP No. 04 of 2015 Shakal Dass & Anr. Vs. Jagir Singh & Ors. Section 18. The language of this section is clear that a person can have only one driving licence at one point of time. If any addition is to be made, same has to be endorsed in the same driving licence. As observed by Hon'ble High Court of Punjab and Haryana in Shri Ram General Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Asha and others (cited supra) that why a person would have two driving licenses? The reason is obvious - to hood-wink the law enforcement agencies - to use the particular driving licence in particular set of circumstances as per convenience of the user. 46.In view of the aforesaid factual and legal position, it is held that respondent no.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident. Though, on account of the fact that offending vehicle was insured at the time of accident, Insurance Company has to primarily satisfy the award, but it will have recovery rights against owner. As such, issue no.3 is decided against respondent N: 1 & 2 and in favour of respondent N: 3. ISSUE NO.4: 47.The offending vehicle is TATA Canter and as per testimony of RW1, neither Registration Certificate nor Route Permit of the said vehicle are attached with the police challan filed under section 173 Cr.P.C. Respondents no.1 and 2 have not produced Route Permit or Registration Certificate of the vehicle. Plying vehicle without Route Permit is certainly breach of terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy. 48.As such, it is held that offending vehicle was being driven by respondent no.1 at the time of accident in breach of terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy. As such, issue no.4 is decided in favour of respondent no.3 and against respondents no.1 and 2. ISSUE NO.5 (RELIEF): 49.In view of the findings on all the issues as above, the claim petition partly succeeds and is hereby allowed with costs in favour of (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 15 of 17 Pages) Dt: 29.03.2016. MACP No. 04 of 2015 Shakal Dass & Anr. Vs. Jagir Singh & Ors. petitioner no.2 Smt. Tara Devi alias Smt. Nagina Devi ( mother) only and against respondents. The claim petition qua petitioner no.1 Shakal Dass (father) stands rejected. Compensation of 5,93,000/- ₹is awarded to the petitioner no.2 Smt. Tara Devi alias Smt. Nagina Devi payable by the respondents jointly and severally together with costs; along with interest on award amount at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of institution of the petition till realization. It is held further that since the offending vehicle was duly insured with respondent no.3 at the relevant time, therefore, primary responsibility to pay compensation amount shall be that of Insurance Company i.e. respondent no.3 but it will have recovery rights against the driver and owner i.e. respondents no.1 and 2. 50. It is directed that 40% of the compensation amount along with proportionate interest shall be paid to petitioner no.2 Smt. Tara Devi alias Smt. Nagina Devi in cash; whereas remaining 60% of the amount along with proportionate interest is ordered to be deposited in a FDR in any nationalized bank in her name for a period of five years. 51. In order to facilitate the easy release of the amount to the petitioner Smt. Tara Devi alias Smt. Nagina, it is ordered that respondents no.1 & 2 / respondent no.3- insurance company shall deposit the amount directly in the name of petitioner no.2, either by way of account payee cheque or demand draft in the Tribunal. The petitioner no.2 Smt. Tara Devi alias Smt. Nagina will submit the details of her bank account directly to the insurance company under intimation to this tribunal and the cheque/ draft shall be released to the petitioner no.2 Smt. Tara Devi alias Smt. Nagina on an application for release of cheque/draft along with payment order in the name of concerned Manager with directions to disburse the amount as per Award and the details mentioned in payment order by Nazir, who shall submit a compliance report, which shall be made part of the main file. Ahlmad concerned is directed to check the strict compliance. (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 16 of 17 Pages) Dt: 29.03.2016. MACP No. 04 of 2015 Shakal Dass & Anr. Vs. Jagir Singh & Ors.

Mohinder Bindal, counsel for respondent no.3. J U D G E M E N T: This award will dispose of two petitions, as mentioned above, as they are arising out of the same accident and common question of law and fact is involved therein. 2)Brief facts of the claim petitions are that on 04.06.2014 at about 10.00 A.M. the deceased Himanshi alongwith her husband i.e. claimant was going to their village Mansurpur on motorcycle bearing No.HR-01-AH-1382 which was being driven by the claimant. At about 10.30 A.M. when they reached near Petrol Pump, Brahmin Majra turn, in the meantime a Maxi Cab bearing No.HR-37A-7005 being driven by respondent no.1 came from Ambala side in a rash and negligent manner Jagjit Singh, MACT Rajesh Kumar Vs. Gurnam Singh etc. 3 and at a very hish speed and hit the motorcycle after coming on the wrong side. Due to the accident, both the motorcyclists fell down on the road and sustained serious injuries. The injured were taken to M.M. Hospital, Mullana but due to serious condition the deceased was shifted to PGI, Chandigarh, where she died on 05.06.2014. Matter was reported to the police and FIR was got registered against the respondent no.1. Lastly, it was prayed that an amount of compensation to the tune of Rs.20,00,000/- be awarded on account of death of Himanshi alias Hema Rani and an amount of compensation to the tune of Rs.10,00,000/- be awarded to the claimant Rajesh Kumar on account of injuries sustained by him along with interest @ 18% per annum, from the date of filing of the petitions till its realization, for which respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation. . 3)The respondents no.1 and 2 being driver and owners of the offending vehicle filed their joint written statement and denied the averments made in the petition and stated that no accident took place with the vehicle of respondents. A false FIR was got registered against the respondent no.1 in-connivance with claimants and other witnesses. Remaining contents of the petition were denied and prayer to dismiss the petition was made. Jagjit Singh, MACT Rajesh Kumar Vs. Gurnam Singh etc. 4 4)Respondent No.3 Insurance Company contested the petition by filing separate joint written statement and it was submitted that driver of the offending vehicle/respondent No.1 was not having valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident and insured willfully violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. The factum of accident as alleged by the claimants in the petition was denied and submitted that a false FIR has been registered against respondent No.1 in collusion with the police. Also, the factum of rash and negligence of the offending vehicle was denied. Remaining contents of the petition were denied and prayer to dismiss the petition was made. 5)Replication was not filed. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed :- 1.Whether the accident in question causing death of Smt. Himanshi @ Hema Rani and for causing injuries to claimant Rajesh Kumar took place due to rash and negligent driving of Maxi Cab bearing registration No.HR-37A-7005 by respondent no.1, as alleged? OPP. 2.If issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation the petitioner is entitled to in both the claim petitions and from whom? OPP. 3.Whether the respondent no.3 is not liable to pay any compensation, in view of the preliminary objections raised in its written statement and whether there has been a breach of terms and conditions of the policy of insurance. If so, its effect? OPR-3 Jagjit Singh, MACT Rajesh Kumar Vs. Gurnam Singh etc. 5 4.Relief. 6) In support of his case, claimant himself appeared in the witness box as PW-1. Besides oral evidence, the following documents were placed on record:- Ex.PW-1/A :Affidavit of Rajesh Kumar Ex.P-1 to P-37 :Medical Bills Ex.P-38 :Copy of Order Ex.P-39 :Copy of Charge Sheet Ex.P-40 :Report u/s 173 Cr.P.C.

Gurnam Singh etc. 6 Ex.P-74 :Post Mortem Report Ex.P-78 :House Tax Register Thereafter, ld. Counsel for the petitioners closed the evidence. 7)On the other hand, the respondents have tendered the following documents: Ex.R-1 :Copy of D.L. Ex.R-2 :Copy of R.C. Ex.R-3 :Insurance Policy. Thereafter learned counsels closed the evidence of respondents. 8)No evidence in rebuttal was led by the petitioner. 9)I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the material placed on record. My issue-wise finding are given as under:- ISSUE No.1:- 10)The onus of proving this issue was on the petitioner and to prove the same, learned counsel for the petitioner argued that in the present case on 04.06.2014 the petitioner Rajesh Kumar alongwith his wife was going on his motorcycle and at about 10.30 A.M. at Brahman Majra turning a Maxi Cab bearing registration No.HR-37A-7005 driven Jagjit Singh, MACT Rajesh Kumar Vs. Gurnam Singh etc. 7 by respondent no.1 came from the side of Ambala in a rash and negligent manner and in high speed and without caring of the traffic rules struck against the motorcycle of the claimant, as a result of which his wife fell down and suffered serious injuries as also the claimant. The wife of the claimant was removed to the hospital but she expired on 05.06.2014 due to the injuries suffered in the accident. The petitioner was operated upon for the injuries suffered by him. The respondent no.1 is facing trial for the said accident and an FIR was got registered on the same day and the charge sheet against the accused is Ex.P-39 and the report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. is Ex.P-40. This has further been deposed by the petitioner in the witness box with no rebuttal from the part of the respondents. Thus, it is clearly proved regarding the accident in question having been caused by the respondent no.1 by driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. 11)Learned counsel for the respondent no.3 meanwhile argued that false claim petitions have been filed by the petitioner and he is not entitled to any compensation in the present case. 12)I have heard the counsels for the parties and perused the file carefully. 13)FIR placed on file dated 04.06.2014 got scribed by the Jagjit Singh, MACT Rajesh Kumar Vs. Gurnam Singh etc. 8 claimant Rajesh Kumar clearly explains about the accident in question by the vehicle driven by the respondent no.1 and it also mentions the name of the respondent no.1 as the driver of the offending vehicle, who as per charge sheet and report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. proved on file was facing the trial for the said accident. No rebuttal to this has come on the part of the respondents. Even otherwise, it is observed by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Smt. Surinder Kaur and others Versus Lakhbir Singh and another 2007(1) PLR 494 that; “F.I.R.-Being a public document is admissible in evidence as such and if no objection is raised at the time of production thereof, the same is to be read in evidence.” Similar view was held by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Bansi Yadav and another Versus Krishan Kumar and another 2004(3) ACC 758. Keeping in view the principle laid down in authorities (Supra), it becomes clear that the FIR being a public document and when not rebutted is to be considered as true. It is also important to note that the proceedings in MACT cases are of summary nature and the case is not to be proved like civil case where case is to be proved from the point of Jagjit Singh, MACT Rajesh Kumar Vs. Gurnam Singh etc. 9 preponderance of probabilities or in criminal case, where charge is to be proved beyond shadows of doubt. The FIR has been registered against the respondent no.1. So, in view of law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993(2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008(2) R.C.R. (civil) 774, it can be safely held that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle Maxi Cab bearing registration No.HR-37A-7005 by respondent no.1. Accordingly, issue no.1 is decided in favour of the petitioner. ISSUES No.2 AND 3:- 14)The onus of proving issue no.2 was on the petitioner while onus of proving issue no.3 was upon the respondent No.3. Finding of one issue shall have bearing on the other and hence the same are being decided together. To prove the above issues, learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the petitioner is the husband of the deceased Himanshi @ Hema and petitioner himself suffered serious injuries in the accident and thus, he is entitled to compensation in both the petitions. In support of his arguments learned counsel for the petitioner placed reliance upon the principles laid down in United India Insurance Co. vs. Parlad Rai, 2010(4) Civil Court Cases 528, Smt. Archana Jagjit Singh, MACT Rajesh Kumar Vs. Gurnam Singh etc. 10 Sandip Vs. Shri Dawoodsab Ladlesab, 2014(1) RCR (Civil) 551 and Jitendra Khimshankar Trivedi & Ors. Vs. Kasam Daud Kumbhar & Ors., 2015(2) Supreme Court Cases (Cri.) 601. 15)Learned counsel for respondent No.3 meanwhile argued that the petitioner is not entitled to any compensation for the death of Himanshi @ Hema since he is not dependent of the deceased as he has remarried and was also otherwise, not dependent upon any working of the deceased. With regard to his own injuries, he has not proved the bills on file as to who had prescribed the same and neither any treatment has been proved by any doctor. 16)Learned counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 meanwhile argued that although the accident in question is denied by them but still if the Tribunal comes to such conclusion, then the respondent no.1 holds a valid Driving License Ex.R-1 and the registration certificate of the vehicle driven is Ex.R-2 and insurance Policy is Ex.R-3 and it is respondent no.3 who is liable to pay the amount of compensation. 17)I have heard the learned counsels for the parties and have perused the case file carefully. 18)With regard to the injuries as suffered by the petitioner, the petitioner himself deposed in the witness box regarding the same and also Jagjit Singh, MACT Rajesh Kumar Vs. Gurnam Singh etc. 11 having spent an amount of Rs.3 lacs on his treatment. No doctor was however, examined to prove as to what treatment was required to be taken by the petitioner and what injuries were suffered by him. However, with the kind of bills produced on file and the deposition of the petitioner which is not rebutted in any manner, the petitioner is entitled to a sum of Rs.25,000/- for his medical expenses and a sum of Rs.10,000/- for pain and sufferings, died & nutrition, attendant charges etc. T he petitioner is also entitled to interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization. 19)With regard to the compensation sought for the death of Himanshi @ Hema to whom the petitioner was married at the time of her death, it is seen that as deposed by the petitioner he has since remarried and therefore, presently cannot be said to be dependent in any manner upon the deceased. The case laws (Supra) as cited by the learned counsel for the petitioner are distinguishable as they do not related to the cases where a person had remarried after the death of wife in the accident. Thus, the petitioner can at the most be entitled to compensation under Section 140 of the Act, in view of the principles laid down by the Hon’ble Andhra Pradesh High Court in P.Jonson Versus K.Presiasamy and others 2012 ACJ 155 that; Jagjit Singh, MACT Rajesh Kumar Vs. Gurnam Singh etc. 12 “Where claimant who was not dependent on the deceased is entitled to claim compensation from the owner and insurance company of the offending vehicle on account of death of the deceased-Held:yes; but claimant is only entitled to Rs.50,000/-, the statutory compensation provided for under Section 140.(2007 ACJ 1279( SC) relied)” Keeping in view the principle laid down in above cases the petitioner is only entitled to lump sum amount of Rs.50,000/- to which the present petitioner becomes entitled. Apart from this, he is also entitled to a sum of Rs.20,000/- for the cremation and last rites of the deceased. Besides this, the petitioner is also entitled to interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization. 20)With regard to the respondents liable to pay the amount of compensation, the petitioner has insurance policy of the vehicle driven by respondent no.1 and no violation of the terms and conditions of the same could be proved by the respondent no.3. The R.C. of the offending vehicle is Ex.P-2 and D.L. of respondent no.1 is Ex.P-1 and the insurance policy is Ex.R-3. Therefore, all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation. Accordingly, issue no.2 is Jagjit Singh, MACT Rajesh Kumar Vs. Gurnam Singh etc. 13 decided in favour of the petitioner, while issue no.3 is decided against the respondent No.3. ISSUE NO. 4 (RELIEF):- 21)Keeping in view of my detailed discussion on all the aforesaid issues, both the petitions are allowed with costs. The petitioner is entitled to compensation amount of Rs.35,000/- on account of injuries suffered by him and Rs.70,000/- on account of death of Himanshi @ Hema. Apart from this, the petitioner is also entitled for the interest of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization. Amount of compensation of award be given to petitioner by way of cash. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly. A copy of this judgment be placed in the connected file. File be consigned to record room after due compliance. Pronounced in open Court (JAGJIT SINGH) Dated: 03.10.2015 Motor Accident Claims Tribunal Ambala.

J U D G E M E N T: This claim petition under Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act for grant of compensation on account of injuries sustained in a Motor vehicle accident, has been filed by the claimant. Jagjit Singh, MACT Ashu Vs.Satish Chandra etc. 2 2)Brief facts of the claim petition are that in the intervening night of 09/10.04.2014, the inured was going on his Activa bearing registration No.HR-01AF-6106 towards Bus Stand, Ambala Cantt and his friend Mahesh Kumar @ Montu was pillion rider on the said Activa. Amrish Bansal and Ishu Kumar followed them on their motorcycle No.HR-01AG-5604. At about 12.30 A.M. when they reached near Sharma Studio Chowk, Ambala Cantt, in the meantime a Eicher Canter bearing registration No.PB-65G-1983 came from Indira Chowk being driven by respondent no.1 at a high speed and in a rash and negligent manner and hit the Activa. Due to the accident both the injured and Mahesh Kumar fell down on the road and received multiple and grievous injuries. The injured remained admitted in PGI, Chandigarh from 10.04.2014 to 22.04.2014. The claimant had spent more than Rs.2,00,000/- on his treatment, special diet etc. Matter was reported to the police and FIR No.153 dated 10.04.2014 was registered. The accident has taken place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. Lastly, it was prayed that compensation amount to the tune of Rs.10,00,000/- be awarded to him on account of injuries sustained by him along with interest @ 18% per annum, from the date of filing of the petition till its realization, for which respondents are jointly and severally Jagjit Singh, MACT Ashu Vs.Satish Chandra etc. 3 liable to pay the compensation. 3)The respondents no.1 and 2 did not appear despite service and hence, the respondents no.1 and 2 were proceeded exparte vide order dated 29.04.2015. 4)Respondent No.3 Insurance Company contested the petition by filing separate written statement and it was submitted that driver of the offending vehicle/respondent No.1 was not having valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident and insured willfully violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. The factum of accident as alleged by the claimant in the petition was denied and submitted that a false and manipulated FIR has been got registered by the claimant in collusion with the police. Also, the factum of rash and negligence of the offending vehicle was denied. Remaining contents of the petition were denied and prayer to dismiss the petition was made. 5)Replication was not filed. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed :- 1.Whether the accident in question causing injuries to the claimant Ashu took place due to rash and negligent driving of Eicher Canter bearing registration No.PB- 65G-1983 by respondent no.1, as alleged? OPP. 2.If issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation the claimant is entitled to and from whom? OPP. Jagjit Singh, MACT Ashu Vs.Satish Chandra etc. 4 3.Whether the insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation, in view of the preliminary objections raised in its written statement and whether there has been a breach of terms and conditions of the policy of insurance? OPR-3. 4.Relief. 6) In support of his case, claimant has examined Dr. Arun Kumar as PW-1 and claimant himself appeared in the witness box as PW- 2. Besides oral evidence, the following documents were placed on record:- Ex.PW-2/A :Affidavit of Ashu Ex.P-1 :Disability Certificate Ex.P-2 :Treatment record Ex.P-3 :Discharge & Follow UP Card Ex.P-4 :Out-Patient Card Ex.P-5 :FIR Ex.P-6 :Report U/s 173 Cr.P.C.

Counsel for the petitioner closed the evidence. 7)The respondent no.3 did not lead any evidence despite availing several effective opportunities. 8)No evidence in rebuttal was led by the petitioner. 9)I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the material placed on record. My issue-wise finding are given as under:- ISSUE No.1:- 10)The onus of proving this issue was on the petitioner and to prove the same, learned counsel for the petitioner argued that on the intervening night of 9/10.04.2014 the petitioner was driving his Activa Scooter on which Mahesh Kumar was the pillion rider followed by Amrish Bansal and Ishu Kumar on another motorcycle. At about 12.30 A.M. near Sharma Studio Chowk, a Eicher Canter bearing registration No.PB-65G-1983 came from Indira Chowk, Ambala Cantt driven by respondent no.1 in a rash and negligent manner and struck against the Activa resulting in fall of Mahesh Kumar, who suffered serious injuries in the accident. The respondent no.1 took the benefit of the gathering at the Jagjit Singh, MACT Ashu Vs.Satish Chandra etc. 6 spot and ran away leaving Canter at the spot. The injured were taken to the hospital where Mahesh Kumar was declared dead and the present petitioner suffered injuries including fracture on both legs and injuries in the ear and head and was referred to PGI. The respondent no.1 was facing trial for the said accident and the FIR Ex.P-5 was got registered immediately mentioning the number of the vehicle driven by respondent no.1, who had been charge sheeted under section 173 Cr.P.C. filed against him, which is Ex.P-6 and the charge framed against him is Ex.P-9. Earler for the death of Mahesh Kumar a separate petition had been filed and decided and resulted in compromise, which is Ex.P-10. This clearly proved the rash and negligent act of respondent no.1. 11)Learned counsel for the respondents meanwhile argued that no such accident ever took place and false claim petition has been filed by the petitioner. 12)I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the file carefully. 13)Compromise in related petition, Ex.P-10 goes to show admission of the respondent no.1 as well as the respondent no.3 with regard to the happening of the accident and the other documents on file including FIR Ex.P-5 and the charge sheet framed against the respondent Jagjit Singh, MACT Ashu Vs.Satish Chandra etc. 7 No.1 as Ex.P-9 go to show about the accident having occurred due to rash and negligent act of driving of his vehicle by the respondent no.1 and in the present case nothing came by way of any evidence to rebut the testimony of the petitioner. Even otherwise, it is observed by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Smt. Surinder Kaur and others Versus Lakhbir Singh and another 2007(1) PLR 494 that; “F.I.R.-Being a public document is admissible in evidence as such and if no objection is raised at the time of production thereof, the same is to be read in evidence.” Similar view was held by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Bansi Yadav and another Versus Krishan Kumar and another 2004(3) ACC 758. Keeping in view the principle laid down in authorities (Supra), it becomes clear that the FIR being a public document and when not rebutted is to be considered as true. It is also important to note that the proceedings in MACT cases are of summary nature and the case is not to be proved like civil case where case is to be proved from the point of preponderance of probabilities or in criminal case, where charge is to be proved beyond shadows of doubt. The FIR has been registered against the respondent Jagjit Singh, MACT Ashu Vs.Satish Chandra etc. 8 no.1. So, in view of law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993(2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008(2) R.C.R. (civil) 774, it can be safely held that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of Canter bearing registration No.PB-65G-1983 by respondent no.1. Accordingly, issue no.1 is decided in favour of the petitioner. ISSUES No.2 AND 3:- 14)The onus of proving issue no.2 was on the petitioner while onus of proving issue no.3 was upon the respondent No.3. Finding of one issue shall have bearing on the other and hence the same are being decided together. Learned counsel for the petitioner argued that in the accident in question the petitioner suffered serious injuries and disability of 5% and he had to spend huge amount on his treatment, the bills of which had been produced on file. The petitioner remained admitted in hospital for about 13 days and as a result is entitled to compensation accordingly. 15)Learned counsel for respondents meanwhile argued that a false claim has been put forward by the petitioner and as per the petitioner the accident took place on the intervening night of 9/10.04.2014 and petitioner was operated on 18.04.2014 but document Mark-E which Jagjit Singh, MACT Ashu Vs.Satish Chandra etc. 9 shows the articles purchased for the operation is dated 21.04.2014 and moreover, the disability certificate is although said to have been issued on 10.12.2014 but Dr. Arun Sharma as member of the board signed it on 10.06.2014. Thus, all the circumstances go to show about false claim petition field by the petitioner who does not become entitled to any compensation. 16)I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record carefully. 17)The petitioner as per document place on file i.e. Ex.P-3 shows to have been admitted in PGI, Chandigarh for about 13 days and he has also produced the medical bills and the disability as suffered by him was proved by doctor, PW-1. A minor dispute of date upon the same does not nullify the entire documents since the doctor appeared in the witness box and deposed in detail regarding the examination of the petitioner on 10.12.2014 and not on 10.06.2014, which is wrongly mentioned in the Certificate. The petitioner, however, failed to examine any doctor who has prescribed the medicines purchased by him but with the kind of treatment taken by him and the disability as suffered by him some amount is bound to have been spent by the petitioner on his treatment. As a result, for the medical expenses, the petitioner becomes Jagjit Singh, MACT Ashu Vs.Satish Chandra etc. 10 entitled to a sum of Rs.7000/- and for disability suffered a sum of Rs.10,000/- and for pain and sufferings, diet & nutrition, attendant charges etc., the petitioner is entitled to further sum of Rs.25,000/-. Apart from this, the petitioner is also entitled to interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petitions till actual realization. 18)With regard to respondents liable to pay the amount of compensation, the respondents no.1 and 2 failed to appear and contest the petition, whereas respondent no.3 does not dispute the vehicle in question having been insured with their company and copy of policy is placed on file. Thus, respondent No.1 being driver and respondent No.2 being owner and respondent No.3 being insurer, shall be jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation and respondent No.3 shall indemnify the insured. In view of above discussion, issue no.2 is decided in favour of the petitioner, while issue no.3 is decided against the respondents. ISSUE NO. 4(RELIEF):- 19) Keeping in view of my detailed discussion on all the aforesaid issues, the petition as filed by the petitioner is allowed with costs. Compensation amount of Rs.42,000/- is awarded to the petitioner on account of injuries suffered by him. The petitioner is also entitled for the interest of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual Jagjit Singh, MACT Ashu Vs.Satish Chandra etc. 11 realization. Amount of compensation be disbursed in favour of petitioner in cash against proper receipt and identification. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly and file be consigned to record room after due compliance.

Learned counsel for respondent no.3 also tendered in additional evidence documents i.e. final report under Section 173 CrPC as Ex.R10 filed in FIR no.180 dated 09.11.2014 under sections NARENDER SINGH VERSUS ROOP CHAND AND OTHERS -5- 279/337/338 IPC registered with Police Station Panjokhra, crime detail form as Ex.R11, registration certificate as Ex.R12 of motorcycle bearing registration no.HR-04-C-1716, insurance policy as Ex.R13, valid from 23.05.2014 to 22.05.2015, statement as Ex.R14 of EHC Hardeep Singh, under Section 161 CrPC, supplementary statement as Ex.P15 of Narender Singh. 8Arguments have been addressed by the learned counsels for the parties and the records have also been perused. My issue-wise findings are as under:- Issue no.1: 9In order to prove this issue, Narender Singh, PW1, the petitioner has deposed by way of affidavit, as Ex.PW1/A tendered in his examination-in-chief, reiterating the contents of petition. During cross examination, he has deposed that, registration number of tractor- trolley was noted by him on the spot. He has further deposed that, tractor- trolley was being reversed by its driver when the alleged accident had taken place. He has further deposed that, the accident had taken place on middle of Pucca portion of road and his motorcycle had hit left corner of back side of trolley attached to the tractor. Jaswinder Pal, PW4, the Criminal Ahlmed in the court of learned JMIC, Ambala, has deposed that case titled as “State versus Roop Chand” bearing FIR no.180 dated 09.11.2014, under Sections 279/337/338 IPC registered with Police Station Panjokhra, is pending in the court and same is fixed for NARENDER SINGH VERSUS ROOP CHAND AND OTHERS -6- 28.08.2015 for prosecution evidence. He has further deposed that, charge in this case has been framed against Roop Chand under Sections 279/337/338 IPC vide order dated 02.02.2015. It is true that there are discrepancies on record regarding registration number of motorcycle as well as manner in which accident had taken place; however, after investigations, it was concluded that aforesaid accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of tractor-trolley bearing registration no.HR-01-AE-9537 by respondent no.1, as is evident from final report under Section 173 CrPC as Ex.R10 and resultantly, challan was filed against the accused. Roop Chand @ Rupa, the respondent no.1 did not step into the witness box to rebut the evidence led by claimant. Learned counsel for the claimant has relied upon Raju & ors. Versus Sukhwinder Singh & ors. 2007(III) ACC page 254, wherein Hon' ble Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that “ driver of truck did not enter witness box to deny allegations of witness regarding his involvement in accident; adverse inference can be drawn against him. Further it is absolutely necessary to have the first hand report from the driver. It may be that the driver does not always speak the truth, but the driver's version is the one which is to be given the best consideration. He only knows as to what actually happened. Therefore, the driver having not been examined, necessarily, an adverse inference arises against him ”. Learned counsel for the petitioner has urged that, fact of registration of FIR no.180 dated 09.11.2014, under Sections 279/337 IPC with Police Station Panjokhra, NARENDER SINGH VERSUS ROOP CHAND AND OTHERS -7- as Ex.P1 coupled with testimony of Jaswinder Pal, PW4, is sufficient to arrive at the conclusion that, the accident in question causing injuries to Narender Singh, the petitioner had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of tractor-trolley bearing registration no.HR-01-AE- 9537 by Roop Chand @ Rupa, the respondent no.1. Learned counsel for the claimant has also placed reliance upon Gurdeep Kaur Versus Tarsem Singh 2008(2) RCR (Civil) page 775 wherein Hon' ble Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that “ if the driver is being tried on account of rash and negligent driving in a criminal case in a court of law, it is prima facie safe to hold that the accident occurred on account of his rash and negligent act. It is further held that in a claim petition under Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, the evidence should not be scrutinized in the manner as is done in a civil or in a criminal case. The proceedings before the Tribunal are of the nature of summary enquiry, whereas in a criminal case, the rule is of proof beyond reasonable doubt and in a civil case, the rule is of preponderance of probabilities. If there is some evidence before the claim Tribunal to prove a fact, no nicety, doubt or suspicion should weigh with it, in deciding a Motor Accident Claim case. It is further held that Tribunals established under the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 are not governed by the rules of procedure envisaged by the Civil Procedure Code and Tribunals are required to evolve their own procedure to meet the ends of justice, based on the principles of justice, equity and good conscience” . It is also held in Bimla Devi Versus NARENDER SINGH VERSUS ROOP CHAND AND OTHERS -8- Himachal Road Transport Corpn. And others AIR 2009 SC 2819 that “ it is not possible to give strict proof of accident by the claimants and they have to establish their case merely on touchstone of preponderance of probability”. The injuries suffered by Narender Singh, the petitioner stand proved from the discharge slip as Ex.P3 of Nandra Hospital, Ambala Cantt., placed on record as well as testimony of Dr Ashok Nandra, PW2. 10In view of the above discussion, it is proved that, Narender Singh, the petitioner had suffered injuries in the motor vehicular accident that had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of tractor- trolley bearing registration no.HR-01-AE-9537 by Roop Chand @ Rupa, the respondent no.1. Consequently, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents. Issue no.2: 11To ascertain the amount of compensation payable to Narender Singh, the claimant-petitioner, discussion is being made under following heads:- Medical expenses 12To prove this issue, Narender Singh, PW1, the petitioner has deposed by way of affidavit as Ex.PW1/A, tendered in his examination-in-chief reiterating the contents of petition. Dr Ashok Nandra, PW2 has deposed that, Narender Singh, son of Nasib Singh, resident of village Kalal Majra, District Ambala, was admitted in his NARENDER SINGH VERSUS ROOP CHAND AND OTHERS -9- hospital with history of suffering fracture/dislocation olecranon right side with multiple wounds. He has further deposed that, injured/patient was operated upon on 07.11.2014 and was discharged on 13.11.2014. He has further deposed that, he had charged Rs.35,000/- from the patient vide receipt as Ex.P14. He has further proved bill as Ex.P20 for Rs.4500/- regarding implant purchased for inserting in elbow. During cross- examination, he has denied that bill issued shows exaggerated amount. The petitioner has placed on record bills as Ex.P4 to as Ex.P20 evidencing expenditure to the tune of Rs.50,844/- incurred on his treatment; though, petitioner has claimed that he has spent more than Rs.90,000/- on his treatment etc. but in the absence of cogent evidence, same appears to be on higher side. Some bills might have not been taken in haste in a bid to provide quick medical treatment or the same might have been lost in managing the patient more than in caring for the details such as collection and retention of the bills. Taking into account, such natural and usual lapse as also human failing, the medical expenses are taken to be Rs.50,844/- rounded off to Rs.51,000/-. This amount is allowed to the petitioner as compensation for medical expenses. Reference can also be made to Smt. Parsanni Versus Shri Sube Singh and another 2011(2) PLR 764 (P&H), wherein it is held that “production of the bills relating to the purchase of medicines during the period of hospitalization and oral evidence given by the party about purchasing of medicines ought to be taken as sufficient proof of NARENDER SINGH VERSUS ROOP CHAND AND OTHERS -10- authentication and admissibility of these documents”. It is further held that “a hospital document produced by a party which is duly authenticated must be taken as sufficient proof of the documents themselves and the requirement to produce the doctor for mere production of hospital documents must be immediately given up”. Pain and suffering/disability 13The injured remained admitted in Nandra Hospital, Ambala Cantt., from 07.11.2014 to 13.11.2014 having history of fracture suffered in the said accident. Dr Vikas Paul, PW3 has deposed that on 03.06.2015, the injured was examined by the Medical Board to assess his disability and same was found to be 06% and has proved disability certificate as Ex.P21. During cross-examination, he has deposed that said disability can be reduced with physiotherapy. He has further deposed that, disability suffered will not affect the working capacity of petitioner in any manner. The provisions of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, make it clear that, the award must be just, which means that compensation should, to the extent possible, fully and adequately restore the claimant to the position prior to the accident. The object of awarding damages is to make good the loss suffered as a result of wrong done as far as money can do so, in a fair, reasonable and equitable manner. Thus, the compensation should be reasonably sufficient so that it equips the victim to return to his normal life to the maximum possible extent. It was a time of travail and trauma. The petitioner must have been confined to bed for sufficiently NARENDER SINGH VERSUS ROOP CHAND AND OTHERS -11- long time and life would not have been the same for him. Hence, by approximation a sum of Rs.5,000/- is awarded as compensation to the claimant under this head. Reference can be made to Sri Laxman @ Laxman Mourya Versus Divisional Manager, Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. & another 2012(1) TAC 376 (SC), wherein, it has been held that “efforts should always be made to award adequate compensation, not only for the physical injury and treatment, but also for pain, suffering and trauma caused due to accident ”. Nutritious Diet 14The injured/petitioner remained admitted in in Nandra Hospital, Ambala Cantt., from 07.11.2014 to 13.11.2014 having history of fracture suffered in the said accident and was also operated upon. Nutritious diet was required for early healing of wounds. One month's time is taken to be sufficient to come in routine for the injured. Taking charges for nutritious diet to be Rs.2,000/- per month, a sum of Rs.2,000/- is awarded as compensation to the injured/petitioner under this head. Attendant Charges 15The injured/petitioner had remained admitted in Nandra Hospital, Ambala Cantt., from 07.11.2014 to 13.11.2014. He must have required services of the attendant. At least one month's time was required to the injured to come in routine. Even if, he was helped by his family members, such support has commercial value. Taking attendant charges NARENDER SINGH VERSUS ROOP CHAND AND OTHERS -12- to be Rs.2,000/- for a month, a sum of Rs.2,000/- is allowed as compensation to the claimant-petitioner under this head. Transportation Charges 16 Narender Singh, the injured/petitioner is a resident of village Kalal Majra, Post Office Ganeshpur, District Ambala, and must have taken follow treatment from Nandra Hospital, Ambala Cantt. Hence, by approximation, a sum of Rs.2,000/- is allowed under this head. 17Compensation allowed to the claimant-petitioner Narender Singh put in a tabular form is given as below:- Sr. No.Nature Amount in Rupees 1.Medical Expenses 51,000-00 2.Pain and sufferings/disability 05,000-00 3.Nutritious diet 02,000-00 4.Attendant charges 02,000-00 5Transportation charges 02,000-00 ____________________________________________________ Total Rs. 62,000-00 Hence, issue no.2 is decided accordingly. Issue no. 3. 18Onus to prove this issue was on the respondent no.3. It is clear from the perusal of driving licence as Ex.R2 of Roop Chand, the respondent no.1 that he is licensed to drive vehicles i.e. tractor/ motorcycle/scooter(without-gear)/car/jeep/non-transport and same is valid NARENDER SINGH VERSUS ROOP CHAND AND OTHERS -13- upto 24.03.2029. Manoj Kumar, RW1, the driving licence clerk in the office of SDM (Licensing Authority/MV), Naraingarh, has deposed that Roop Chand is not authorized to drive goods/transport/commercial vehicle for which a separate endorsement is required. It is clear from perusal of evidence on record that, Roop Chand, the respondent no.1 was driving tractor-trolley at the time of alleged accident and thus, a tractor with trolley attached is a transport vehicle and requires a special endorsement and if there is no special endorsement, the respondent no.1 cannot be said to be duly authorized to drive the same. Reference can be made to Subhash Chand and others Versus Satya Rani and others 2013(2) The Punjab Law Reporter 329 (P&H) . Hence, in view of discussion made above, it is held that the respondent no.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident. Thus, as the Insurance Company, the respondent no.3 has been able to establish that Roop Chand, the respondent no.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident in question and as such has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy; accordingly, The Future Generali India Insurance Company Limited, the respondent no.3 stands absolved from its liability to pay compensation; however, in terms of law laid down in New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Versus Kamla and others 2001 ACJ 843 (SC), The Future Generali India Insurance Company Limited, the respondent no.3 is liable to pay the petitioner the amount of NARENDER SINGH VERSUS ROOP CHAND AND OTHERS -14- compensation as awarded firstly and can then recover the same from driver and owner, the respondents no.1 and 2, respectively. Hence this issue is disposed of accordingly. Issue no.4 (Relief) 19In view of the discussion made above, present claim petition is partly allowed with costs and a sum of Rs.62,000/- in all is awarded as compensation to the claimant-petitioner which shall be payable in cash. The petitioner is also held entitled to interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing the claim petition till realization. As the accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of tractor- trolley bearing registration no.HR-01-AE-9537 by Roop Chand, the respondent no.1; hence, the respondent no.1, being driver, the respondent no.2 being owner shall be jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the claimant; however, in view of findings on issue no.3, the respondent no.3 shall pay the compensation alongwith interest to the petitioner firstly and can thereafter recover the same from driver- and owner, the respondents no.1 and 2 respectively by filing execution petition under this award only. In order to facilitate easy release of the amount to the claimant, that too without intervention of the court, as per the directions of Hon' ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in FAO No. 465 of 2010 (O&M), it is ordered that the insurance company will deposit the amount directly in the name of the claimant, either by way of account payee cheque or demand draft in the tribunal, which shall be NARENDER SINGH VERSUS ROOP CHAND AND OTHERS -15- released to the claimant on proper identification. The claimant will submit the details of his bank account directly to the insurance company under intimation to this court and the cheque shall be released to the claimant on an application for release of cheque/draft alongwith payment order in the name of concerned Manager with directions to disburse the amount as per the details mentioned in payment order and send a compliance report, which should be made part of the main file and to check the strict compliance, a note be also given on the back side of the cheque or draft that the payment be made as per the details mentioned in the payment order. The Ahlmed is directed to issue necessary instructions at the relevant time. 20Counsel's fee is assessed at Rs.2200/-. Memo of cost be prepared. File be consigned to the record room after due compliance. ( Deepak Aggarwal), Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ambala. Note: All the 15 pages of this judgment have been checked and signed by me.

HRTC etc. 2 This claim petition under Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act for grant of compensation on account of death of Manpreet Singh @ Gaurav son of Hardeep Singh in a Motor vehicle accident, has been filed by the claimants. 2)Brief facts of the claim petitions are that on 30.12.2012 the deceased Manpreet Singh @ Gaurav was going from his village Daadlu to Ambala Cantt as a pillion rider alongwith another pillion rider Mohinder Singh on motorcycle bearing registration No.HR-07N-2713 being driven by Surjit Singh. At about 7.00 P.M. when after crossing Village Mohra, Tehsil and District Ambala, they reached near Partap Factory, they stopped the motorcycle to pass urine. Manpreet Singh @ Gaurav had gone towards Ambala Cantt. When Manpreet Singh @ Gaurav was standing in Kacha portion by the side of the road, in the meantime a bus of Baij Nath Depot HRTC bearing registration No.HP-53-8937 came from Shahbad side which was being driven by respondent no.3 rashly, negligently and in a zig-zag manner and hit the deceased. The deceased succumbed to the injuries on the spot. Matter was reported to the police and FIR was got registered against the respondent no.3. Lastly, it was prayed that an amount of compensation to the tune of Rs.40,00,000/- be awarded to the petitioners on account of death of Manpreet Singh @ Gaurav along with interest @ 18% per annum, from the date of filing of the petitions till its realization, for which respondents are jointly and Jagjit Singh, MACT Balwinder Kaur etc. Vs. HRTC etc. 3 severally liable to pay the compensation. . 3)The respondent No.1 being driver of the offending bus filed written statement and denied the averments made in the petition and stated that no accident took place due to negligent act of respondent no.3, however, a false and frivolous FIR was registered against the respondent no.3 just to fetch the claim. All other material averments were denied and lastly prayed for dismissal of the petition. 4)Respondent No.1 and 2 adopted the written statement filed on behalf of respondent no.3. 5)Replication was not filed. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed :- 1.Whether the accident in question causing death of Manpreet Singh @ Gaurav took place due to rash and negligent driving of bus bearing registration No.HP- 53-8937 by respondent no.1, as alleged? OPP. 2.If issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation the claimants are entitled to and from whom? OPP. 3.Relief. 6) In support of their case, claimant No.1 herself appeared in the witness box as PW-1 and also examined ASI Amar Singh as PW-2, Surjit Singh as PW-3, Sukhchain Singh as PW-4. Besides oral evidence, the following documents were placed on record:- Ex.P-1 :Post Mortem Report Jagjit Singh, MACT Balwinder Kaur etc. Vs. HRTC etc. 4 Ex.P-2 :Mechanical Report Ex.P-3 :Statement of Advocate Ex.P-4 :Copy of Order Ex.P-5 :Report U/s 173 Cr.P.C. Thereafter, ld. Counsel for the petitioners closed the evidence. 7)On the other hand, the respondent no.3 himself appeared in the witness box as RW-1. Besides oral evidence, the following documents were placed on record:- Ex.RW-1/A :Charge sheet Ex.RW-1/B :Complaint Mark PW3/DA :Copy of petition Mark PW3/DB :FIR Mark-A & B :Supplementary Statements Thereafter learned counsel closed the evidence of respondents. 8)No evidence in rebuttal was led by the petitioner. 9)I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the material placed on record. My issue-wise finding are given as under:- ISSUE No.1:- 10)The onus of proving this issue was on the petitioners and to prove the same, learned counsel for the petitioners argued that on Jagjit Singh, MACT Balwinder Kaur etc. Vs. HRTC etc. 5 30.12.2012 Surjit Singh was going to Ambala Cantt on motorcycle bearing No.HR-07N-2713 and Mohinder Singh and Manpreet Singh @ Gaurav were his pillion riders. At about 7.00 P.M. when they reached in the area of village Mohra, they stopped the motorcycle to pass urine and meanwhile a bus bearing No.HP-53-8937 came from the side of Shahbad driven by respondent no.3 in a rash and negligent manner and hit against Manpreet Singh, who received serious injuries and bus driver ran away from the spot alongwith his bus. Manpreet Singh succumbed to his injuries. Surjit Singh was under great shock of the death of his nephew and gave wrong registration number in his statement to the police as HP- 63-8397 instead of HP-54-8937 and remembered this on 31.12.2012 and got it corrected and also got his supplementary statement recorded. The respondent no.3 was facing trial for the said offence and report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. is Ex.P-5, charge against respondent no.3 is Ex.RW- 1/A and there is no representation by the respondent no.3 regarding his alleged false implication and this evidence clearly go to show the accident in question having been caused by the rash and negligent driving of his vehicle bearing No.HP-53-8937 by the respondent no.3 and causing of death of Manpreet Singh. It was argued that some minor discrepancies in the number of the bus in the FIR does not effect the case of the petitioners since on the next day the complainant got it corrected in the supplementary Jagjit Singh, MACT Balwinder Kaur etc. Vs. HRTC etc. 6 statement to the police. In support reliance was placed upon the principles laid down in Bhanwarlal Vs. Kabulsingh & Ors., 1989 ACJ 189, where it was held that “FIR is not a substantive piece of evidence – Its object is to set the criminal law in motion – Once FIR is lodged, it is the duty of the police to investigate the offence – It is not an encyclopedia where all the details can be given nor it is like a plaint in the civil suit, where the complete case has to be pleaded.” Reliance was also placed upon Dewakar Shukla & Ors. Vs. Ashok Thakur & Ors., 2007(2) ACC 833 , where it was held that “ One important point has also been brought to the notice by learned counsel for respondent that in first information report the number of vehicle is mentioned as MP20-E-9907 while cover note of insurance policy shows the number of the vehicle as MP20-C-9907. Therefore, on the basis of this mistake respondent no.3, Insurance Company is not liable for the payment of the compensation amount in this case. This appears to be a clerical mistake in writing the first information report, Ex.P1. The concerned vehicle MP20-C-9907 had been seized from the possession of respondent No.1. Respondent no.1 has been charge sheeted for the driving of this vehicle. Therefore, the aforesaid clerical mistake of wrong mentioned word 'E' instead of 'C' is no ground to disbelieve the appellants case. ” Similar view was held in Tulsabai & Anr. Vs. Sadhu Singh & Ors., Jagjit Singh, MACT Balwinder Kaur etc. Vs. HRTC etc. 7 2007(2) ACC 450 . Reliance was also placed upon Girdhari lal Vs. Radhey Shyam & Ors., 1993(2) PLR 109 , where it was held that “ Driver was being tried on account of rash and negligent driving – Prima facie safe to conclude that the accident occurred on account of rash and negligent driving of the driver.” 11) Learned counsel for the respondents meanwhile argued that a false claim petition has been filed by the petitioners and this was the reason that a wrong number of the bus was mentioned initially to the police. It is only after delay of one day that some other number of the present bus was mentioned and there is nothing on file as to how the complainant re-collected the exact number of the bus. The supplementary statement where the complainant says to have corrected the number is not proved on file and merely because the respondent no.3 was facing trial for the said accident was not itself sufficient to prove the case of the petitioners. It was argued that despite the fact that the contention of the petitioners is about bus No.HP-53-8937 having caused the accident, perusal of the charge sheet wherein charge against the respondent no.3 has been framed shows that it only relates to bus No.HP-53-8397 and not the bus alleged to have caused the accident. The claim petition however, is with regard to accident caused by bus No.HP-53-8937. Jagjit Singh, MACT Balwinder Kaur etc. Vs. HRTC etc. 8 One previous petition had been filed by the petitioners and the same related to bus No.HP-53-8397 and not the present bus and the said petition was withdrawn. The vehicle in the present case has only been taken into custody after a period of one month and why it took such a long time to take the bus into custody despite the vehicle properly identified is not clear. That the evidence on file also shows that there was no identification of the bus on the spot as in the statement of Surjit Singh to the police, Ex.RW-1/B it is clearly mentioned that after striking Manpreet Singh the bus driver took away his bus from the spot and did not stop there, whereas it is now the case of the petitioners that after the accident the bus had stopped at the spot and respondent no.3 alighted from the bus to look at injured Manpreet Singh. It was further argued that it was not put to the I.O. in his evidence as PW-2 as to how the complainant became aware about the number of the bus when initially he had got it recorded as HP-53-8397. It was argued that all these circumstances clearly shows that a false claim petition has been filed by the petitioners and the same, therefore, deserves to be dismissed. 12)I have heard the counsels for the parties and perused the file carefully. 13)In the present case it is the case of the petitioners that the accident was caused by respondent no.2 while driving his bus No.HP-53- Jagjit Singh, MACT Balwinder Kaur etc. Vs. HRTC etc. 9 8937 and due to shock when the number of the bus was initially mentioned to the police it was wrongly mentioned as HP-53-8397 instead of HP-53-8937 and there was only a mistake of one digit here and there. The complainant lateron when became aware on the next day about the mistake made by him, he got the number corrected to the police. The contention of the respondents is that no accident took place place with bus bearing No.HP-53-8937 which was being driven by the respondent no.3 and his bus has falsely been implicated in this case. It is important to note that there is only a difference of one number in the mentioning of the bus number where instead of 8937 the complainant initially mentioned it as 8397 and the respondent no.3 is facing trail in the case since 2012. Not a single representation has been made by him till date that he has falsely been implicated in this case and neither such an application has been given to the court where the trial is pending. It has been held in similar circumstances in Ranjit Kaur & Ors. Vs. Jai Pal Singh & Ors., 1989(2) ACC 627 , that “Accident – Denied by truck driver – Alleging false implication – Challaned under Section 304 I.P.C. - No report to higher authorities against false implication – Statement at variance with the plea put forth in his return – Plea of false implication rejected – Accident held took place due to rash and negligent driving of truck driver. ” Jagjit Singh, MACT Balwinder Kaur etc. Vs. HRTC etc. 10 14)On the other hand, it is clear that respondent no.3 is facing trial and merely because a digit of the number is wrongly mentioned in the charge sheet is not in itself sufficient to falsify the claim of the petitioners. The factum of wrong number due to mistake mentioned in the FIR and in the statement has also been dealt with in Banwar Lal's Case and Dewakar Shukla's case (Supra) where similar was the case. Some minor discrepancies as to whether bus stopped after accident or the driver ran away with the bus also do not effect the merits of the present petition. Thus, from the testimony of the petitioner, complainant, PW- 3, I.O. of the case PW-2, it was sufficient to prove that the accident in question was caused by the rash and negligent driving of his bus bearing No.HP-53-8937 by the respondent no.3. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUE No.2:- 15)The onus of proving this issue was on the petitioners and to prove the same learned counsel for the petitioners argued that the deceased was about 23 years old at the time of his death and he has left behind three dependents which included his parents and unmarried sister and he was working as Mason as deposed by PW-4 and was earning Rs.16,000/- per month. The petitioners are accordingly entitled to compensation. 16)Learned counsel for the respondents meanwhile argued that Jagjit Singh, MACT Balwinder Kaur etc. Vs. HRTC etc. 11 the petitioners father and sister cannot be considered as dependents upon him and no specific proof of income has come on record and PW-4 does not submit any document regarding deceased ever working as a Mason for him. 17)I have heard the learned counsels for the parties and have perused the case file carefully. 18)The deceased was said to be working as Mason but from the evidence on file this factum is not proved as PW-4 failed to produce any document regarding deceased ever having working as a Mason for him. With regard to the dependents of deceased, his father who is only 50 years old and his sister cannot be said to be dependents upon the deceased and only the mother of the deceased, petitioner no.1 is to be considered as dependent. The deceased in the year 2012 without any specific proof of income can said to be atleast earning Rs.6000/- even if he worked as a labourer and therefore, his annual income would come to Rs.72,000/- of which one half is to be deducted towards his personal living and expenses which comes to Rs.36,000/- and the remaining is also Rs.36,000/-. The deceased being unmarried, multiplier in the present case that would be apply would be that of the mother and who as per documents on file being 40 years old, multiplier that would be apply would be that of '15' and by applying the same, the amount comes to Rs.5,40,000/-. Alongwith this Jagjit Singh, MACT Balwinder Kaur etc. Vs. HRTC etc. 12 the petitioner no.1 would also be entitled to Rs.25,000/- for performing last rites of the deceased and the petitioner no.1 would further be entitled to a sum of Rs.50,000/- for loss of love and affection of her son. The petitioner no.1 would also become entitled to interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization. 19)With regard to respondents liable to pay the amount of compensation, the respondents no.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation. Accordingly, issue no.2 is decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUE NO. 4 (RELIEF):- 20)Keeping in view of my detailed discussion on all the aforesaid issues, the petition is allowed with costs. The petitioner no.1 is entitled to the amount of Rs.5,65,000/- as compensation, besides Rs.50,000/- on account of loss of love and affection of her son. The petitioner No.1 is is also entitled for the interest of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization. Amount of award be given to the petitioner No.1 by way of cash. The respondents No.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly and file be consigned to record room after due compliance.

The claimant no.1 is widow; claimants no.2 & 3 are minor daughters; claimant no.4 is mother and claimant no.5 is father of said deceased Jaswant Singh. 2.According to petitioners, on 06.12.2014, Jaswant Singh (now deceased) was coming from the side of village Sambhu Kalan and going to his village Suruh by driving his motorcycle Make Honda Twister bearing registration No. PB-11BL-7425 on correct left side of the road at moderate speed. At about 6.15 p.m., when he reached near fields of Hazura Singh of village Dhamauli, a Swift car bearing registration No. HR-01-AK-9802 (now offending vehicle), being driven by respondent no.2 rashly, negligently and at a very high speed, came from opposite side and struck against the motorcycle of deceased by going on extreme wrong side of the road. Due to impact, deceased fell down on the road along with his motorcycle and received serious head injuries, resulting in his death at the spot. The motorcycle of the deceased was also badly damaged. The deceased was taken to A.P.Jain Hospital, Rajpura, where post mortem was got conducted on 07.12.2014. On the statement of eye witness Gurmeet Singh, FIR No. 111 dated 07.12.2014 (copy Ex.P3) was got registered at Police Station Kheri Gandian under sections 279/427/304-A IPC against respondent no.2. 3.Further case of the claimants is that at the time of his death, deceased was a young boy of 25 years of age. He was doing private job with Hind Enterprises, By-pass Road, Sirhind getting 15,000/- per month.₹ It is also submitted that an amount of 50,000/- has ₹ been spent on the last rites of the deceased. His untimely death has (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 2 of 13 Pages) Dt: 04.02.2016. MACP No. 13 of 2015 Baljinder Kaur & Ors. Vs. Nirmal Singh & Ors. scattered the hopes of the claimants, who were dependent solely on the income of the deceased. The claimants have suffered great financial loss, as there is no other member in the family to earn livelihood because deceased was having two minor daughters and old aged parents besides his widow at the time of his death. With these averments, claimants claim compensation of 35 lacs against respondents, who are the respective driver, owner and₹ insurer of the offending vehicle. 4.Respondents no.1 and 2, in their joint written statement, took preliminary objections of maintainability; that petition is bad for non- joinder of necessary parties and that accident did not take place with the offending car. On merits, they denied involvement of the offending car in the alleged accident on 06.12.2014 by stating that a false case was registered against respondent no.2 by the police in connivance with the claimants to get compensation. The amount of compensation is alleged to be exaggerated. They further stated that claimants are not entitled to any compensation as accident took place due to own rash and negligent driving of deceased. If this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that accident took place on the alleged date due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.2, then respondent no.3 is liable to pay compensation as offending car was insured with it at the time of accident. Denying all other averments made in the petition, they prayed for dismissal of the petition. 5. Respondent no.3 i.e. Insurance Company, in its written statement, raised some customary precautions objections that claim petition is not maintainable; that respondent no.2 was not having a valid and effective driving licence and that offending vehicle was being driven in violation of the terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy at the (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 3 of 13 Pages) Dt: 04.02.2016. MACP No. 13 of 2015 Baljinder Kaur & Ors. Vs. Nirmal Singh & Ors. time of accident. On merits, denying the age, income, occupation, death, postmortem, spending amount on last rites of the deceased etc., it is pleaded that that no accident took place with the offending vehicle and a false and manipulated FIR was registered in connivance with the police and respondents no.1 and 2 just to get compensation from it. The amount claimed in the petition is alleged to be exaggerated and so, it is not liable to pay the same. With this stand and controverting other averments of the petition, prayer is made for dismissal of the same. 6. Following issues were framed for adjudication:- 1.Whether the accident in question took place by rash and negligent driving of Swift Car baring registration No. HR-01- AK-9802 by respondent no.2 Raj Kumar resulting into death of Shri jaswant Singh, as alleged ? OPP. 2.If issue no.1 is proved, whether the claimants are entitled to compensation, if so, how much and from whom? OPP. 3.Whether the respondent no.2 was not having a valid and effective driving license on the date of the accident, if so, its effect? OPR-3. 4.Whether respondent no.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy and respondent no.3 is not liable to indemnify respondent no.1 ? OPR (3). 5.Relief. 7.Parties have adduced evidence in order to support their respective stand. 8.I have heard arguments of learned counsel for the parties at length and have appraised evidence on record thoroughly and carefully. Findings on the various issues are as under:- (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 4 of 13 Pages) Dt: 04.02.2016. MACP No. 13 of 2015 Baljinder Kaur & Ors. Vs. Nirmal Singh & Ors. ISSUE NO.1: 9.In support of this issue, petitioners examined Shri Gurmeet Singh as PW2. He is an eye witness to the accident and author of the FIR. In his affidavit Ex.PW2/A, tendered as examination-in-chief, he testified about manner of the accident as disclosed in the petition. He has been cross-examined at length, but nothing could be elicited so as to disbelieve him. 10.Petitioners further placed on record copy of FIR Ex.P3, copy of challan filed by the police under section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex.P4 and post mortem report of the deceased as Ex.P2. 11.There is no rebuttal to the aforesaid evidence. The respondents failed to produce the driver of the offending vehicle i.e. respondent no.2 Raj Kumar so as to controvert the statement of PW2 Gurmeet Singh regarding manner of the accident or to prove the stand as taken by respondents in the written statement. This is sufficient to draw adverse inference against respondents that respondent no.2 i.e. driver of the offending vehicle entered the witness box, he could not withstand test of the cross-examination. 12.Apart from above, on the statement of PW2 Gurmeet Singh, FIR Ex.P3 was registered. Police investigated the matter and found respondent no.2 to be responsible for causing the accident due to his rash and negligent driving of the car No. HR-01-AK-9802, as evident from the report under section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex.P4 submitted in the court of learned JMIC, Rajpura. 13.In view of the aforesaid circumstances, there is no reason to disbelieve the unchallenged and unrebutted testimony of PW2. Relying on the same and other circumstances as stated above, it is held that (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 5 of 13 Pages) Dt: 04.02.2016. MACP No. 13 of 2015 Baljinder Kaur & Ors. Vs. Nirmal Singh & Ors. accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of car No. HR- 01-AK-9802, which was being driven by respondent no.2 at the relevant time and which resulted into death of Jaswant Singh. Issue no.1 is accordingly decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.2 : 14.In support of this issue, one of the claimants Baljinder Kaur, widow of deceased Jaswant Singh entered the witness box as PW1. After deposing about the accidental death of her husband, she deposed that deceased was 25 years of age and was getting 15,000/- per month as₹ salary by working in a company. She also deposed that all the claimants were dependent upon earnings of the deceased and that they also spent 50,000/- on the last rites of the deceased. During cross- ₹ examination, she disclosed that she is illiterate. Her deceased husband was uneducated. Her husband was not income tax payee. She has no proof regarding income of her husband or that he was doing any private job. 15.Petitioners also examined Manjeet Singh as PW3, who deposed that he is running a shop of unbreakable products at Bye-pass Road, Sirhind, District Fatehgarh Sahib (Punjab) for the last four-five years and that deceased Jaswant Singh was working with him as salesman, to whom, he was paying 10,000/- per month as salary. PW3 ₹ proved certificate Ex.P1 in this regard. During cross-examination, PW3 disclosed that his shop is not registered. He had not issued any appointment letter to the deceased. He is not income tax payee. He is not in possession of any documentary proof to show that deceased was being paid salary of 10,000/- per month. He admits that there is no ₹ reference number of stamp or stamp on Ex.P1. He is not maintaining any ledger book, receipts etc. regarding doing his business. No account (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 6 of 13 Pages) Dt: 04.02.2016. MACP No. 13 of 2015 Baljinder Kaur & Ors. Vs. Nirmal Singh & Ors. regarding loss and profit is being maintained by him. 16.It is evident from the testimony of PW1 and PW3 that there is no cogent proof regarding earnings of the deceased. Though it was claimed in the petition that deceased was getting 15,000/- per moth as ₹ salary, which is also stated by PW1, but this version is contradicted by PW3, who says that deceased was being paid 10,000/- per month as ₹ salary. Even this version of PW3 is not believable in the absence of any cogent and credit worthy evidence because PW3 is not maintaining any ledger to show income and expenses of his business. No appointment letter was issued. There is absolutely no document to reveal that deceased was being paid 10,000/- per month as salary. ₹ 17.In the aforesaid circumstances, notional income of the deceased will have to be taken into consideration by this Tribunal. Considering the fact that deceased was a young man of just 25-27 years of age, it can be assumed that he must be earning at least 8000/- per ₹ month i.e. 96,000/- per annum. ₹ 18. The deceased had a family of six i.e. he himself, wife Baljinder Kaur, two minor daughters; and parents. Considering number of the family members, who were dependent upon him, it will be proper to deduct 1/4th of the income for personal and living expenses of the deceased. Reliance in this regard can be placed on Puttamma vs. Narayana Reddy 2014 (1) RCR (Civil) 443, wherein Hon'ble Supreme Court held that deduction towards personal and living expenses of the deceased should be 1/3rd, where the number of dependent family members is two to three; 1/4th where the number of dependent family members is four to six; and 1/5th, where the number of dependent family members exceeds six. (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 7 of 13 Pages) Dt: 04.02.2016. MACP No. 13 of 2015 Baljinder Kaur & Ors. Vs. Nirmal Singh & Ors. 19.In the present case, as the dependent family members of the deceased are five, therefore, deduction towards personal and living expenses of the deceased is taken to be 1/4th. 20.By deducting 1/4th of the earnings for the personal and living expenses of the deceased, dependency of the petitioners works out to ₹72,000/- per annum. 21.As far as age of the deceased is concerned, petitioners have claimed age of the deceased to be 25 years. In the post mortem report Ex.P2, age of the deceased is mentioned to be 27 years. Besides this, photocopy of the ration card of the claimants is available on file, though not exhibited, which reveals that it was prepared in 2012 and in this ration card, age of the deceased is mentioned to be 25 years, which means that in 2014, when the accidental death of Jaswant Singh took place, he was 27 years of age. Keeping in view the said age of the deceased Jaswant Singh, proper multiplier in this case is held to be '17' by taking cue from the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court rendered in Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another 2009 (3) RCR ( Civil) 77. 22. Learned counsel for petitioners has also contended that addition to the income towards future prospects is also required to be made to the extent 50% in this case considering the young age of the deceased. For this, learned counsel relied upon Suman Vs. Ram Bhaj, 2014 (2) RCR (Civil) 806. In that case, deceased was working with Reliance General Insurance Company at the time of accident and getting 20,000/- per month as salary. Keeping in account that fact, Hon'ble₹ Punjab & Haryana High Court held that addition to the income for future prospects is required to be made in a case even where the deceased was self employed or was employed on fixed wages. (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 8 of 13 Pages) Dt: 04.02.2016. MACP No. 13 of 2015 Baljinder Kaur & Ors. Vs. Nirmal Singh & Ors. 23.Facts of the instant case are distinguishable because in this case, as has been found that there is no cogent evidence regarding income of the deceased or that whether he was self employed etc. His income has been assumed on the notional basis. In these circumstances, I am of the view that no amount can be added in his income towards future prospects. 24.In view of the aforesaid discussion, compensation payable to the petitioners works out to 72,000 x 17 = ₹ ₹12,24,000/-. 25. Coming to the funeral expenses of deceased, there is no cogent evidence to prove the actual expenses incurred for this purpose. However, the head “funeral Expenses” does not mean the fee paid in the crematorium or fee paid for the use of space in the cemetery. There are many other expenses in connection with funeral and, if the deceased is follower of any particular religion, there are several religious practices and conventions pursuant to death in a family. All those are quite expensive. Besides this, in legal parlance, 'consortium' is the right of the spouse to the company, care, help, comfort, guidance, society, solace, affection and sexual relations with his or her mate. The loss of companionship, love, care and protection, etc., the spouse is entitled to get, has to be compensated appropriately. Reference in this regard may be made to the observations in Rajesh Singh and others Versus Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (4) Law Herald (Supreme Court) 3006, where amount of at least one lakh for loss of consortium ₹ was held to be just and reasonable and amount of at least 25,000/₹- was held to be just, fair and equitable, under the head of “Funeral Expenses” , in the absence of evidence to the contrary for higher expenses. 26.Relying on Rajesh Singh Versus Rajbir Singh (cited supra), an amount of one lakh₹ for loss of consortium is allowed to (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 9 of 13 Pages) Dt: 04.02.2016. MACP No. 13 of 2015 Baljinder Kaur & Ors. Vs. Nirmal Singh & Ors. claimant Baljinder Kaur – widow and another amount of 25,000/₹- is allowed, under the head of “Funeral Expenses” 27.Apart from above, deceased Jaswant Singh left behind two minor daughters i.e. claimants no.2 and 3, who are just four years and four months old respectively. These minor daughters have been deprived of the love and affection of their father forever. Similarly, claimants no.4 and 5 are the old aged parents of the deceased, who have also been deprived of the love, affection and support of their deceased son in their old age. 28.Having regard to the above facts, an amount of 1 lac each₹ is allowed to compensate claimants no.2 and 3 for loss of love and affection of their father. An amount of 51,000/- ₹ is allowed as compensation to claimants no.4 and 5 for loss of love & affection and support of their deceased son 29. On account of above discussion, total compensation amount payable to the petitioners works out to 16,00,000/- ₹under various heads as per following details:- Sr. No. Head of compensation Amount. 1. Loss of Dependency. ₹ 12,24,000-00 2. Loss of consortium and companionship to petitioner no.1 Baljinder Kaur-widow. 1,00,₹000-00 3.Funeral Expenses ₹ 25,000-00 4.Loss of Love and affection to petitioners no.2 and 3 (1,00,000/- each) 2,00,000-00₹ 5.Loss of Love & affection and support to petitioners no.4 and 5. 51,000-00 ₹ Total ₹16,00,000-00 30.Ex.R1/ Ex.R4 is copy of the Insurance Policy revealing that offending vehicle was insured w.e.f. 09.06.2014 to 08.06.2015 by (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 10 of 13 Pages) Dt: 04.02.2016. MACP No. 13 of 2015 Baljinder Kaur & Ors. Vs. Nirmal Singh & Ors. respondent no.3 in the name of respondent no.1. Said period covers the date of accident. 31.As such, it is held that petitioners are entitled to compensation of 16,00,000/-,₹ which is payable jointly and severally by all the three respondents. Issue no.2 is decided accordingly. ISSUES NO.3 & 4 : 32.Ex.R2 is copy of driving licence of respondent N: 2-driver; and Ex.R3 is copy of Registration Certificate of offending vehicle. There is no evidence on the part of respondent no.3 i.e. Insurance Company to prove that any of these documents are fake or ineffective for any reason whatsoever. 33.As such, it is held that respondent no.3 has failed to prove that that respondent no.2 was not holding a valid and effective driving license at the time of the accident; or that respondent no.1 violated any of the terms and conditions of Insurance Policy. As such, both these issues are decided against respondent no.3. ISSUE NO.5 (RELIEF): 34.In view of the findings on all the issues as above, the claim petition partly succeeds and is hereby allowed with costs in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. Compensation of 16,00,000/- ₹is awarded to the claimants payable by the respondents jointly and severally together with costs; and interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of institution of the petition till realization. 35.Taking into account the relationship of the petitioners with the deceased; and the probable life span of the petitioners, it is directed that compensation amount along with proportionate interests, awarded (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 11 of 13 Pages) Dt: 04.02.2016.

Shri Balbir Singh, Counsel for the respondent No.1. Shri R.K.Vig, Counsel for the respondent No.2. AWARD:- This award shall dispose of two claim petitions No.06/MACT of 2015 titled as Sohan Lal Vs. Janak Raj & Another (hereinafter referred to as “First Petition”); claim petition No.07/MACT of 2015 titled as Sahab Singh Vs Janak Raj & Another (hereinafter referred to as “Second Petition”). Both the claim petitions have been preferred relating to one accident, out of them, first petition is for grant of compensation of Rs. 30,00,000/- on account of injuries suffered by claimant Sohan Lal and second petition is for grant of compensation of Rs.30,00,000/- on account of injuries suffered by claimant Sahab Singh, i n motor vehicular accident on 30.10.2014, which was allegedly caused due to rash and negligent driving of Truck bearing Registration No. HR-37-A-7707 by Janak Raj respondent No.1. At the relevant time, the vehicle in question was owned by the respondent no. 1 and was insured with the respondent no.2. 2The relevant facts leading to the claim petitions are that on 30.10.2014, Sohan Lal along with pillion riders Sahab Singh and Suresh SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 3 Kumar were going from Grain Market Ambala, to the house in village Saunti, while driving Motorcycle at slow speed and on the left side of the road. At about 10.00 PM, when they had gone little ahead from Thol Chowk, in the mean time, a truck bearing registration No. HR-37-A-7707 came at fast speed from Ismailabad side and while it was in the process of over taking, a canter came on the wrong side of the road and struck against their motorcycle. The truck was being driven by its driver at fast speed and in a rash and negligent manner by respondent No.1, resulting into causing serious injuries to claimant and others. They were taken to Government Hospital Ambala, from where both the claimants were referred to PGI Chandigarh. After causing the accident, respondent No.1 ran away from the side of accident leaving his truck at the spot. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing registration No. HR-37-A-7707 by respondent No.1. First claimant- Injured Sohan Lal remained admitted in PGI from 30.10.2014 to 08.12.2014 and has become permanently disabled. He spent Rs. three lac on his treatment and has spent Rs.50,000/- on transportation and special diet etc. He is earning Rs.15,000/- per month by doing the work of account and farming in Anaj Mandi Ambala City. Due to this accident, claimant will not be able to do his job throughout his life and has become totally disabled and handicapped. Prior to the accident, he was hale and hearty and due to his disability, he is dependent upon others for his livelihood. The accident took place due to sole rash and negligence of driver of Offending Truck bearing Registration No. HR-37-A-7707 . SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 4 3The second claim petition reveals the similar facts of accident as already elaborated and so far as her injuries are concerned; it is pleaded that soon after the accident, injured Sahab Singh was taken to General Hospital, Ambala City, from where, he was referred to PGI Chandigarh Cantt, where he remained admitted from 31.10.2014 to 10.11.2014. He has become 85 % permanent disabled. His right leg was amputated. He spent Rs.5,00,000/- on his treatment, medicines, transportation and diet etc. He cannot walk properly without the help of crutches. He feels great difficulty in climbing stairs etc. His working capacity has been diminished due to this accident . On the basis of statement of Sohan Lal, FIR No. 134 dated 31.10.2014 under section 279, 337 of IPC was registered in Police Station, Ismailabad, District Kurukshetra against the respondent No.1. Hence, both claim petitions have been filed with prayer that respondents are liable jointly and severally to pay compensation. 4Notice of these petitions were given to the respondents. The respondent no.1 filed written statement controverting the assertions made in the petitions. He took some preliminary objections like maintainability; claim petitions are bad for non joinder and mis joinder of necessary parties;; that the claimants have no cause of action or locus standi to file the petitions; that the claimants are estopped by their own act and conduct from filing the present petitions. On merit, it has been submitted that no accident had been occurred by the answering respondent with his vehicle on the alleged date, time and place. As a matter of fact, answering respondent and his vehicle have been wrongly implicated in said false FIR SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 5 by the police colluded with the claimants, therefore, the claimants are not entitled to any compensation and no liability can be imposed on answering respondent. Rest of averments made in the petition are denied with a prayer for dismissal of both the claim petition with costs. 5The respondent No. 2 insurance company filed separate written statement controverting the assertions made in the petition and took some preliminary objections regarding maintainability, cause of action; that the claim petitions are hit by the principles of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence; that the petitions are bad for non joinder of necessary parties and mis joinder of parties; that there is no insurable interest between insurer and insured; that the person driving the Truck No. HR- 37-A-7707 was not having a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the accident in violation of the terms and conditions of the alleged insurance policy; that the respondent reserves its right to take all defences and pleas available under section 148, 149 (2), 167,169 and 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and in terms of the insurance policy. On merit, it has been submitted that no record regarding alleged, occupation and income of the claimants has been placed on record. It is denied that claimants suffered serious and grievous injuries due to this accident and they remained admitted in any hospital due to th injuries suffered in the alleged accident and spent such huge amount on their medical treatment, transportation etc. The truck bearing registration No. HR-37-A-7707 was never involved in any accident, however, the insurance particular of the vehicle in question has not been verified from the issuing authority so SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 6 same is not admitted, but the liability of the insurance company, if any, subject to the provisions of the M.V . Act and also terms and conditions thereof. The amount claimed as compensation is much more exaggerated and imaginary one. It is denied that the claimants suffered serious and grievous injuries due to this accident and they remained admitted in any hospital due to the injuries suffered in the alleged accident. The actual cause of alleged accident has been suppressed; as such the answering respondent is not liable in any manner. The claim claimants have been filed after due consultation just to get compensation from the answering respondent on purely made up basis which is not sustainable in the eyes of law, so the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. Rests of facts are denied and prayed for dismissal the petitions with special costs. 6Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following consolidated issues are framed vide order dated 14.05.2015:- 1.Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent of the respondent No.1 while driving Truck bearing Number HR-37-A-7707 resulting into causing injuries to Sohan Lal and Sahab Singh, as alleged? OPP. 2If Issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom, the claimants are entitled to ? OPP. 3Whether petitions are not maintainable in the present form ? OPR 4Whether the claimants have no cause of action or locus standi to file the present petitions ? OPR 5Whether the petitioners have not come to the court with clean hands and have suppressed true and SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 7 material facts from the court ? OPR 6Whether respondent No.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect ? OPR 7Whether petitions are bad for mis joinder and non joinder of necessary parties ? OPR 8Whether respondent No.2 is entitled to take all the defences available to it under the M.V .Act ? OPR 9Relief. 7 To establish their claim, petitioners-claimants examined Sohan Lal {First claimant} as PW1, who tendered affidavit Ex.PW1/A reiterating the averments of petition.

He proved the disability certificate as Ex.P3, which was signed by him and other members of the board. In cross-examination, he answered that prior to issuing disability certificate, patient was treated by him one time. The patient had applied for his disability on 11.03.2015 and Board has issued the same on 06.05.2015. The disability assessed by the Board is of particular limb only. The board had issued disability on the basis of guidelines of Haryana Govt. from time to time. PW4 Dr. Harsh Vardhan , Senior Resident, PGI Chandigarh, deposed that patients namely Sohan Lal and Sahab Singh were admitted in PGI Chandigarh vide CR No.2014 as a case of Road side SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 9 accident. Patient Sohan Lal was discharged on 8.12.2014 as per discharge card Ex.P2, whereas patient Sahab Singh was discharged on 10.11.2014 vide discharge card Ex.P4.

PW5, Ramesh Lal {Criminal Ahlmad in the court of Ms. Rajni Kaushal, JMIC Pehowa, District, Kurukshetra} has produced the summoned record pertaining to case titled as State Vs Janak Raj, FIR No.134 dated 31.10.2014, u/s 279, 337, 338 IPC PS Ismailabad and the case was adjourned to 02.12.2015 for prosecution evidence. He has proved the copy of challan as Ex.P5, copy of charge sheet as Ex.P6; certified copy of site plan as Ex.P7, Mechanical report of Vehicle No. HR-01-P-3991 as Ex.P8 and mechanical report of HR-37-A-7707 as Ex.P9. The vehicle No. HR-37-A-7707 was taken into possession by the police and same was released on superdari to its original owner vide order dated 3.11.2014. In cross-examination he answered that route SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 10 permit of truck No.HR37A-7707 was not on the file. He has proved the copy of RC of vehicle No. HR-37-A-7707 as Ex.R1 DL of Janak Raj as Ex.R2 and copy of fitness certificate of vehicle No.HR-37-A-7707 as Ex.R3. Thereafter, learned counsel for claimants tendered documents i.e medical bills of Sahib Singh as Ex.P10 to Ex.P32 and medical bills of Sohan Lal as Ex.P33 to Ex.P107 and closed the evidence of the claimants vide his separately recorded statement. On the other hand, respondent No.2 tendered copy of insurance policy as Ex.R4 and t heir evidence was closed on 14.01.2016. No rebuttal evidence was led and learned counsel for the claimants closed the rebuttal evidence vide recorded statement dated 14.01.2016. 8I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1 : 9 Under this issue, petitioners- claimants are required to prove the fact that motor vehicular accident was occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Respondent no.1, while driving truck bearing Number HR-37-A-7707, resulting into causing injuries to Sohan Lal and Sahab Singh and as such the claimants are entitled to appropriate compensation from respondents. 10Learned counsel for the petitioners-claimants has argued that since accident in question was taken place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1 resulting causing injuries to Sohan Lal and Sahab Singh and offending vehicle is insured with SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 11 respondent no.2, therefore, respondent No.1 and respondent No.2 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. Learned counsel for claimants has further contended that vehicle in question was very much involved in the alleged accident and insured with respondent no.2. He urged for allowing the instant petition. 11 On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent no.1 has argued that no such accident, as alleged, was ever taken place with the involvement of offending vehicle, rather, False FIR was lodged against the respondent No.1, therefore, no negligence could be attributed to the respondent No.1 and in this view of the matter, no liability could be fastened upon the respondent no.1. He further urged that vehicle was insured with respondent no.2 and so owner of vehicle did not breach any condition of policy, therefore, insurance company has to indemnify the insured and as such both petitions are liable to be dismissed qua respondent no. 1 being devoid of merits. 12 Learned counsel for respondent No.2 has argued that FIR was registered against respondent No.1 only after due manipulation in collusion with each other just to shift undue burden upon the insurance company. He further argued that no accident was taken place with the offending vehicle belonging to respondent No.1, rather, Sohan Lal and Sahab Singh sustained injuries due to the fault of Sahab Singh as he was riding accidental motorcycle carrying three occupants against statutory rules or without caring traffic rules and so if accident is admitted, even then, sahib Singh can not be spared from contributory liability . He further SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 12 argued that respondent no.1 has breached the covenent of policy by non production of route permit and so insurance company is not liable to pay compensation and prayed for dismissal both petitions. 13I have given due regard to the rival contentions put forth by learned counsel for respective parties and have evaluated the entire oral evidence coupled with documentary evidence carefully. After thorough examination, it is observed that the petitioners-claimants have come to this Tribunal with categorical stand that the accident was taken place due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing Number HR-37-A-7707, resulting into causing injuries to Sohan Lal and Sahab Singh . In order to prove factum of accident, PW1 & PW2 {injured/eye witnesses} categorically stated through affidavits with regard to factum of accident, which was occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of truck bearing Number HR-37-A-7707 by respondent No.1. Further PW1 and PW2 being injured tendered affidavit EX.PW1/A and EX.PW2/A supporting the factum of accident. They were cross examined at length, but nothing adverse can be extracted disbelieving the factual position of motor vehicular accident. In this way, statement of PW1, PW2 being injured, can not be doubted from any angle regarding involvement of offending vehicle in the motor vehicular accident, particularly, when their statement are corroborated with documentary evidence like registration of FIR, copy of challan as Ex.P5, copy of charge sheet as Ex.P6; certified copy of site plan as Ex.P7, Mechanical report of Vehicle No. HR-01-P- 3991 as Ex.P8 and mechanical report of HR-37-A-7707 as Ex.P9. It SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 13 would be appropriate to point out here that despite availing opportunities, respondents failed to rebut the testimonies of claimants with regard to involvement of offending vehicle falsely in the said accident. Mere denial of rash and negligence at the behest of respondents after causing accident resulting causing injuries to two occupants of motor cycle, are not found sufficient at all disbelieving the factual position of accident. 14It is quite well settled that the lodging of the first information report is not an essential prerequisite for claiming compensation arising from a motor accident. Each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The Tribunal is expected to adjudge a case on the basis of the evidence produced without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled position of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. It must be remembered that in a motor accident claim, the claimants are not required to prove their case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. It is trite law that claimants-petitioners are required to prove its case, which sets up the particular case relating to the accident which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts upon the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way as alleged by the claimants. The provisions with regard to claim under the Act are enacted keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimants are always entitled for compensation irrespective whether the police has registered SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 14 the offence regarding the incident or not because no claim case can be left over on the mercy of the police. The evidence brought on record irrefutably leads to the inference in terms of unrebutted evidence at the instance of petitioners that there was taken place accident between motor cycle and ambulance van resulting causing injuries to claimants and death of driver of offending vehicle. In this way, it can be held that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of driver of offending vehicle. If rider Sahab Singh was riding motor cycle with two pillion riders against the statutory provision/ traffic rules, then he is liable to face punishment under traffic rules as per law. Accordingly, this issue no.1 is decided in favour of the claimants. ISSUE NO. 2: 15The onus to prove this issue is upon claimants. Learned counsel for claimants has submitted that offending vehicle was owned by respondent no.1 and was insured with respondent no.2, therefore, insurance company is liable to indemnify the insured and prayed for allowing petition. In support to his contention, he has placed reliance upon following authorities; In Arvind Kumar Mishra Vs. New India Assurance Co. Ltd and another, 2010 (4) RCR (Civil) 917 , it has been observed that Motor Accident- How to assess of earnings in respect of a victim who suffered 70% disablement:-Motor Accident due to rash and negligent driving of a truck driver- Claimant suffered 70% permanent disablement (right hand amputated, loss of vision of right eye) Victim was aged 25 years and a SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 15 brilliant student of Engineering with bright carrier- His earnings assessed at Rs.60,000/- per annum payable to Assistant Engineer in public employment- Since he suffered 70% permanent disability the future earnings may be discounted by 30% which came to Rs.42,000/- per annum- The operative multiplier would be 18. The loss of future earnings by multiplying the multiplicand of Rs.42,000/- by a multiplier of 18 comes to Rs.7,56,000/-. A sum of Rs.1.50 lacs awarded toward medical expenses- The total amount of compensation to which the appellant is entitled is Rs.9,06,000. It has been further observed that Award of compensation- Perfect compensation is hardly possible- However, Court must take care to give the victim full and fair compensation for that he had suffered- In some cases for personal injury, the cases for personal injury, the claim could be in respect of life time's earnings lost because, though, he will live, he cannot earn his living- In others, the claim may be made for partial loss of earnings- Each case has to be considered in the light of its own facts and at the end, one must ask whether the sum awarded is a fair and reasonable sum. In Raj Kumar Vs. Ajay Kumar and another, 2011 (1) ACC 1, it has been observed that Quantum injury- Principles of assessment- Determination of loss of future earnings of the injured with reference to extent of his permanent disablement explained- Principles enumerated and illustrations given. Principles are: (i)All injuries for permanent disabilities arising from injuries, SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 16 do not result in loss of earning capacity. (ii)The percentage of permanent disability with reference to the whole body of a person, cannot be assumed to be the percentage of loss of earning capacity. To put it differently, the percentage of loss of earning capacity is not the same as the percentage of permanent disability (except in a few cases, where the Tribunal on the basis of evidence, concludes that percentage of loss of earning capacity is the same as percentage of permanent disability). (iii)The doctor who treated an injured-claimant or who examined him subsequently to assess the extent of his permanent disability can give evidence only in regard to the extent of permanent disability. The loss of earning capacity is something that will have to be assessed by the Tribunal with reference to the evidence in entirety. (iv)The same permanent disability may result in different percentages of loss of earning capacity in different persons, depending upon the nature of profession, occupation or job, age, education and other factors. It has also been observed that Quantum- Injury- Principles of assessment- Personal expenses- Whether one-third or any other percentage may be deducted as personal or living expenses from income of the injured while computing his future loss of earnings- Held: No. In K. Suresh Vs. New India Assurance Co.Ltd. And another, 2012 ACJ 2694 , it has been observed that Quantum- Injury- Principles of assessment- Loss of earning power and permanent disability- Injured sustained injuries resulting in 40 per cent permanent disablement- SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 17 Tribunal awarded Rs.5,00,000 for loss of earning capacity and further Rs.3,00,000 towards permanent disablement-Appellate court allowed Rs.4,68,000 for loss of earning capacity and disallowed compensation for permanent disablement- Whether total deletion of compensation for permanent disablement is justified- Held: no, compensation can be granted under both heads. In Karnail Singh and others Vs. Balwinder Singh and another, 2013 (1) PLR 774 , it has been observed that three persons on a motorcycle having been hit by Maruti car coming from behind- The three persons traveling on a motorcycle may have been guilty of traffic offence but there is no reason for the Court to make any inference regarding negligence as contributory by the only fact that three persons were going on motorcycle. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents No.2 has vehemently argued that although offending vehicle was insured with policy EX.R4 but no route permit has been brought on record. He further argued that injured Sahib Singh was riding motor cycle with two pillion riders as admitted and so he is contributory liable to share as he was also driving the motorcycle in violation of the provisions of Motor Vehicles Act and prayed for dismissal the same. Learned counsel for respondents no.2 has placed reliance upon following case law:- In support to his contentions, learned counsel for respondent No.2 has placed reliance upon case law cited as Angrejo Devi and others Vs. Jai Parkash and Others, 2012 (4) PLR 604, wherein it has been observed that Negligence- Motor cycle is designed to ride two persons, if used by more than two SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 18 persons, then the driver will have to share part of his seat, he will not be able to control the vehicle effectively- Moreover, the weight on account of third passenger will affect its stability- was also driving the motorcycle in violation of the provisions of the M.V Act- Learned Tribunal has rightly come to the conclusion that it was a case of contributory negligence of the deceased in the ratio of 50% each. In Madan Lal Papneja Vs. State of Haryana and others, 2011 (1) PLR 61 , it has been observed that Disability may either be permanent or temporary- For permanent disability- which is capable of ascertainment in terms of percentage of functional disability of the particular organ of the body that is affected, the amount could be Rs.1000/- for every % of permanent disability and Rs.250/- for every % of temporary disability. In Kamala Mangalal Vayani and others Vs. M/s United India Insurance Company Ltd and others, 2010 (2) PLR 687 , it has been observed that Owner and driver proceeded ex parte- Failure of insurance company to prove that the vehicle had no permit- Insurance company held liable- Insured can proceed against the owner and recovering the amount paid by it so the claimants, in the event of the insurer being able to establish, in any suit it may choose to file against the owner, that there was violation or breach of the conditions of the insurance policy or that the vehicle was not covered by a permit on the date of the accident. 16Having due regard to the rival contentions put forth by counsel for the parties, it is observed that rider of motorcycle namely SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 19 Sohan Lal was riding accidental vehicle by violating the statutory provision of law as admitted and therefore this substantial fact can be taken into consideration for breach of traffic rules as per law as held in Karnail Singh and others Vs. Balwinder Singh and another, 2013 (1) PLR 774,. According to evidence, it can be gathered that injured Sohan Lal remained admitted as indoor patient w.e.f.31.10.2104 to 8.12.2014 and he spent total amount of Rs.1,57,211 { In round figure 1,57,300/-} as per medical bills EX.P33-EX.P106. He did not sustain any permanent disability and as such following assessment is made; Pecuniary damages (Special damages) (i).Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization in PGI, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and miscellaneous expenditure.RS.1,57,300/- medical expenses and Rs. 9000/- as indoor patient @ 1000/- per day including all expenses. (ii).Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising: (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment; (b) Loss of future earning on account of injuries etc. 5000/- nil (iii). Future medical expenses. 5000/- None-pecuniary damages (General damages) (iv). Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries. RS. 10 ,000/- (v). Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage). nil (vi).Loss of expectation of life ( shortening of normal longevity). Nil. Total Compensation Rs.,1,86,300/- SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 20 17In this way, petitioner-claimant Sohan Lal is held entitled to comenstaion amounting Rs.1,86,300/- along with interest @ 7.5% per annumfrom the date of filing of petition till realization of awarded amount, which is quite fair, reasonable and just compensation. Rests of relief sought by petitioner-claimant stands declined. 18 So far as second claimant Sahib Singh is concerned; it is evident that said Sahib Singh was hospitalized in PGI for a period from 31.10.2014 to 10.11.2014 as Indoor patient. PW3 Dr. Vikas Paul, proved the disability certificate as Ex.P3 showing his 83% permanent on account of amputation of right thigh and also stated that the disability assessed by the Board is of particular limb only. He relied bills Ex.P10 to Ex.P32 showing total expenses of Rs.52,313/-{ in round figure 52400/-} was being spent on his treatment. According to his version coupled with medical evidence, he suffered 83% physical permanent disability of particular limb and so In view of extent of physical disability and its nature when examined in the light of Judgment in Ram Kiran Goyal vs Sub Divisional engineer, mechanical and other 2008 {2} RCR {Civil}103, the claimant Sahib Singh is held entitled to Rs. 1,66,000/- @ 2,000/- per percent. 19In view of the law settled in Raj Kumar Vs Ajay Kumar, (2011)1 SCC 343 , the petitioner is held entitled to the following compensation: Pecuniary damages (Special damages) SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 21 46 percent permanent Physical injuries to particular limb; Rs. 1,66,000/- (i).Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization in PGI, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and miscellaneous expenditure.Rs.52300/- medical expenses and Rs. 11000/- as indoor patient @ 1000/- per day including all expenses. (ii).Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising: (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment; (b) Loss of future earning on account of injuries etc. 5000/- 50000/- (iii). Future medical expenses. 25000/- None-pecuniary damages (General damages) (iv). Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries. RS. 15 ,000/- (v). Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage). nil (vi).Loss of expectation of life ( shortening of normal longevity). Nil. Total Compensation Rs.,3,24,300/- 20 In this way, petitioner-claimant Sahib Singh is held entitled to comenstaion amounting Rs.3,24,300/- along with interest @ 7.5% per annumfrom the date of filing of petition till realization of awarded amount, which is quite fair, reasonable and just compensation. Rests of relief sought by petitioner-claimant stands declined. ISSUE NO.3 to 5, 7&8 : 21 The onus to prove these issues is upon Respondents but they neither pressed this issue nor led any evidence. However, it has already discussed in detail under Issue No.1 & 2 that accident was occurred due to SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 22 rash ad negligent driving of respondent no.1. In this way, it has become obvious on file that this tribunal has left with no other option except to decide these issues against Respondents. Accordingly, these issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.6: 22 Coming to question of liability where under onus to prove this issue is upon the respondent No.2, who is under the obligation to prove the fact that respondent No.1 was not holding valid driving licence to run offending vehicle at the day of alleged accident and as such he has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. 23However, there is nothing on record to show that respondent No.1, was not holding any valid license, rather same is proved as EX.R2 . Further Insurance Policy Ex.R4 reveals that offending vehicle as per RC EX.R1 in the name of respondent no.1 was insured with the respondent No.2 at the time of accident. The respondent no.1 has also furnished fitness certificate of offending vehicle as EX.R3 and so non production of route permit would not defeat right of respondent no.1 to indemnify the claim by respondent no.2. Resultantly, respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation as such respondent no.2 shall indemnify the claim. Accordingly, this Issue is decided against the respondent No.2. ISSUE NO.9 (RELIEF): BOTH Petitions succeed ; 24 In view of the foregoing discussion, both the claim petition are partly allowed with cost. Claimant-petitioner Sohan Lal is SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 23 entitled to compensation of Rs. 1,86,300/- along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this claim petition till the date of actual payment. The awarded compensation amount along with the interest shall be payable jointly and severally by respondent no. 1 and 2 and respondent no.2 insurance company shall indemnify the insured. In Second claim petition , claimant-petitioner Sahib Singh is entitled to compensation of Rs.3,24,300/- along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this claim petition till the date of actual payment. The awarded compensation amount along with the interest shall be payable jointly and severally by respondent no. 1 and 2 and respondent no.2 insurance company shall indemnify the insured. Remaining relief sought by both claimants stands declined. It is further made clear that 50 percent amount shall be deposited in FDR for three years in any Nationalized bank. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.3000/- each petition. Copy of this award be placed on the connected case file.

The case is remanded to the Tribunal for decision on the remaining issues for which purpose the parties may be given due opportunity to present their evidence. ” 3)Brief facts of the claim petition are that on 10.05.2003 at about 11.00 A.M., the deceased Rajinder Kumar alongwith his brother Mohan Lal boarded a three wheeler bearing No.HR-37A-8341 from Ambala Cantt for going to Ambala City. The other passengers were also travelling therein. The respondent no.1 was driving the three wheeler in a rash and negligent manner and at a very high speed. When they reached near GRP, Ambala Cantt, the respondent no.1 all of a sudden applied brakes, as a result of which the three wheeler turned turtle and the deceased, who was sitting on its left side, fell down and crushed under it. The deceased sustained injuries on his right shoulder, hand, knee, fracture in jaw, head injuries and succumbed to the injuries on the way to hospital. The said accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. Matter was reported to the police and FIR was got registered against the respondent no.1. Lastly, it was prayed that compensation amount to the tune of Rs.10,00,000/- be awarded to them Jagjit Singh, MACT Soni Devi etc. Vs. Mahesh Kumar etc. 4 on account of death of Rajinder Singh son of Ganga Ram along with interest @ 18% per annum, from the date of filing of the petition till its realization, for which respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation. 4)The respondents No.1 and 2, being driver and owner of the offending vehicle filed joint written statement and admitted the accident but it was denied that it has taken place due to rash and negligence driving of respondent no.1. It was pleaded that an army truck was going ahead of their three-wheeler and all of a sudden the said army vehicle applied brakes and in order to avoid accident, the respondent no.1 also applied brakes of the three-wheeler but it turned turtle and the deceased received injuries. 5)Respondent No.3 Insurance Company contested the petition by filing separate written statement and it was submitted that driver of the offending vehicle/respondent No.1 was not having valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident and insured willfully violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. The factum of accident as alleged by the claimants in the petition was denied and submitted that a false FIR has been registered against respondent No.1 in collusion with the police. Also, the factum of rash and negligence of the Jagjit Singh, MACT Soni Devi etc. Vs. Mahesh Kumar etc. 5 offending vehicle was denied. Remaining contents of the petition were denied and prayer to dismiss the petition was made. 6)Replication was not filed. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed :- 1.Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 while driving three-wheeler bearing No.HR-37A-8341? OPP. 2.If issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom the claimants are entitled to? OPP. 3.Whether claim petition is not maintainable? OPR 4.Whether respondent no.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident? OPR 5.Whether respondent no.2 is entitled to various defences available under the Act? OPR 6.Relief. 7) In support of their case, one of the claimant Anita Devi herself appeared in the witness box as PW-1 and also examined Mohan Lal as PW-2, Randhir Singh as PW-3, Rakesh as PW-4. Besides oral evidence, the following documents were placed on record:- Ex.P-1 :Copy of Ration Card Ex.P-2 :Copy of Death Certificate Jagjit Singh, MACT Soni Devi etc. Vs. Mahesh Kumar etc. 6 Ex.P-3 :D.L. of deceased Ex.P-4 :Post Mortem Report Ex.P-5 :Copy of FIR Ex.PC :I-Card Thereafter, ld. Counsel for the petitioner closed the evidence. 8)On the other hand, the respondent no.3 has examined Amit Mittal as RW-1 and M.L. Vaish as RW-2 . Besides oral evidence, following documents were place on record:- Ex.R-1 :Kalandra u/s 181 of M.V. Act Ex.R-2 :Copy of FIR Ex.R-3 :Certificate Ex.R-4 :Report of Investigator Ex.R-5 :Insurance Policy Mark R-D :Letter Mark R-E :Postal Receipt Mark R-F :Postal Status Mark R-G :Letter to Sudarshan Sood Mark R-H :Postal receipt Mark R-I :Postal Status Thereafter learned counsel closed the evidence of respondent Jagjit Singh, MACT Soni Devi etc. Vs. Mahesh Kumar etc. 7 no.3. 9)No evidence in rebuttal was led by the petitioner. 10)I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the material placed on record. My issue-wise finding are given as under:- ISSUE No.1:- 11)The onus of proving this issue was on the petitioners but keeping in view the findings of the Hon'ble High Court where it has been specifically held that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of three wheeler by respondent no.1 and that the deceased had died due to the said accident, the present issue is decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUES No.2, 3, 4 and 5:- 12) The onus of proving issue no.2 was on the petitioners while onus of proving issues no.3, 4 and 5 was upon the respondents. Finding of one issue shall have bearing on the other and hence the same are being decided together. 13) To prove the above issues, learned counsel for the petitioners argued that in the present case deceased Rajinder Kumar was working as driver of Auto Rickshaw and he himself owned an Auto Rickshaw. He was earning about Rs.10,000/- per month and has left behind three Jagjit Singh, MACT Soni Devi etc. Vs. Mahesh Kumar etc. 8 dependents which include his mother, his widow and one child. During pendency of the petition the mother has died and her LRs have been joined in the present petition. The deceased was about 32 years old at the time of said accident and the petitioners are accordingly entitled to compensation in the present case. 14) Learned counsel for respondent no.3 meanwhile argued that the present petition is not maintainable and neither the petitioners are entitled to any compensation. That the respondent no.1 of the present case did not hold driving license and same was also never produced on the file of the criminal case and neither at any stage by him. Now in the present petition, the respondents no.1 and 2 have proceeded exparte but the respondent no.3 cannot be burdened with the liability of paying compensation because of the fault of respondents no.1 and 2. Moreover, the deceased cannot be said to be earning Rs.10,000/- per month without any specific proof of the income and with regard to his age, as per the ration card produced on the file, he was shown as 35 years old and his wife as 30 years old in Ex.P-1 and lateron when the petition was filed, she was stated to be 34 years old, which would make the deceased who was 5 years elder to his wife as 39 years old at the time of his death. It was thus argued that the respondent no.3 be Jagjit Singh, MACT Soni Devi etc. Vs. Mahesh Kumar etc. 9 absolved in the present case and it is only respondents no.1 and 2 who are liable to pay the amount of compensation. In support of his arguments, learned counsel places reliance upon the principles laid down in Rajinder Puri Vs. Sandeep Singh (Minor) and Others, 2014(3) PLR 625 , where it was held that: “Driver of the vehicle did not have a licence at all – There being a violation or contravention of the terms and conditions of insurance policy, Insurance Company has rightly been absolved or exonerated from its liability to make the payment of the compensation so awarded by the Tribunal.” Similar view was held in The New India Assurance Company Limited & Others Vs. Dayal Singh & Others, 2010(4) PLR 300 and New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Manu Krishna & Others, 2011 ACJ 466. 15) I have heard the learned counsels for the parties and have perused the case file carefully. 16) In the present case the claimants are wife, children and LRs of mother of deceased, who was originally the claimant in the present petition. The deceased in the present case was working as driver since Jagjit Singh, MACT Soni Devi etc. Vs. Mahesh Kumar etc. 10 there is ample evidence on file of his owning an Auto Rickshaw. As per the documents on file the deceased would be considered as 39 years old as earlier discussed in the arguments of learned counsel for respondent no.3 as ration card of the deceased shows him 5 years elder to his wife, who when the petition was filed 34 years old. It was the contention of learned counsel for respondent no.3 that they were not liable to pay any amount of compensation since the respondent no.1 did not held any D.L. to drive the vehicle in question and the Insurance Company cannot be held liable in cases of violation of terms and conditions of the policy. This contention of learned counsel for respondent can, however, not be sustained in view of the principles laid down in a similar case by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in 2004(2) RCR 114, National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Swaran Singh & Anr. , where it was held that “in a case of driving without licence and third party claim where there is breach of policy, it is duty of the insurer to satisfy the claim and Insurer will be entitled to recovery back from insured. ” Similar are the circumstances of the present case since it is contention of respondent no.3 that the respondent no.1 had no D.L. to drive the offending vehicle. But even if this contention is believed, still it is duty of the insurer – respondent no.3 to satisfy the claim and it can Jagjit Singh, MACT Soni Devi etc. Vs. Mahesh Kumar etc. 11 recover back the amount from the insured i.e. respondents no.1 and 2. 17)With regard to the amount of compensation to which the claimants are entitled, the deceased died in the year 2003 when he was working as driver and in 2003 even if he has worked as labourer still he could have earned an amount of Rs.3000/- per month and under such circumstances his annual income would come to Rs.36,000/-. Having left behind 3 dependents, 1/3rd of this amount would would be deducted towards the personal living and expenses of the deceased and this amount comes to Rs.12,000/-, leaving the balance amount as Rs.24,000/-. The deceased being 39 years old at the time of his death, multiplier that would apply to him would be that of '15' and by applying this multiplier, the amount comes to Rs.3,60,000/-. Apart from this, the petitioners are entitled to a sum of Rs.25,000/- for performing last rites of the deceased. Alongwith this amount, the petitioner no.2 being widow of deceased would be entitled to separate sum of Rs.50,000/- for loss of consortium and Rs.50,000/- for loss of love and affection. The petitioner no.3 would also be entitled to a separate sum of Rs.50,000/- for loss of love and affection. T he petitioners also become entitled to interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petitions till actual realization. Accordingly, issue no.2 is decided in Jagjit Singh, MACT Soni Devi etc. Vs. Mahesh Kumar etc. 12 favour of the petitioners, while issues no.3, 4 and 5 are decided against the respondents. ISSUE NO. 6(RELIEF):- 24)Keeping in view of my detailed discussion on all the aforesaid issues, the petition is allowed with costs and a total compensation amount of Rs.3,06,900/- is awarded to the petitioners along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization. The respondents No.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation and the respondent no.3 is given right of recovery from respondents No.1 and 2 . Out of the total amount of Rs.3,85,000/-, the LRs of petitioner no.1 would be entitled to a sum of Rs.50,000/- and petitioner no.2 would be entitled to a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- besides Rs.50,000/- on account of loss of consortium and Rs.50,000/- on account of loss of love and affection and petitioner no.3, daughter of the deceased is entitled to a sum of Rs.1,35,000/- besides Rs.50,000/- on account of loss of love and affection. The petitioners are also entitled for the interest of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization. Amount of LRs of petitioner No.1 and petitioner no.2 be given to them by way of cash while the amount of petitioner No.3 be deposited in some Jagjit Singh, MACT Soni Devi etc. Vs. Mahesh Kumar etc. 13 nationalized bank till attaining the age of majority by her. The bank will not advance any loan or create any charge against the FDR without the prior permission of the Tribunal. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly and file be consigned to record room after due compliance. Pronounced in open Court (JAGJIT SINGH) Dated: 29.04.2015 Motor Accident Claims Tribunal Ambala.

It is further averred that, on his statement RAJPAL @ RAMPAL @ RAJA VERSUS SHIV CHARAN & ANOTHER -3- FIR was registered. It is further averred that, as the accident in question had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of Canter bearing registration no. UP-17A-3931 by respondent no.1; hence, respondent no.1 being driver-cum-owner and respondent no.2 being insurer of the offending vehicle in question are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioner. 3.The claim petition has been contested by respondent no.1 by filing written statement. It is averred in the written statement that, the accident, if any, has been caused due to rash and negligent driving of tractor-trolley bearing registration no. HR-54A-9754 being driven by claimant himself. It is further averred that, the answering respondent had also received injuries and as such the claim petition qua the answering respondent is not maintainable. It is further averred that, the vehicle bearing registration no. UP-17A-3931 has been falsely involved in the present case just to extract the compensation. Also controverting other allegations, prayer for dismissal of the claim petition has been made. 4.In its written statement filed by respondent no.2, it is averred that, no accident as alleged had taken place on 20.12.2014. It is further averred that, as driver of Canter bearing registration no.UP-17A-3931 was not having valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident and as the same was being driven in violation of terms and conditions of insurance policy, the answering respondent is not liable to pay RAJPAL @ RAMPAL @ RAJA VERSUS SHIV CHARAN & ANOTHER -4- compensation to the claimant. Also controverting all other allegations, prayer for dismissal of claim petition has been made. 5.From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed for adjudication on 23.11.2015:- 1.Whether the accident in question had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of Canter bearing registration no.UP- 17A-3931 by respondent no.1 causing injuries to Rajpal, the claimant, as alleged?

OPP. 3.Whether the respondent no.2 is not liable to pay any compensation, in view of the breach of terms and conditions of the policy of insurance? OPR-2 4.Relief. 6.In order to substantiate his case, Rajpal @ Rampal @ Raja, the claimant besides examining himself as PW1 has also examined Dr. Vikas Paul as PW2 and thereafter, learned counsel for the claimant after tendering documents closed the evidence vide separate statement dated 14.1.2016. 7.On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent no.1 tendered documents Ex.R1 to Ex.R4 and closed the evidence vide statement dated 3.2.2016. Respondent no.2 has examined Ram Gopal Singh as RW1, Vijay Bahadur as RW2 and thereafter, learned counsel for respondent no.2 tendered copy of insurance policy Ex.R10 and closed the RAJPAL @ RAMPAL @ RAJA VERSUS SHIV CHARAN & ANOTHER -5- evidence vide separate statement. 8.Arguments have been addressed by the learned counsel for the parties and the records have also been perused. My issue-wise findings are as under:- Issue no.1 9.To prove this issue, Rajpal @ Rampal @ Raja, the petitioner has examined himself as PW1. He has deposed by way of affidavit as Ex.PW1/A tendered in his examination in chief reiterating the contents of the petition. During cross examination, he has deposed that, he has no documentary proof regarding his employment as driver with Naresh Kumar s/o Uttam Chand. He has further deposed that, he has no documentary proof with regard to his income of Rs.15,000/- per month. He has further deposed that, he was alone on the tractor-trolley and was driving the same at the speed of 15 km. per hour. He has denied that, this accident had taken place due to his negligence and has implicated Canter no.UP-17A-3931 falsely. Shiv Charan, the respondent no.1 did not step into the witness box to rebut the evidence led by claimant. Learned counsel for the claimant has relied upon Raju & ors. Versus Sukhwinder Singh & ors. 2007(III) ACC page 254, wherein Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that “ driver of truck did not enter witness box to deny allegations of witness regarding his involvement in accident; adverse inference can be drawn against him. Further it is absolutely RAJPAL @ RAMPAL @ RAJA VERSUS SHIV CHARAN & ANOTHER -6- necessary to have the first hand report from the driver. It may be that the driver does not always speak the truth, but the driver's version is the one which is to be given the best consideration. He only knows as to what actually happened. Therefore, the driver having not been examined, necessarily, an ad verse inference arises against him ”. Learned counsel for the claimant has urged that fact of registration of FIR No. 162 dated 24.12.2014 under Sections 279,337 IPC with Police Station, Shahzadpur as Ex.P1, wherein charge was framed against him vide order dated 15.4.2015 as Ex.P5 coupled with report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. Ex.P6 is sufficient to arrive at the conclusion that accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of Canter bearing registration no. UP-17A- 3931 by Shiv Charan, the respondent no.1. Learned counsel for the claimant has also placed reliance upon Gurdeep Kaur Versus Tarsem Singh 2008(2) RCR(Civil) page 775 wherein Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that “ if the driver is being tried on account of rash and negligent driving in a criminal case in a court of law, it is prima facie safe to hold that the accident occurred on account of his rash and negligent act. It is further held that in a claim petition under Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, the evidence should not be scrutinized in the manner as is done in a civil or in a criminal case. The proceedings before the Tribunal are of the nature of summary enquiry, whereas in a criminal case, the rule is of proof beyond reasonable doubt and in a civil case, the rule is of preponderance of probabilities. If there is some evidence before RAJPAL @ RAMPAL @ RAJA VERSUS SHIV CHARAN & ANOTHER -7- the claim Tribunal to prove a fact, no nicety, doubt or suspicion should weigh with it, in deciding a Motor Accident Claim case. It is further held that Tribunals established under the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 are not governed by the rules of procedure envisaged by the Civil Procedure Code and Tribunals are required to evolve their own procedure to meet the ends of justice, based on the principles of justice, equity and good conscience”. It is also held in Bimla Devi Versus Himachal Road Transport Corpn. And others AIR 2009 SC 2819 that “ it is not possible to give strict proof of accident by the claimants and they have to establish their case merely on touchstone of preponderance of probability”. The injuries suffered by Rajpal @ Rampal @ Raja, the peti - tioner stand proved from the medico legal report as Ex.P9 of CHC Shahzadpur and treatment record as Ex.P3 of C.Lall Hospital, Ambala Cantt. 10.In view of the above discussion, it is proved that Rajpal @ Rampal @ Raja, the claimant had suffered injuries in motor vehicular accident that had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of Canter bearing registration no. UP-17A-3931 by respondent no.1. Consequently, this issue is decided in favour of claimant and against the respondents. Issue no.2 RAJPAL @ RAMPAL @ RAJA VERSUS SHIV CHARAN & ANOTHER -8- 11.To ascertain the amount of compensation payable to the Rampal @ Rajpal @ Raja, the claimant, discussion is being made under following heads:- Medical expenses 12.To prove this issue, Rajpal @ Rampal @ Raja, the petitioner has deposed by way of affidavit as Ex.PW1/A tendered in his examination in chief reiterating the contents of the petition. He had remained admitted in C.Lall Hospital, Ambala Cantt,where he was operated upon for fracture of right leg and rod was inserted. He remained admitted in C.Lall Hospital w.e.f. 20.12.2014 to 24.12.2014 as is evident from the treatment summary as Ex.P3. Though the claimant has claimed a sum of Rs.2,50,000/- on account of expenditure incurred on his treatment etc., but in the absence of cogent evidence, it appears to be on the higher side. He has placed on record the bills as Ex.P10 to Ex.P24 evidencing expenditure incurred on his treatment to the tune of Rs.37,717/-. Some bills might have not been taken in haste in a bid to provide quick medical treatment or the same might have been lost in managing the patient more than in caring for the details such as collection and retention of the bills. Taking into account, such natural and usual lapse as also human failing, the medical expenses are taken to be Rs.38,000/-. This amount is allowed as compensation for medical expenses. Reference can also be made to Smt. Parsanni Versus Shri Sube Singh and another 2011(2) PLR 764(P&H), wherein it is held that “production of the bills relating to the RAJPAL @ RAMPAL @ RAJA VERSUS SHIV CHARAN & ANOTHER -9- purchase of medicines during the period of hospitalization and oral evidence given by the party about purchasing of medicines ought to be taken as sufficient proof of authentication and admissibility of these documents”. It is further held that “a hospital document produced by a party which is duly authenticated must be taken as sufficient proof of the documents themselves and the requirement to produce the doctor for mere production of hospital documents must be immediately given up”. Pain and Sufferings and Disability 13The injured/claimant had remained admitted in C.Lall Hospital, Ambala Cantt. from 20.12.2014 to 24.12.2104 as is evident from document as Ex.P3. He had suffered fracture right leg besides multiple injuries. Dr. Vikas Pal, PW2, Medical Officer, Civil Hospital, Ambala City has deposed that, after examination of Rajpal @ Rampal @ Raja by the Medical Board, he was found to have suffered 15% permanent disability on account of right hip joint. He has proved the disability certificate as Ex.P4. During cross examination, he has deposed that, the disability as shown in Ex.P4 pertains to particular limb only and will not affect the other parts of the body. There is also no cogent evidence on record to substantiate any impact on his earnings on account of injuries suffered in the accident; therefore, to my mind, compensation on account of permanent disability suffered by claimant at the rate of Rs.2000/- for every 1% disability is justified. Reference can be made to Ram Kiran RAJPAL @ RAMPAL @ RAJA VERSUS SHIV CHARAN & ANOTHER -10- Goyal Versus Sub Divisional Engineer, Mechanical and others 2008(2) RCR page 103. Hence, the claimant is held entitled to a sum of Rs.30,000/- on account of disability. It was a time of travail and trauma. He must have been confined to bed for sufficiently long time and life would not have been the same for him. Hence, a sum of Rs.5,000/- is awarded as compensation to the claimant on account of pain and suffering. Reference can be made to Sri Laxman @ Laxman Mourya Versus Divisional Manager,Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. & Anr. 2012(1) TAC 376(SC), wherein, it has been held that “ efforts should always be made to award adequate compensation, not only for the physical injury and treatment, but also for pain, suffering and trauma caused due to accident”. Nutritious Diet 14. Rajpal @ Rampal @ Raja, the injured had suffered multiple injuries, so nutritious diet was required for early healing of the same. Two months time is taken to be sufficient to come in routine for the injured. Taking charges for nutritious diet to be Rs.2000/- per month, a sum of Rs.4,000/- is awarded as compensation to the injured claimant under this head. Attendant Charges 15.The claimant remained admitted in C.Lal Hospital, Ambala Cantt. from 20.12.2014 to 24.12.2014 . He had suffered multiple injuries. RAJPAL @ RAMPAL @ RAJA VERSUS SHIV CHARAN & ANOTHER -11- At least two months time was required to the injured to come in routine. Even if, he was helped by his family members, such support has commercial value. Taking attendant charges to be Rs.2000/- per month, a sum of Rs.4,000/- is allowed as compensation to the claimant under this head. Transportation Charges 16.The claimant is resident of Village Sirasgarh, Tehsil Barara, District Ambala. After the accident he remained admitted in C.Lall Hospital, Ambala from 20.12.2014 to 24.12.2014 and also must have got follow up treatment from the said hospital. The learned counsel for the petitioner has brought on record receipts Marked-A to Marked-G, evidencing expenditure to the tune of Rs.9,100/- incurred during transportation for follow up check up; however, none from the Ambala Taxi Association has been examined to prove the same. Thus, by approximation, a sum of Rs.5,000/- is allowed under this head. 17.Compensation allowed to the claimant Rajpal @ Rampal @ Raja, put in a tabular form is given as below:- Sr. No.Nature Amount in Rupees 1.Medical Expenses 38,000-00 2.Pain and sufferings and Disability 35,000-00 3.Nutritious diet 04,000-00 4.Attendant Charges 04,000-00 RAJPAL @ RAMPAL @ RAJA VERSUS SHIV CHARAN & ANOTHER -12- 5.Transportation Charges 05,000-00 ____________________________________________________ Total 86,000-00 Hence, issue no.2 is decided accordingly. Issue no. 3. 18.Onus to prove this issue was on the insurance company, the respondent no.2. Shri Ram Gopal Singh, Senior Assistant, Office of RTO, Meerut while appearing in the witness box as RW1 has proved the validity of route permit of truck bearing registration no.UP-17A-3931 vide documents Ex.R6 and Ex.R7. Shri Vijay Bahadur, Junior Clerk, Office of RTO, Baghpat while appearing as RW2 has proved the registration certificate of vehicle bearing registration no. UP-17A-3931 as Ex.R9. The accident in question had taken place on 20.12.2014 and the insurance policy as Ex.R10 is valid from 12.12.2014 to 11.12.2015. The learned counsel for respondent no.2 has also not disputed the validity and genuineness of driving licence as Ex.R3 of Shiv Charan, the respondent no.1; hence, respondent no.2 has failed to discharge its onus. Learned counsel for the claimant has relied upon National Insurance Company Limited Versus Rajrani and others 2009(1) RCR(Civil) page 557. Hence this issue is decided against respondent no.2 and in favour of the claimant. Issue no.4 (Relief) RAJPAL @ RAMPAL @ RAJA VERSUS SHIV CHARAN & ANOTHER -13- 19.In view of the discussion made above, the present claim petition is partly allowed with costs and a sum of Rs.86,0 00 /- in all is awarded as compensation to the claimant which shall be payable in cash. The claimant is also held entitled to interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing the claim petition till realization. As the accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of Canter bearing registration no.

Shri Amanjot Singh Sarao, Counsel for the respondents No.1 & 2. Shri Mohinder Bindal, Counsel for the respondent No.3. AWARD:- This award shall dispose of two claim petitions No.157/MACT of 2014 titled as Bhupinder Singh Vs Dharmendra Prajapati etc (hereinafter referred to as “First Petition”) and claim petition No. 03/MACT of 2015 titled as Bhupinder Singh etc Vs Dharmendra Prajapati etc (hereinafter referred to as “Second Petition”) arising out of one and same accident, out of them, first petition is for grant of compensation of Rs. 15,00,000/- on account of injuries suffered by BHUPINDER SINGH VS DHARMENDER PRAJAPATI ETC 3 claimant Bhupinder Singh @Bhupi ; and second petition is for grant of compensation of Rs.40,00,000/- on account of death of Smt. Paramjit Kaur due to injuries suffered by her, i n motor vehicular accident on 31.05.2014, which was allegedly occured due to rash and negligent driving of Sakoda Car driver 'bearing Registration No. PB-10-CN- 8153, namely Dharmendra Prajapati i.e respondent No.1. At the relevant time, the vehicle in question was owned by the respondent no. 2 and was insured with the respondent no.3. 2The relevant facts leading to the claim petitions are that on 31.05.2014, claimant Bhupinder Singh being rider and his wife Smt. Paramjit Kaur being pillion rider, were going from village Mardanpur, Tehsil Rajpura, District Patiala, towards their Village Boh, Tehsil and District Ambala, on bullet Motorcycle{ red colour} bearing registration No. CH-03-6709, on the correct left side of the road at a moderate speed . The said motorcycle was being followed by Jagjit Singh on his separate motorcycle bearing registration No. HR-01-NF-0913. When they reached at about 12.30 PM, within the revenue estate of Village Dahriyan on Amritsar to Delhi National Highway No.1, in the mean time, a Skoda Car of sky gray colour bearing registration No. PB-10-CN-8153, came from behind, being driven by its driven so rashly and negligent and in a zig-zag manner and firstly overtook motorcycle of Jagjit Singh and then brought his car on his extreme left side of the road near berm and hit front portion of car against the rear portion of his motorcycle. As a result of that, both occupants of motorcycle fell down on the road along with motorcycle. BHUPINDER SINGH VS DHARMENDER PRAJAPATI ETC 4 They received multiple simple and grievous injuries. The offending car stopped at a distance of about 40 yards from the spot. Driver of offending car alighted from the car and came to injured persons. On asking, offending car driver disclosed his name and address as Dharmendra Prajapati. Many public persons were gathered after the accident. However, while taking benefit of the gathering, respondent No.1 slipped away from the spot on leaving his car there. Someone from the gathering gave telephonic message to Ambulance No.108 and it reached the spot. They were taken to AP Jain Civil Hospital Rajpura from the spot, accompanied by Jagjit Singh. After first aid, they were referred to Rajindra Hospital, Patiala but on seeing their serious condition, they were taken to GMCH Sector-32 Chandigarh, but on reaching near the gate of said Hospital, Smt. Paramjit Kaur succumbed to injuries and her dead body was brought back to Rajpura. Claimant Bhupinder Singh had suffered multiple simple and grievous injuries on left hand, left wrist, fracture of left hip, fracture of two bones left ankle joint, bone deep crushed injury, removing skin muscles and heel pad. He was admitted at GHCH Sector-32, Chandigarh on 3.6.2014 and was discharged from the said hospital on 10.6.2014, after operation etc,. He further attended OPD of said hospital on 17.06.2014, 08.07.2014, 05.08.2014 and 09.09.2014. He has been visiting the said hospital in a car owned by his father and is spending Rs.1000/- per visit on fuel besides Rs.400/- per day as charges of hired driver and charges of other expenses and as such he spent more than Rs.1,75,000/- on his treatment, diet, transportation, visitors and BHUPINDER SINGH VS DHARMENDER PRAJAPATI ETC 5 attendants etc. FIR No. 78 dated 31.05.2014 under section 279, 337 and 304-A of IPC was registered in Police Station Shambhoo, District Patiala against the respondent No.1 and challan against him was filed before the Court of JMIC Rajpura. It is further pleaded that claimant is employed as a helper at CSD Canteen No.2 Kharga, Ambala Cantt at a salary of Rs.7,000/- per month and he remained on leave for a period of two months with pay. At the time of retirement, the leave of two months were to be encashed to him but he suffered a loss of two month salary due to injuries suffered by him in this accident. The accident took place on account of rash and negligent driving of Car bearing registration No. PB-10-CN-8153 by respondent No.1 which is owned by respondent No.2 and is insured with respondent No.3 and so all respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the claim amount. 3Since LRs of deceased Smt. Paramjeet Kaur has instituted separate claim petition on similar facts except income and age etc. She was 32 years of age at the time of death. She got learning work of stitching before her marriage. She was running a boutique in her own premises at Village Boh and was earning about Rs.15,000/- per month. She was also doing entire household work and was rendering services to the claimants to the tune of Rs.10,000/- per month. All claimants were solely dependent on the services and income of the deceased. Father of Bhupinder Singh was totally dependent on household services rendered by Smt. Paramjit Kaur as mother-in-law of Paramjit Kaur had already BHUPINDER SINGH VS DHARMENDER PRAJAPATI ETC 6 expired. After death of Parmjit Kaur, there is no female member in the family to look after the children and to run the boutique. Claimant No.1 has suffered a great loss of consortium and company of his wife. All the claimants have suffered a great loss of love, affection, care, proper guidance and protection etc on account of untimely death of Smt. Paramjit Kaur in this road side accident. The claimants have spent Rs.50,000/- on transportation, funeral and last rites of deceased and as such they claimed a sum of Rs.40 lacs along with interest from the respondents. 4Respondents No. 1 to 3 contested both claim petitions. Respondents no.1 and 2 filed written statement interalia on the preliminary objections that the claim petitions are false and frivolous and have been filed only to extract easy money of compensation; that no accident as alleged was ever caused by the respondent No.1, on the alleged date, time and place. Apart from these preliminary objections, on merits, the entire facts taken in the petitions and injuries attributed to claimant Bhupinder Singh and death of Smt. Paramjit Kaur are denied and prayed for dismissal of both the claim petitions. 5The respondent No. 3 filed separate written statement controverting the assertions made in the petitions. The insurance company took some preliminary objections that present claim petition qua answering respondent is ex-facie, misconceived, vexatious, untenable and devoid of any merit, no accident has taken place with alleged Car bearing registration number PB-10-CN-8153, however, it seems that the present claim petitions have been filed in collusion with respondent No.1 and 2 BHUPINDER SINGH VS DHARMENDER PRAJAPATI ETC 7 just to extract compensation from the answering respondent by falsely impleading the said vehicle in the present case; that if the cause of action is proved, even then, the answering respondent is not indemnified the owner of the car qua the alleged accident since the driver of the alleged Car bearing registration number PB-1-CN-8153 was not having a valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident and thus was driving the same in violation of the terms and conditions of insurance policy; that if it is presumed though not admitted that any accident had taken place on the aforesaid date, even then the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation since the claimant suffered the alleged injuries due to his own and sole rash and negligence driving of the motorcycle No. CH03-6709 at fast speed and abruptly taking turn without caring the rules and traffic on the road and skidding of his motorcycle due to uncontrollable speed; that answering respondent takes all the pleas available under sections 147, 149 (2), 157 & 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act. On merit, it is denied that the claimant had suffered the alleged injuries or remained under such treatment as alleged. The age and occupation of the injured are also denied. The claimant is not entitled for any compensation, however, the amount claimed is imaginary and exaggerated one. No alleged accident had taken place on 31.05.2014 by involving Car bearing registration No. PB-10CN-8153, however, in collusion with respondent No.1 and 2, the offending car was introduced falsely and malafidely in the present case. If it is presumed, though not admitted, that any accident had taken place on the aforesaid date, even BHUPINDER SINGH VS DHARMENDER PRAJAPATI ETC 8 then the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation since the injured suffered the alleged injuries due to his own and sole rash and negligent driving motorcycle without caring the rules and traffic on the road and his motorcycle slipped down of its own due to fast speed and also resulted death of Smt. Paramjit Kaur. It is incorrect that claimant remained under alleged treatment or that Rs.1,750,000/- were spent on the treatment of the injured or that he suffered physically or financially due to alleged injuries. It is also denied that Smt. Paramjit Kaur was running any boutique and was earning amount of Rs.15,000/- per month. Since the present claim petitions have been filed on false and frivolous grounds and without any cause of action against the answering respondent and have been filed only to extract compensation from the answering respondent so, the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. Rests of facts are denied and prayed for dismissal of claim petition with special costs. 6Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following consolidated issues were framed vide order dated 20.04.2015:- 1Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1 while driving Skoda Car bearing Registration No. PB-10-CN-8153 resulting into causing injuries to claimant Bhupinder Singh @ Bhupi and death of Smt. Paramjit Kaur, as alleged ? OPP. 2If Issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom, the claimants are entitled to ? OPP. 3Whether petitions are not maintainable in the present form ? OPR BHUPINDER SINGH VS DHARMENDER PRAJAPATI ETC 9 4Whether the claimants have no cause of action to file the present petitions ? OPR 5Whether respondent No.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect ? OPR 6Whether respondent No. 3 is entitled to take all the defences available to it under the M.V .Act ? OPR 7Relief. 7 To establish their claim through this inquiry, petitioners- claimants examined Bhupinder Singh {First claimant} as PW1, who tendered affidavit Ex.PW1/A reiterating the averments of petition. In cross-examination, he answered that he is working in Kharga Canteen as helper. He has not suffered any loss in his salary due to this accident. He has made entire payment in the hospital against receipt. He was also cross-examined on other questions. PW2 Dr. Pawan Kumar stated that patient Bhupinder Singh was admitted in the hospital on 03.06.2014 as a case of road side accident. The patient was suffering fracture of Bimolecular on right side ankle and fracture on pelvis and was operated for open reduction internal fixation. The patient was discharged on 10.06.2014. He has proved the discharge card as Ex.P1 and medical bills Ex.P2 to Ex.P14. PW3 Dr. Ravi Kumar Preenja stated on the basis of record, whereby he proved the disability certificate as Ex.P15 which was issued on 11.06.2015. The patient was suffering from fracture of ankle and pelvis bone. His disability was assessed at 20 per cent . In cross-examination, he answered that disability given by the board, pertains to left lower BHUPINDER SINGH VS DHARMENDER PRAJAPATI ETC 10 limb only. There will be no impact on day-today activities, however, the patient will face problem in squatting and stair climbing. PW4 Kamaljeet Kaur resident of Village Boh, tendered her affidavit Ex.PW4/A relating to working of deceased Paramjit Kaur. In cross-examination, she answered that she had not shown any entry of any payment in the name of deceased in the account of Panchayat. She has not done any course for assessment of household services of a person. She is under Matri. She does not have any proof regarding making any payment to the deceased. Claimants also tendered copy of FIR as Ex.P16, copy of PMR as Ex.P17, Copy of charge sheet as Ex.P18, copy of report under section 173 Cr.P.C as Ex.P19 and medical bills as Ex.P20 to Ex.P28. On the other hand, respondents did not examine any witness. However, counsel for respondents No.1 and 2 tendered copy of insurance policy as Ex.R1, Copy of RC as Ex.R2, Copy of DL as Ex.R3 and closed their evidence . However, evidence of respondent No.3 was closed by court order. No rebuttal evidence and same was closed. 8I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1 : 9 Under this issue, petitioners- claimants are required to prove the fact that motor vehicular accident was occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Respondent no.1, while driving Skoda Car bearing Registration No. PB-10CN-8153 resulting into causing injuries to BHUPINDER SINGH VS DHARMENDER PRAJAPATI ETC 11 claimant Bhupinder Singh @ Bhupi and death of Smt. Paramjit Kaur and as such the claimants are entitled to appropriate compensation from respondents. 10 Learned counsel for the petitioners-claimants has argued that since accident in question was taken place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1, resulting, injuries to claimant Bhupinder Singh @ Bhupi and death of Smt. Paramjit Kaur, therefore, respondent No.1, being driver, respondent No.2 being owner, and respondent No.3, insurer of offending vehicle are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation as claimed to the petitioners. Learned counsel for claimants has urged that all the respondents are jointly liable to pay the compensation as sought. 11On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent no. 1 and 2 has argued that no such accident, as alleged, was ever taken place with the involvement of offending vehicle, rather, False FIR was lodged against the respondent No.1, therefore, no negligence could be attributed to the respondent No.1 and in this view of the matter, no liability could be fastened upon the respondent no.1 and 2, to pay any compensation because vehicle was insured with respondent no.3 and owner of vehicle did not breach any condition of policy, therefore, insurance company has to indemnify the insured and as such all petitions are liable to be dismissed qua respondent no. 1 and 2 being devoid of merits. He further argued that for the sake of discussion, if accident was taken place, 'though not admitted, even then Respondent no.1 was holding valid license EX.R3 BHUPINDER SINGH VS DHARMENDER PRAJAPATI ETC 12 at the day of alleged accident and offending vehicle was insured with respondent no.3, therefore, respondent no.3 is liable to indemnify the insured and prayed for dismissal the petitions against them. 12 Learned counsel for respondent No.3 has argued that FIR was registered against respondent No.1 only after due manipulation in collusion with respondent no.1 and 2, just to shift undue burden upon the insurance company. He further argued that no accident was taken place with the offending vehicle belonging to respondent No.2, rather, Bhupinder Singh sustained injuries due to own fault while driving his motor vehicle in a rash and negligent manner, at a high speed and without caring traffic rules and so if accident is admitted, even then, respondent no.1 can not be spared from contributory liability . He further argued that respondent no.1 was not holding valid license and so respondent no. 2 has breached the covenent of policy and so insurance company is not liable to pay compensation and prayed for dismissal of both the claim petitions. In support to his contentions, he has placed reliance upon case law titled as Arun Kumar Agrawal and another Vs. National Insurance Company and others, 2010 (3) PLR 428 , wherein it was observed that Second Schedule, Clause 6(a) (b)- Death of house wife/ mother of the family- Compensation- Income of the deceased to be taken as 1/3rd of the spouse. In Jitendra Khimshankar Trivedi and others Vs. Kasam Daud Kumbhar and others, 2015 (2) PLR 359 , it was observed that Deceased- Home maker- Reasonable to fix her income of Rs.3,000/- BHUPINDER SINGH VS DHARMENDER PRAJAPATI ETC 13 per month. 13I have given due regard to the rival contentions put forth by learned counsel for respective parties and have evaluated the entire oral evidence coupled with documentary evidence carefully. After thorough examination, it is observed that the petitioners-claimants have come to this Tribunal with categorical stand that the accident was taken place due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle no. PB-10-CN-8153 by Dharmendra Prajapati, resulting injuries to claimant Bhupinder Singh and death of Smt. Paramjit Kaur . In order to prove factum of accident, PW1 Bhupinder Singh {injured/eye witness} categorically stated through affidavit Ex.PW1/A with regard to factum of accident, which was occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Sakoda Car bearing registration No. PB-10CN-8153 on public road causing injuries to him and death of Smt. Paramjit Kaur . He was cross examined, but nothing adverse can be extracted disbelieving the factual position of motor vehicular accident and so statement of PW1 being injured, can not be doubted from any angle relating to involvement of offending vehicle in the motor vehicular accident, particularly, when his statement is corroborated with documentary evidence like registration of FIR, charge sheet EX.P18 and medical reports etc. It would be appropriate to point out here that despite availing opportunities, respondents failed to rebut the testimonies of claimants with regard to involvement of offending vehicle falsely in the said accident. Mere denial of rash and negligence act at the behest of respondent no.1&2, after causing accident resulting BHUPINDER SINGH VS DHARMENDER PRAJAPATI ETC 14 injuries/death of occupants, are not found sufficient at all disbelieving the factual position of accident. 14It is quite well settled that the lodging of the first information report is not an essential prerequisite for claiming compensation arising from a motor accident. Each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The Tribunal is expected to adjudge a case on the basis of the evidence produced without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled position of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. It must be remembered that in a motor accident claim, the claimants are not required to prove their case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. It is trite law that claimants-petitioners are required to prove its case, which sets up the particular case relating to the accident which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts upon the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way as alleged by the claimants. The provisions with regard to claim under the Act are enacted keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimants are always entitled for compensation irrespective whether the police has registered the offence regarding the incident or not because no claim case can be left over on the mercy of the police. The evidence brought on record irrefutably leads to the inference in terms of unrebutted evidence at the instance of petitioners that there was taken place accident between motor BHUPINDER SINGH VS DHARMENDER PRAJAPATI ETC 15 cycle and Skoda Car resulting injuries to claimant Bhupinder Singh and death of Smt. Paramjit Kaur. Thus, it can be safely held that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of driver of offending vehicle. Accordingly, this issue no.1 is decided in favour of the claimants. ISSUE NO. 2: 15The onus to prove this issue is upon claimants. Learned counsel for claimants has submitted that respondent no.2 is registered owner of offending vehicle which is insured with respondent no.3. He urged that all respondents are jointly and severally to pay compensation. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents No. 3 has vehemently argued claimant Bhupinder was at fault while driving his vehicle and so he is contributory liable to pay amount of compensation and prayed for dismissal both petition with costs. 16Pondering over question of liabilities, it is observed that PW1 sustained injuries in the motor vehicular accident. So far as claim of injured Bhupinder Singh is concerned; PW2 Dr. Pawan Kumar, categorical stated that patient Bhupinder Singh remained admitted in the hospital on 03.06.2014 and was discharged on 10.06.2014. Further PW3 Dr. Ravi Kumar Preenja has proved disability certificate as Ex.P15 dated 11.06.2015. His disability was assessed at 20 per cent . It has also brought in evidence that disability given by the board, pertains to left lower limb only. 17 In view of extent of physical disability and its nature when BHUPINDER SINGH VS DHARMENDER PRAJAPATI ETC 16 examined in the light of Judgment in Ram Kiran Goyal vs Sub Divisional engineer, mechanical and other 2008 {2} RCR {Civil}103 , the claimant Bhupinder is held entitled to Rs. 40000/- @ 2,000/- per percent. First claimant has also proved bills EX.P2 to EX.P14 showing total expenses of Rs.10402/- in round figure10400/- during medical treatment. 18In view of the law settled in Raj Kumar Vs Ajay Kumar, (2011)1 SCC 343 , the petitioner is held entitled to the following compensation: Pecuniary damages (Special damages) 40 percent permanent Physical injuries to particular limb; Rs. 40000/- (i).Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization in PGI, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and miscellaneous expenditure.RS.10400/-medical expenses and Rs. 8000/- {Rs.1000/- per day as indoor patient including other expenses}. (ii).Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising: (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment; (b) Loss of future earning on account of injuries etc. nil/- nil (iii). Future medical expenses. 5000/- None-pecuniary damages (General damages) (iv). Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries. RS. 10 ,000/- (v). Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage). nil (vi).Loss of expectation of life ( shortening of normal longevity). Nil. Total Compensation Rs.73400/- BHUPINDER SINGH VS DHARMENDER PRAJAPATI ETC 17 19In this way, first petitioner-claimant is held entitled to comenstaion of Rs.73400/- along with interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till realization of awarded amount. The amount of compensation is quite fair, reasonable and just compensation. Rests of relief sought by first claimant stands declined. 20So far as second claim petition is concerned; i t is undisputed that deceased was married and died leaving behind her husband{also first claimant being injured}, two minor sons. The deceased was enjoying very good health and physique. Although, PW1 stated that all claimants were dependent upon income of deceased, but it is evident that claimant no.1 was/is self dependent as he was getting salary of Rs.7000/- per month and so it can not be said that he was dependent upon his deceased wife. Further, claimants have shown age of deceased as 32 years in the petition, but postmortem report EX.P17 reflects age of deceased as 36 years and so it can be safely said that claimants have wrongly mentioned age of deceased as 32 years just to exaggerate amount of compensation, however, she was died at the age of 36 years. Undoubtedly, all claimants have deprived from love and affection and also suffered mental shock and agony due to her untimely death. PW1 also stated that they have spent Rs.50,000/- on transportation of dead body and funeral/ last rites of her deceased wife. 21 Coming to question of income of deceased; though, claimants- petitioners pleaded that deceased was earning Rs.15,000/- per month by running boutique and was rendering services of house hold work to BHUPINDER SINGH VS DHARMENDER PRAJAPATI ETC 18 the tune of Rs.10000/-per month and as such deceased was earning Rs. 25,000/- per month. However, claimants-petitioners were required to produce relevant documents to establish her income, but they have entirely failed to establish exact income of deceased and so oral statement of PW1 without supporting any documentary proof of her income, is not found sufficient at all. More so, if deceased was working as household worker and was doing work of stitching etc in the village, even then, her monthly income as a daily wager/ skilled labourer cannot assessed less than Rs.5000/- per month as just compensation. It may not be out of place to mention here that the monetary compensation will never be a sufficient succor for victims of accidental cases rather their needs can only be prevented to some extent by providing just compensation and it can not be cured. The best manner in which victims can be compensated for sufferings only to prevent recurrence of any such road incident by wrongdoer. In failure to protect or prevent sufferings of victims due to death of their mother/wife in road accident who rendered services in one way or other for their family and so it also imposes liability upon state to take extra ordinary precaution to reduce such type of road accident by opting preventive measure like deputing prudent traffic police officials who must follow strict traffic rules against violators in order to avoid such road incident which is increasing day by day. Needless to state that untimely death of a female member will certainly take lot of time for rehabilitation by surviving members. BHUPINDER SINGH VS DHARMENDER PRAJAPATI ETC 19 Apart from this, minor sons of deceased would completely deprive from her love and affection and shall fact pain and agony in one way or other throughout life. 22 It would be appropriate to say that though claimant no.1 is not taken into consideration as dependent upon income of his deceased wife, but income to the extent of her services for family can not be taken less than Rs. 5,000/- per month without any cut or deduction. She died on 31.5.2014 leaving behind her two minor sons and, therefore, they both are taken under her dependency. Therefore, by considering the age of deceased 36 years, multiplier of 15 is to be applied i n view of Smt. Sarla Verma and Ors. Vs Delhi Transport Corporation and another AIR 2009 Supreme Court 3104 . By applying multiplier of 15, the exact assessment of compensation would come to {60000x15} Rs. 900,,000/-. Additionally, petitioners being children and husband have deprived from love and affection and also suffered pain, agony due to her untimely death on account proper care, protection etc, therefore, they are entitled to Rs.50,000/- in these head. They have also spent amount on last rites/funeral of deceased and so they are entitled to funeral expenses amounting Rs.25,000/-. The petitioner no.1 being husband is also entitled to Rs.50000/- as consortium and in this manner, total compensation is computed to Rs.10,25,000/-- which shall be payable along with interest @ 7.5/- per annum from the date of filing the petition till its realization to the petitioners. Rests of relief sought by petitioners-claimants stands declined. Accordingly, issue no.2 is decided in favour of claimants-petitioners. BHUPINDER SINGH VS DHARMENDER PRAJAPATI ETC 20 ISSUE NO.3, 4 &6 : 23The onus to prove these issues are upon Respondents but they neither pressed these issue nor led any evidence. However, it has already discussed in detail under Issue No.1 & 2 that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. In this way, it has become obvious on file that this tribunal has left with no other option except to decide these issues against Respondents. Accordingly, both these issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.5 : 24 The onus to prove this issue is upon the respondent No.3, who is under the obligation to prove this fact that the respondent No.1 was not having a valid driving licence at the time of alleged accident and as such respondent no.2 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy/cover note EX.R1 and so respondent No.3 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimants. However, there is nothing on record to show that respondent No.1, was not holding any valid license, rather same is proved as EX.R3. Further, Insurance Policy Ex.R1 reveals that offending vehicle 'as per RC EX.R2, was insured with the respondent No.3 at the relevant time. There is nothing brought on record to show that the Driving licence Ex.R3 was invalid at the day of occurrence. In the fact and circumstances, it is quite clear that the respondent no.2, did not violate or breach any covenant and condition of the insurance policy. Accordingly, this Issue is decided against the respondent No.3. ISSUE NO.7 (RELIEF): BOTH PETITION SUCCEED ; BHUPINDER SINGH VS DHARMENDER PRAJAPATI ETC 21 25 In view of the foregoing discussion, both claim petition stands allowed with costs in a manner that in first petition, claimant is entitled to Rs 73400/- along with interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till realization of awarded amount.

Respondents Claim Petition under Section 166 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 Present:Shri S.S. Walia, counsel for claimant. Shri Shakti Singh, counsel for respondents no.1 and 2. Shri Mohinder Bindal, counsel for respondent no.3. AWARD Petitioner through her mother and natural guardian Sunita has filed the present petition for compensation to the tune of Rs.15,00,000/- SHIV ANI SHUKLA VERSUS HARJINDER SINGH AND OTHERS -2- on account of injuries suffered by her in motor vehicular accident which had taken place on 12.11.2013. 2.The facts in brief as per claim petition are that, on 12.11.2013 at about 10.00 a.m. petitioner was going to her school on her bicycle. It is averred that, Rahul and her mother had also started journey on Activa bearing registration no.HR-01-AC-6695 and were behind Shivani Shukla. It is further averred that when Shivani took turn towards Ambala Cantt., a car came from Shahbad side and hit against the petitioner from behind and driver of the car i.e. respondent no.1 ran away from the spot after hitting Shivani. It is further averred that Shivani was taken to government hospital, Ambala Cantt., from where was referred to PGI, Chandigarh. It is further averred that car in question was bearing registration no.PB-10-EE-9653. It is further averred that petitioner was operated in PGI, Chandigarh and due to the injuries suffered in the aforesaid accident is unable to study and is still under treatment from Railway Hospital, Ambala Cantt., and PGI, Chandigarh. It is further averred that, as the accident in question had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of of car (i20) bearing registration no.PB-10-EE- 9653 by respondent no.1; hence, the respondent no.1 being driver, the respondent no.2 being owner and the respondent no.3, being insurer of the vehicle in question, are liable jointly and severally to pay compensation to the petitioner. SHIV ANI SHUKLA VERSUS HARJINDER SINGH AND OTHERS -3- 3.The petition has been contested by respondents no.1 and 2 by filing joint written statement. It is averred in the written statement that, a false case has been registered against respondent no.1 in police station Parao. It has been admitted that respondent no.2 is owner of the car bearing No.PB-10-EE-9653(Temp) now bearing no.PB-10-EJ-6070. It is further averred that car in question is insured with respondent no.3, but same has been implicated falsely in this case. It is further averred that, no accident as alleged had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of car bearing No.PB-10-EE-9653(Temp) now bearing no.PB-10-EJ-6070 by respondent no.1 as alleged by the claimant. Also controverting the other averments, prayer for dismissal of claim petition has been made. 4.In its written statement filed by respondent no.3, it is averred that, car bearing No.PB-10-EE-9653 was not insured with the answering respondent on the date of alleged accident i.e. 12.11.2013. It is further averred that as the driver of alleged car bearing No.PB-10-EE-9653 was not having a valid and effective driving licence to drive the vehicle in question at the time of alleged accident and as the same was being driven in violation of terms and conditions of insurance policy; therefore, the replying respondent is not liable to pay compensation. It is further averred that, no accident as alleged had taken place with car bearing No.PB-10-EE-9653. Also controverting all other averments, prayer for dismissal of claim petition has been made. SHIV ANI SHUKLA VERSUS HARJINDER SINGH AND OTHERS -4- 5.From pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed for adjudication on 20.08.2015:- 1Whether the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 while driving car bearing No.PB-10-EE-9653 causing injuries to Shivani, the claimant, as alleged? OPP. 2If issue no.1 is proved, then to what amount of compensation the claimant is entitled to and from whom? OPP. 3 Whether the respondent no.3 is not liable to pay any compensation in view of the breach of terms and conditions of the policy of insurance? OPR-3 4Relief. 6.In order to substantiate her case, the petitioner has examined Sunita as PW1, her mother and thereafter learned counsel for petitioner after tendering copy of FIR as Ex.P1, identity card as Ex.P2, CT scan report as Ex.P3, case summary as Ex.P4 and as Ex.P5, discharge cards as Ex.P6 and as Ex.P7, outdoor ticket as marked-A, bed head ticket as marked-B and identity card as marked-C of Shivani closed evidence vide statement dated 03.12.2015. 7.On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent no.3 after tendering insurance policy as Ex.RA closed its evidence vide statement dated 05.01.2016. However, respondent no.1 and 2 did not lead any evidence and same was closed by their counsel vide statement dated 12.01.2016. SHIV ANI SHUKLA VERSUS HARJINDER SINGH AND OTHERS -5- 8.Arguments have been addressed by the learned counsels for the parties and the records have also been perused. My issue-wise findings are as under:- Issue no.1: 9.In order to prove this issue, Sunita, PW1, the mother of minor has deposed by way of affidavit as Ex.PW1/A tendered in her examination-in-chief reiterating the contents of petition. During cross- examination, she has deposed that, offending car had come from Shahbad side. She has further deposed that, offending car had also hit 2/3 other persons who were also crossing the road. She has denied that she was not present at the spot and has been introduced later on to falsely implicate the said car and its driver in the present case. She has denied that there was no fault on the part of car driver. Harjinder Singh, the respondent no.1 did not step into the witness box to rebut the evidence led by claimant. Learned counsel for the claimant has relied upon Raju & ors. Versus Sukhwinder Singh & ors. 2007(III) ACC page 254, wherein Hon' ble Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that “ driver of truck did not enter witness box to deny allegations of witness regarding his involvement in accident; adverse inference can be drawn against him. Further it is absolutely necessary to have the first hand report from the driver. It may be that the driver does not always speak the truth, but the driver's version is the one which is to be given the best consideration. He SHIV ANI SHUKLA VERSUS HARJINDER SINGH AND OTHERS -6- only knows as to what actually happened. Therefore, the driver having not been examined, necessarily, an adverse inference arises against him ”. Learned counsel for the petitioner has urged that, fact of registration of FIR no.350 dated 13.11.2013, under Sections 279/337 IPC with Police Station, Parao, Ambala Cantt., as Ex.P1 is sufficient to arrive at the conclusion that, the accident in question causing injuries to Shivani, the petitioner had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of car bearing No.PB-10-EE-9653 by Harjinder Singh, the respondent no.1. It is also held in Bimla Devi Versus Himachal Road Transport Corpn. And others AIR 2009 SC 2819 that “ it is not possible to give strict proof of accident by the claimants and they have to establish their case merely on touchstone of preponderance of probability”. The injuries suffered by Shivani, the petitioner stand proved from CT scan report as Ex.P3 dated 16.11.2013, case summary as Ex.P4 and as Ex.P5, discharge cards as Ex.P6 and as Ex.P7 of Northern Railway Divisional Hospital, Ambala Cantt., outdoor ticket as marked-A and bed head ticket as marked-B of General Hospital, Ambala Cantt. placed on record. 10In view of the above discussion, it is proved that, Shivani, the petitioner had suffered injuries in the motor vehicular accident that had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of car bearing No.PB-10- EE-9653 by the respondent no.1. Consequently, this issue is decided in favour of petitioner and against the respondents. SHIV ANI SHUKLA VERSUS HARJINDER SINGH AND OTHERS -7- Issue no.2: 11To ascertain the amount of compensation payable to Shivani, the claimant-petitioner, discussion is being made under following heads:- Medical expenses 12To prove this issue, Sunita, PW1 has deposed that after the accident, Shivani was taken to General Hospital, Ambala Cantt., from where was referred to PGI, Chandigarh. She has further deposed that, petitioner was operated upon in PGI, Chandigarh and due to injuries suffered in the aforesaid accident is unable to study. During cross- examination, she has deposed that her husband who was employee of railway department is no more. She has admitted that her husband was entitled to reimbursement for family members and now she is entitled for the same. She has further deposed that, every railway employee has to pay Rs.10,000/- on his retirement and thereafter he and his entire family members becomes entitle to medical reimbursement upto any extent and same was deposited by her husband on retirement; thus, no bills pertaining to purchase of medicines have been placed on record and it has also come on the file that petitioner is entitled for reimbursement on account of expenses incurred on treatment; therefore, no amount of compensation is awarded under the head `medical expenses'. Pain and sufferings and Disability 13After the accident, Shivani, the injured/petitioner was taken SHIV ANI SHUKLA VERSUS HARJINDER SINGH AND OTHERS -8- firstly to General Hospital, Ambala Cantt., and thereafter to PGI, Chandigarh. She remained admitted in PGI, Chandigarh from 12.11.2013 to 14.11.2013 as is evident from treatment summary as Ex.P4. She had also remained admitted in Northern Railway Divisional Hospital, Ambala Cantt., from 14.11.2013 to 11.12.2013 and thereafter from 06.01.2014 to 08.01.2014 as is evident from the discharge cards as Ex.P7 and as Ex.P6 respectively. There is no expert opinion on record regarding any disability suffered by her in the aforesaid accident and the impact of injuries on her studies. Hence by approximation, a sum of Rs.20,000/- is awarded as compensation to the claimant under this head. Reference can be made to Sri Laxman @ Laxman Mourya Versus Divisional Manager, Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. & another 2012(1) TAC 376 (SC), wherein, it has been held that “ efforts should always be made to award adequate compensation, not only for the physical injury and treatment, but also for pain, suffering and trauma caused due to accident”. Nutritious Diet 14Shivani, the injured/petitioner had remained admitted in PGI, Chandigarh from 12.11.2013 to 14.11.2013. She had also remained admitted in Northern Railway Divisional Hospital, Ambala Cantt., from 14.11.2013 to 11.12.2013 and thereafter from 06.01.2014 to 08.01.2014. Nutritious diet was required for early healing of wounds. Three months time is taken to be sufficient to come in routine for the injured. Taking SHIV ANI SHUKLA VERSUS HARJINDER SINGH AND OTHERS -9- charges for nutritious diet to be Rs.2000/- per month, a sum of Rs.6000/- is awarded as compensation to the injured/petitioner under this head. Attendant Charges 15The petitioner had remained admitted in PGI Chandigarh as well as in Northern Railway Divisional Hospital, Ambala Cantt., for a sufficiently long period as already mentioned above. She must have required services of the attendant. At least three months time was required to the injured to come in routine. Even if, she was helped by her family members, such support has commercial value. Taking attendant charges to be Rs.2000/- for a month, a sum of Rs.6,000/- is allowed as compensation to the claimant-petitioner under this head. Transportation Charges 16 Shivani, the petitioner is a resident of railway colony, Ambala Cantt. and had remained admitted in PGI, Chandigarh, as well as in Northern Railway Divisional Hospital, Ambala Cantt., for the period as already mentioned above. She also must have visited the said hospitals for follow up treatment for a number of times. Though, no details of expenses incurred on account of transportation have been produced, by approximation, a sum of Rs.10,000/- is allowed under this head. 17Compensation allowed to the claimant-petitioner Shivani put in a tabular form is given as below:- SHIV ANI SHUKLA VERSUS HARJINDER SINGH AND OTHERS -10- Sr. No.Nature Amount in Rupees 1Pain and sufferings/ disability 20,000-00 2Nutritious diet 06,000-00 3Attendant charges 06,000-00 4Transportation charges 10,000-00 ____________________________________________________ Total Rs. 42,000-00 18It has already been held above, that the accident in question causing injuries to the petitioner had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of car bearing No.PB-10-EE-9653(Temp.) now bearing no.PB-10-EJ-6070 by respondent no.1; said vehicle is owned by Jain Tractor Company, the respondent no.2, as is evident from the copy of registration certificate placed on record and the same is insured with the New India Assurance Company Limited, the respondent no.3, w.e.f. 12.08.2013 to 11.08.2014, as is evident from the insurance policy, as Ex.RA; hence, the petitioner is held entitled to get the above said amount of compensation from the respondent no.1 being driver, the respondent no.2 being owner and the respondent no.3 being insurer of vehicle in question, jointly and severally. Hence, issue no.2 is decided accordingly. Issue no.3. 19Onus to prove this issue was on the insurance company, the respondent no.3; however, respondent no.3 did not lead any evidence to SHIV ANI SHUKLA VERSUS HARJINDER SINGH AND OTHERS -11- show that, the vehicle in question i.e. car bearing No.PB-10-EE- 9653(Temp.) now bearing no.PB-10-EJ-6070 was being driven in violation of terms and conditions of the insurance policy as Ex.RA, valid from 12.08.2013 to 11.08.2014. Further more, copy of driving licence of Harjinder Singh, the respondent no.1 bearing no.PB-1020090107144 issued on 15.06.2009 by licensing authority Ludhiana(Punjab) authorizing to drive MCWG/LMV/LMV-GC/Trans valid till (transport) 28.05.2015; (non-transport) 14.06.2029 has been placed on record; hence, the respondent no.3 has failed to discharge its onus. Learned counsel for the claimant has also relied upon National Insurance Company Limited Versus Rajrani and others 2009(1) RCR(Civil) page 557 . Hence, this issue is decided against the respondent no.3 and in favour of the claimant- petitioner. Issue no.4 (Relief) 20In view of the discussion made above, present claim petition is partly allowed with costs and a sum of Rs.42,000/- in all is awarded as compensation to the claimant-petitioner. The petitioner is also held entitled to interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing the claim petition till realization. The said amount of compensation alongwith interest shall be deposited in the name of petitioner being minor through her guardian in maximum interest bearing fixed deposit scheme in a nationalised bank, till she attains majority.

In MACP No.384 of 2014, claimants are parents, brothers and sister of Mehkar Singh and in the connected Claim Petition i.e. MACP No.109 of 2015 wife and minor daughter of Mehkar Singh are claimants. These cases were consolidated vide order dated 06.07.2015. 2.Firstly, the facts are taken from the case MACT case no.384 of 2014 titled as Sudha Devi & Ors Vs. Karam Chand & Ors. In this claim petition, compensation on account of death of Mehkar Singh son of Shri Ved Pal by the claimants in vehicular accident has been claimed. It is averred that on 19.08.2014 at about 10.00 AM Mehkar Singh (now deceased) while going to Duliana-Duliani Dhanori Chilled Milk Centre from his place of posting, stopped his motor-cycle bearing registration no.UP-20/Z- 7748 on his correct left side of the road and in the meantime respondent no.1 while driving his Vehicle TATA SUDHA DEVI & OTHERS VS KARAM CHAND & OTHERS 5 Ace bearing temporary no.HR-99/SL-3136 at a very high speed and in a rash and negligent manner came from Sadhaura side and dashed against the motor-cycle bearing registration no.UP-20Z-7748 and dragged the motor-cycle and the deceased towards right side and thereafter, the said TATA Ace turned turtle. It is averred that due to this impact, deceased received multiple and grievous injuries on his person and his motor-cycle was also badly damaged. It is further averred that Mehkar Singh died on the spot and this accident was witnessed by Mam Chand and Jaswant Singh, residents of village Dhaneora, PS Mullana, District Ambala. It is averred that registration number of TATA Ace was noted down by Mam Chand and Jaswant Singh and on the statement of Mam Chand, FIR against respondent no.1 for causing the accident resulting in death was registered. It is further averred that dead body of deceased was taken to M.M. Hospital, Mullana and postmortem was conducted on 19.08.2014. It is averred that Mehkar Singh (now deceased) was quite hale and hearty and was serving as Supervisor in Vita Milk Plant, Ambala City. It is further averred that all claimants were dependent upon the deceased for their livelihood and they are entitled to compensation. It is prayed that claim petition may kindly be accepted and SUDHA DEVI & OTHERS VS KARAM CHAND & OTHERS 6 compensation to the tune of Rs.40,00,000/- along with interest @ 12% per annum from the date of accident till its realization alongwith costs of the claim petition be awarded. It is further averred that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving TATA Ace bearing temporary No.HR-99/SL-3136 in a rash and negligent manner and respondent no.1 is also the owner of the offending vehicle. It is further averred that vehicle was insured with respondent no.2 and so both the respondents may kindly be held liable to pay compensation jointly and severally. 3.On notice, respondent no.1 appeared and filed written statement taking preliminary objections qua locus standi and estoppel. On merits, it is averred that no such accident had taken place with his vehicle on alleged date, time and place. It is further averred that amount claimed in the petition is highly excessive. Denying all other averments of the petition, dismissal of the same was prayed for. 4.On notice, Insurance Company i.e. respondent No.2 appeared and filed written statement taking various preliminary objections. It is averred that no such accident as alleged has taken place with TATA Ace bearing SUDHA DEVI & OTHERS VS KARAM CHAND & OTHERS 7 T emporary Registration No.HR99-SL/3136 and that claim petition has been filed in collusion with respondent no.1 just to extract compensation. It is averred that if the cause of accident is proved even then the answering respondent is not liable to indemnify the owner of the truck in question since he was driving without having a valid and effective driving licence, Permit etc. 5.On notice, respondent no.3/proforma respondent appeared and filed written statement supporting the claim of claimants. It is averred that only Sudha Devi petitioner no.1, answering respondent and Akriti daughter of Mehkar Singh deceased are entitled to compensation. It is prayed that claim petition qua claimants no.2 to 5 be dismissed. 6.The connected claim petition MACP No.109 of 2015 titled as Seetu Rani versus Karam Chand has been filed by claimants being wife and daughter of deceased Mehkar Singh. Similar stand has been taken regarding cause of accident and liability to pay compensation. 7.Both the claim petitions were consolidated vide order dated 6.7.2015 and from the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed: 1Whether the accident in question took place by rash and negligent driving of TATA ACE bearing temporary registration No.HR-99/SL- 3136 by respondent no.1 Karam Chand resulting SUDHA DEVI & OTHERS VS KARAM CHAND & OTHERS 8 into death of Mehkar Singh, as alleged? OPP 2If Issue No.1 is proved, whether the claimants in both the claim petitions are entitled to compensation, if so how much and from whom? OPP 3Whether the respondent No.1 was not having a valid and effective driving licence on the date of the accident, if so, its effect? OPR 4Whether the respondent no.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and respondent no.2 is not liable to indemnify respondent no.1? OPR 5Relief 8. In order to prove their case, the claimants/petitioners examined PW1 Seetu Rani, PW2 Sudha Devi, PW3 Mam Chand and PW4 A.K. Gupta. Thereafter, Shri J.P .S. Chauhan, Advocate tendered documents Ex.P3 to Ex.P13 and closed the evidence on behalf of petitioners in MACP No.384 of 2014 and Shri G.S. Antal, Advocate tendered documents Ex.P14 to Ex.P17 and closed the evidence on behalf of claimants in MACP No.109 of 2015. 9.On the other hand, respondents examined RW1 Karam Chand. Ld. counsel for respondent no.1 tendered documents i.e. Driving License Ex.R1, copy of insurance policy Ex.R2, copy of purchased documents Ex.R3 to Ex.R6 and closed evidence on behalf of respondent no.1. No SUDHA DEVI & OTHERS VS KARAM CHAND & OTHERS 9 documentary evidence was led by respondent no.2. 10.No rebuttal evidence was led. 11.I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the material pleadings, evidence and the legal proposition applicable to the present case. My findings on the above issues are as under:- Issue No.1 12.T o prove this issue, learned counsel for the petitioners took me to the testimony of PW3 Mam Chand. PW3 Mam Chand filed his affidavit Ex.PW3/A in his evidence and specifically deposed that on 19.8.2014 around 10.00, he alongwith Jaswant Singh was standing in his field. He further deposed that a person was standing with his motor-cycle on his left side on kutcha portion on Shahbad-Sadhaura Road in front of Petrol Pump, Dhanaura and meanwhile, a TATA Ace loaded with passengers came from behind at a high speed and in a rash and negligent manner and by entangling with the motor-cycle standing on the left side and dragged Mehkar Singh towards right side of the road. He deposed that Mehkar Singh died on the spot. He specifically deposed that he is an eye witness to the occurrence and this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving TATA Ace bearing temporary no.HR99/SL/3136 in a rash and negligent manner. He was SUDHA DEVI & OTHERS VS KARAM CHAND & OTHERS 10 cross-examined at length, but there is nothing on record to disbelieve his version. 13.Immediately after the accident, FIR Ex.P1 was recorded, in which Number of TATA Ace is specifically mentioned. It is also mentioned that occupants therein also suffered injuries. 14.Respondent no.1 appeared as RW1 and deposed that accident in question had occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of deceased himself as the motor- cycle had skidded of its own. He further deposed that no accident had taken place with his vehicle in question and that on the basis of false evidence, police implicated him and his vehicle in false case. During cross-examination, respondent no.1 admitted that he is facing trial with regard to the accident in question. 15.Although respondent no.1 has appeared as RW1, but he failed to contradict the case of claimants and PW3, who have duly proved that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving offending vehicle no.HR99- SL/3136 in a rash and negligent manner. 16.After thorough investigation of the case, final report u/s 173 Cr.PC Ex.P15 was filed against respondent no.1. Respondent was charge sheeted vide charge sheet dated 13.1.2015 Ex.P14 in criminal case titled as State SUDHA DEVI & OTHERS VS KARAM CHAND & OTHERS 11 versus Karam Chand, pertaining to FIR No.173 dated 19.8.2014 Ex.P1. 17.As per settled law, if a person is facing trial in a criminal case with regard to the accident, it can be safely concluded that driver was rash and negligent and caused the accident. Proceedings under the Motor Vehicles Act are not akin to proceedings in a civil suit and strict rules of evidence are not required to be followed in this regard. In the case of National Insurance Company Limited versus Sanjay Kumar and others, 2011 (II) ACC 75 (P&H) , it has been held that when driver of the offending vehicle is facing criminal trial, prima facie it can be presumed that he was responsible for accident. Similar law has been settled in case Girdhari Lal versus Radhey Shyam and others, 1994 (1) ACC 504 . In the case of Parmeshwari versus Amir Chand and others 2011 (2) RCR (Civil) 153 , it has been held that in a road accident claim, the strict principles of proof in a criminal case are not attracted and the claimants were merely to establish their case on the touchstone of preponderance of probability. 18.In view of above discussion, this Tribunal is of the view that claimants have successfully proved that accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving his TATA Ace bearing temporary registration no.HR99-SL/3136 SUDHA DEVI & OTHERS VS KARAM CHAND & OTHERS 12 in a rash and negligent manner and Mehkar Singh due to injuries suffered by him in this accident. Accordingly, Issue no.1 is decided in favour of claimants. ISSUE No.2 to 4 : 19.In both claim petitions, compensation has been claimed on account of death of Mehkar Singh. Seetu Rani appeared as PW1 and mother of deceased appeared as PW2. It is case of petitioners that deceased Mehkar Singh was earning more than Rs.15,000/- as he was an employee of Vita Milk Plant. In order to prove income of the deceased, A.K. Gupta from Vita Milk Plant has been examined as PW4. He specifically deposed that he was not an employee of the Vita Milk Plant and he was working through Contractor. So he was not a Govt. employee. PW4 proved salary of deceased for the month of July, 2014 Ex.P2. It is clear from Ex.P2 that Mehkar Singh was received Rs.14,209/- as salary for the month of July, 2014. Accordingly, Rs.14,209/- is assessed as income of deceased at the time of his death. After deducting 1/3rd under the head of personal expenses, loss of family comes to Rs.9472/- per month and Rs.1,13,672/- per annum. The driving license of deceased Mehkar Singh is on record as Ex.P11, from which it is clear that his age was more than 28 years on the date of his death. In view of settled law, SUDHA DEVI & OTHERS VS KARAM CHAND & OTHERS 13 multiplier of '17' is to be applied and on applying multiplier of '17', total loss of dependency comes to Rs.19,32,424/-. Accordingly, Rs.19,32,424/- is awarded in favour of claimants under the head of loss of dependency. 20.In addition to the amount awarded above, Rs.1,00,000/- is awarded in favour of Seetu Rani under the head of loss of consortium, Rs.50,000/- each is awarded in favour of Sudha Devi (mother) and Ved Pal (father), as they have lost their son and got deprived of love and affection of their son. Rs.25,000/- is awarded under the head of last rites and Rs.50,000/- is awarded in favour of Akriti under the head of loss of love and affection, as she has been deprived of love and affection of her father. 21.In total, compensation to the tune of Rs.22,07,424/- is awarded in this case. It is further held that only Sudha Devi (mother), Ved Pal (father), Seetu Rani (wife) and Akriti (daughter) only are entitled to get compensation. Sudha Devi and Ved Pal shall get Rs.5,00,000/- each out of the awarded amount and Seetu Rani and her daughter Akriti shall get the remaining amount in equal share. 22.Now the question arises, who is liable to pay compensation. It has been argued by Insurance Company/ SUDHA DEVI & OTHERS VS KARAM CHAND & OTHERS 14 respondent no.2 that respondent no.1 was driving the offending vehicle TATA Ace bearing T emporary Registration no.HR99/SL-3136 in violation of the terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy Ex.P13. Respondent no.1 appeared as RW1 and admitted that his vehicle was not registered with the registering authority on the date of accident and was not having any permit to ply on that day. He admitted that the vehicle is goods carrying vehicle and also insured for carrying of goods only. 23.It is clear from the FIR Ex.P1 that various persons were sitting in the TATA Ace at the time of accident and even the occupants of TATA Ace received injuries. This Tribunal is of the view that offending vehicle was not meant for carrying passengers. He was plying the vehicle without permit on the date of accident. Accordingly, respondent no.1 was driving the vehicle in violation of terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy Ex.P13. 24.Admittedly respondent no.1 is permanent resident of village Jagdhauli, PS Chhappar, District Yamuna Nagar. His driving licence is on record as Ex.R1. On perusal of Ex.R1, it is clear that same has been issued by Licensing Authority Nagaland. Even in licence Ex.R1, the address of respondent no.1 is mentioned as village Jagdhauli, District Yamuna Nagar. While appearing as RW1, he failed to SUDHA DEVI & OTHERS VS KARAM CHAND & OTHERS 15 satisfy this Tribunal how and when he had gone to Nagaland and from which Licensing Authority, he got his licence issued. It is clear from statement of RW1 that he does not know even the geographical conditions of Nagaland and the route to Nagaland. Considering the settled law, it is held that the licence Ex.R1 was not validly issued by the alleged licensing authority and so respondent no.1 was not having valid and effective licence on the date of accident. 25.In view of above discussion, it is held that respondent no.1 was driving the offending vehicle in violation of terms and conditions of Insurance Policy Ex.P13 and so Insurance Company is exonerated of the liability to pay the compensation. However, keeping in view the settled law in the case of S. Iyyapan vs. United India Insurance Company and others, 2013 (7) SCC 62 , respondent no.2/Insurance Company shall pay the amount at first instance to claimants, as there was valid Insurance Policy Ex.R13. Respondent no.2 shall have a right to recover the amount from respondent no.1. Issues no.2 and 3 are decided accordingly. Relief: 26.In view of the above discussion and findings on the issues, both claim petitions are partly allowed with SUDHA DEVI & OTHERS VS KARAM CHAND & OTHERS 16 costs and compensation of Rs.22,07,424/- is awarded in favour of four claimants, as discussed in Para No.21. 70% of the amount awarded in favour of Sudha Devi, Ved Pal and Seetu Rani shall be deposited in FDRs in nationalized bank for five years. Entire amount awarded in favour of Akriti shall be deposited in FDR in her name till the date of her attaining majority. The petitioners are also entitled to get interest at the rate of 9% per annum on the total awarded compensation from the date of filing of the present petition till realization of awarded amount. The respondents shall deposit the amount in the Court by way of Cheque/Demand Draft in name of the claimants. Counsel fee is assessed Rs.2200/-. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly. File be consigned to record room after due compliance.

In a case of accident, immediate treatment of the patient is necessary and it is not required that the injured shall be taken to Police Station at first instance for registration of the case. 14.It is clear from record that condition of claimant was very serious and he was taken to Kaushik Nursing Hospital, Matheri Shekhan, District Ambala and considering his serious condition, he was taken to CHC, Chaurmastpur. It is not disputed that rukka was sent on the same day to SHO, PS Naggal regarding the accident. Considering the facts of the case, it is held that delay is not fatal in present case. 15.In view of above discussion, it is held that claimant has successfully proved that accident was caused by respondent no.1 while VIKRAM SINGH VERSUS CHIRA ALIAS NARESH 8 driving Ashoka Leyland (L.G.V.) bearing registration no.HR37D/6175 in a rash and negligent manner and petitioner sustained injuries in the accident. Hence, Issue no.1 is decided in favour of petitioner. ISSUES NO.2 & 3 : 16.In this case, compensation has been claimed by petitioner on account of injuries sustained by him. In his affidavit petitioner has deposed that immediately after the accident, he was taken to CHC, Chaurmastpur, District Ambala, where after conducting his MLR, in view of his critical condition, he was referred to General Hospital, Ambala City, but on the way, he became unconscious, as such, he was got admitted in Kaushik Nursing Hospital, Matheri Shekhan, Tehsil and District Ambala and was thereafter taken to General Hospital, Ambala City on the same day, from where rukka was sent to police, but in view of his critical condition and being unfit to make statement, his statement was recorded by police on 12.3.2015 and thereafter, he was shifted to Kaushik Nursing Hospital, Matheri Shekhan, from where he took treatment up to 10.4.2015 as an outdoor patient and is still undergoing treatment from said Hospital. 17.In order to prove the amount spent by him on his treatment, petitioner placed on record copy of MLR Ex.P5, treatment record Ex.P6 to Ex.P10 and medical bills Ex.P11 and Ex.P12. Considering the MLR Ex.P5 and treatment record Ex.P6 to Ex.P10, medical bills Ex.P11 and Ex.P12 can not be disbelieved. Accordingly, Rs.2888/-, as shown in Ex.P11 and 12, is awarded to claimant under the head of medical expenses. VIKRAM SINGH VERSUS CHIRA ALIAS NARESH 9 18.As per MLR Ex.P5, petitioner suffered four injuries and also complained of pain in other parts of body. Photographs Ex.P13 and Ex.P14 show that petitioner suffered injury on his left ear and left temporal-parietal region. He had not suffered any fracture and his wounds were stitched. Considering the nature of injuries suffered by him, Rs.15,000/- is awarded in lump sum under the head of pain and suffering, special diet and other conventional heads. In total, Rs.17,888/- is awarded as compensation in favour of petitioner. 19.Now the question arises, who is liable to pay compensation. Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 submitted that respondent no.1 was not having a valid and effective driving licence to drive the offending vehicle bearing registration no.HR37D/6175, which is Ashoka Leyland-Light Goods Vehicle. Admittedly, respondent no.1 was having driving licence Ex.R2. RW1 Aman Kumar, DL Clerk in the Office of Licensing Authority-cum-SDM, Ambala prove driving licence Ex.R2 and deposed that verification report Ex.R3 is true and correct as per record of Licensing Authority. He specifically deposed that driving licence of Naresh Kumar is not valid for any class of Commercial/transport vehicle. On perusal of licence Ex.R2, it is clear that licence is for motorcycle with gear, LMV-NT and Car only. Accordingly, it is held that respondent no.1 was not having a valid and effective driving licence to drive Ashoka Leyland bearing registration no.HR37D/6175, which is admittedly a transport vehicle. VIKRAM SINGH VERSUS CHIRA ALIAS NARESH 10 20.While making submissions on Issue no.3, ld. counsel for respondent no.3 further submitted that respondent no.1 was driving the vehicle in violation of terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy and petitioner was a gratuitous passenger at the time of accident, as truck was hired for taking the Waiters including the petitioner to Ghunghat Palace. After considering the evidence on record, this Tribunal does not find any merit in arguments raised by ld. counsel for respondent no.3, as at the time of accident, claimant was not in the vehicle and he was standing on the road. Had it been the case that petitioner was on the truck, being gratuitous passenger and met with an accident, then the Insurance Company would not have been liable to pay compensation. In present case, petitioner was not in the truck at the time of accident, as discussed above, so Insurance Company can not be exonerated on this ground. Accordingly, in view of findings given above regarding licence, Issue no.3 is decided in favour of respondent no.3 and it is held that respondent no.3 is liable to be exonerated of its liability. 21.It is not disputed that vehicle no.HR37D/6175 was insured with respondent no.3 vide Policy Ex.R7 on the date of accident. Although Insurance Company has been exonerated of its liability, however keeping in view the law laid down in the case of S. Iyyapan vs. United India Insurance Company and others, 2013 (7) SCC 62 , respondent no.3/Insurance Company shall pay the amount at first instance to petitioner, being insurer of Vehicle no.HR37D/6175. Respondent no.3 shall have a right to recover the amount from respondents no.1 and 2. VIKRAM SINGH VERSUS CHIRA ALIAS NARESH 11 Issues no.2 and 3 are decided accordingly. Relief: 22.In view of the above discussion and findings on the issues, the claim petition is partly allowed with costs and compensation of Rs.17,888/- is awarded in favour of petitioner. The petitioner is also entitled to get interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum on the total awarded compensation in his favour from the date of filing of present petition till realization of awarded amount. The respondents shall deposit the amount in the Court by way of Cheque/Demand Draft in name of claimant. Counsel fee is assessed Rs.2200/-. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly.

He alleged that accident occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 while driving vehicle in question and VIKRAM SINGH VERSUS CHIRA ALIAS NARESH 7 FIR No.45 dated 14.3.2015 for commission of offences punishable u/Ss.279 and 337 IPC was registered against respondent no.1. He averred that he spent more than Rs.50,000/- on treatment, medicines, transportation, special diet and nursing care etc. He also averred he was quite hale and hearty and was very brilliant and had cleared 10+2 examination privately by setting glorious marks and was studying privately by doing job of Waiter at night hours, thereby earning Rs.12,000/- per month, but after the accident, he is unable to perform any work and is now unemployed and his future prospects have to come an end. 12.Claimant was cross examined at length, but there is nothing on record to disbelieve his version. 13.As per record of the case, accident occurred on 10.3.2015 and FIR was registered on 14.3.2015. In a case of accident, immediate treatment of the patient is necessary and it is not required that the injured shall be taken to Police Station at first instance for registration of the case. 14.It is clear from record that condition of claimant was very serious and he was taken to Kaushik Nursing Hospital, Matheri Shekhan, District Ambala and considering his serious condition, he was taken to CHC, Chaurmastpur. It is not disputed that rukka was sent on the same day to SHO, PS Naggal regarding the accident. Considering the facts of the case, it is held that delay is not fatal in present case. 15.In view of above discussion, it is held that claimant has successfully proved that accident was caused by respondent no.1 while VIKRAM SINGH VERSUS CHIRA ALIAS NARESH 8 driving Ashoka Leyland (L.G.V.) bearing registration no.HR37D/6175 in a rash and negligent manner and petitioner sustained injuries in the accident. Hence, Issue no.1 is decided in favour of petitioner. ISSUES NO.2 & 3 : 16.In this case, compensation has been claimed by petitioner on account of injuries sustained by him. In his affidavit petitioner has deposed that immediately after the accident, he was taken to CHC, Chaurmastpur, District Ambala, where after conducting his MLR, in view of his critical condition, he was referred to General Hospital, Ambala City, but on the way, he became unconscious, as such, he was got admitted in Kaushik Nursing Hospital, Matheri Shekhan, Tehsil and District Ambala and was thereafter taken to General Hospital, Ambala City on the same day, from where rukka was sent to police, but in view of his critical condition and being unfit to make statement, his statement was recorded by police on 12.3.2015 and thereafter, he was shifted to Kaushik Nursing Hospital, Matheri Shekhan, from where he took treatment up to 10.4.2015 as an outdoor patient and is still undergoing treatment from said Hospital. 17.In order to prove the amount spent by him on his treatment, petitioner placed on record copy of MLR Ex.P5, treatment record Ex.P6 to Ex.P10 and medical bills Ex.P11 and Ex.P12. Considering the MLR Ex.P5 and treatment record Ex.P6 to Ex.P10, medical bills Ex.P11 and Ex.P12 can not be disbelieved. Accordingly, Rs.2888/-, as shown in Ex.P11 and 12, is awarded to claimant under the head of medical expenses. VIKRAM SINGH VERSUS CHIRA ALIAS NARESH 9 18.As per MLR Ex.P5, petitioner suffered four injuries and also complained of pain in other parts of body. Photographs Ex.P13 and Ex.P14 show that petitioner suffered injury on his left ear and left temporal-parietal region. He had not suffered any fracture and his wounds were stitched. Considering the nature of injuries suffered by him, Rs.15,000/- is awarded in lump sum under the head of pain and suffering, special diet and other conventional heads. In total, Rs.17,888/- is awarded as compensation in favour of petitioner. 19.Now the question arises, who is liable to pay compensation. Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 submitted that respondent no.1 was not having a valid and effective driving licence to drive the offending vehicle bearing registration no.HR37D/6175, which is Ashoka Leyland-Light Goods Vehicle. Admittedly, respondent no.1 was having driving licence Ex.R2. RW1 Aman Kumar, DL Clerk in the Office of Licensing Authority-cum-SDM, Ambala prove driving licence Ex.R2 and deposed that verification report Ex.R3 is true and correct as per record of Licensing Authority. He specifically deposed that driving licence of Naresh Kumar is not valid for any class of Commercial/transport vehicle. On perusal of licence Ex.R2, it is clear that licence is for motorcycle with gear, LMV-NT and Car only. Accordingly, it is held that respondent no.1 was not having a valid and effective driving licence to drive Ashoka Leyland bearing registration no.HR37D/6175, which is admittedly a transport vehicle. VIKRAM SINGH VERSUS CHIRA ALIAS NARESH 10 20.While making submissions on Issue no.3, ld. counsel for respondent no.3 further submitted that respondent no.1 was driving the vehicle in violation of terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy and petitioner was a gratuitous passenger at the time of accident, as truck was hired for taking the Waiters including the petitioner to Ghunghat Palace. After considering the evidence on record, this Tribunal does not find any merit in arguments raised by ld. counsel for respondent no.3, as at the time of accident, claimant was not in the vehicle and he was standing on the road. Had it been the case that petitioner was on the truck, being gratuitous passenger and met with an accident, then the Insurance Company would not have been liable to pay compensation. In present case, petitioner was not in the truck at the time of accident, as discussed above, so Insurance Company can not be exonerated on this ground. Accordingly, in view of findings given above regarding licence, Issue no.3 is decided in favour of respondent no.3 and it is held that respondent no.3 is liable to be exonerated of its liability. 21.It is not disputed that vehicle no.HR37D/6175 was insured with respondent no.3 vide Policy Ex.R7 on the date of accident. Although Insurance Company has been exonerated of its liability, however keeping in view the law laid down in the case of S. Iyyapan vs. United India Insurance Company and others, 2013 (7) SCC 62 , respondent no.3/Insurance Company shall pay the amount at first instance to petitioner, being insurer of Vehicle no.HR37D/6175. Respondent no.3 shall have a right to recover the amount from respondents no.1 and 2. VIKRAM SINGH VERSUS CHIRA ALIAS NARESH 11 Issues no.2 and 3 are decided accordingly. Relief: 22.In view of the above discussion and findings on the issues, the claim petition is partly allowed with costs and compensation of Rs.17,888/- is awarded in favour of petitioner. The petitioner is also entitled to get interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum on the total awarded compensation in his favour from the date of filing of present petition till realization of awarded amount. The respondents shall deposit the amount in the Court by way of Cheque/Demand Draft in name of claimant. Counsel fee is assessed Rs.2200/-. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly. File be consigned to record room after due compliance.

OPR (3) 4Relief 20.Petitioners, in order to prove their case, examined as many as thirteen witnesses: PW1 Harpreet Kaur PW2 Manju PW3 Aliya Khatun PW4 Pritam Singh PW5 Amit Saini PW6 Aman Sharma PW7 Alka Sharma PW8 Ajay Kumar PW9 Yogesh PW10 Pawan Kumar PW11 Dr. Vikas Paul PW12 Vivek Sharma PW13 Amarjeet In documentary evidence, documents Ex.P37 to 178 were tendered. AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 35 21.On the other hand, respondents examined RW1 Rohit Kumar/respondent no.1. In documentary evidence, documents Ex.R1 to Ex.R11 were tendered. 22.No rebuttal evidence was led. 23.After due consideration of the arguments and evidence of both parties, the findings on the above issues along with reasons for the decision are given below:- ISSUE NO.1: 24.Burden to prove this issue was upon claimants. Ld. counsel for claimants submitted that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving vehicle no.HR37C/8635 in a rash and negligent manner. Ld. counsel relied upon the statements of PW4 to PW6, PW8 to PW10 and PW12 and copy of Challan Ex.P37 and copy of charge-sheet dated 30.07.2015 Ex.P38. and submitted that respondent no.1 was responsible for causing the accident as he was driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. 25.On the other hand, ld. counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 submitted that PW10 Pawan Kumar was driving Bus no.HR68A/2180 in a rash and negligent manner and he could have avoided the accident if he had control over his Bus as he dashed his bus against the Dumper/Tipper, which had turned turtle on the road. Ld. counsel further submitted that last control was in hands of PW10 and had he been driving his bus at moderate speed, the accident could have been avoided. 26.Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 Shri Mohinder Bindal AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 36 Advocate supported the arguments raised by ld. counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 and submitted that even if it is taken that respondent no.1 was not driving Dumper/Tipper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635 at moderate speed and so the Dumper turned turtle in middle of the road, even then the accident could have been avoided by PW10 Pawan Kumar by applying brakes, but he could not control his bus as he was driving in a rash and negligent manner and at high speed and his bus dashed against the Dumper/Tipper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635. Ld. counsel further submitted that all injured witnesses have wrongly deposed that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and these witnesses can not be believed as they have wrongly deposed the facts only in order to support the case of College authorities and to support PW10, so that College be not held liable to pay compensation. Ld. counsel further submitted that PW10 Pawan Kumar appeared as PW16 in criminal case titled as State versus Rohit and admitted that driver of the Tipper/Dumper had not received any injury in the accident and driver side of said Tipper was not damaged, so entire version of claimants and PW10 that it was head-on-collision between Bus and truck, is not believable. Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 further submitted that even if it is taken that respondent no.1 was also responsible for the accident, even then this case is of contributory negligence. 27. Ld. counsel for respondents no.4 to 6 supported the case of claimants and submitted that only respondent no.1 was responsible for the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 37 accident as he was driving vehicle no.HR37C/8653 in a rash and negligent manner. Ld. counsel further submitted that there is no evidence on record, from which it can be held that it is a case of contributory negligence and Pawan Kumar driver was also responsible for causing the accident. 28.I have given anxious consideration to the arguments raised by ld. counsel for the parties and have perused record of the case. 29.In this case, thirteen (13) witnesses have been examined on behalf of petitioners and respondent no.1 Rohit appeared as RW1. Statements of PW1 to PW3, PW7, PW11 and PW13 are not relevant for decision of Issue no.1. 30.This Tribunal is of the view that once drivers of both vehicles have appeared in the witness box i.e. Pawan Kumar/respondent no.4 as PW10 and Rohit Kumar/respondent no.1 as RW1, then statements of other injured witnesses are not so relevant as the drivers would be the best witnesses to make statement about manner, in which accident occurred. Otherwise also, there are vital contradictions om material points in statements of other eye-witness/injured witnesses i.e. PW4 to PW7, PW8, PW9 and PW12. 31.Pawan Kumar/respondent no.4 was driving College Bus bearing registration no.HR68A/2180 on the date of accident and he appeared as PW10. He filed affidavit Ex.PW10/A, wherein he deposed about the accident to the effect that on 31.3.2015, he alongwith students and staff was going from Ambala Cantt. to SDDI Global College and AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 38 SRM Institute of Technology at village Bhurewala, while driving College Bus no.HR68A/2180 at moderate speed on left side of the road and around 7.30/8.00 AM when reached in the area of village Rajpura on Saha Road, offending Dumper/Tipper no.HR37C/8635 being driven by respondent no.1 at very fast speed and in rash and negligent manner, came from opposite side and upon this he lowered down the speed of his Bus and came on extreme left side of the road, but said Dumper came on wrong side of the road and struck against the Bus, resultantly, all passengers in the Bus received multiple and grievous injuries. He further deposed that due to this accident, Aamir Furqan, Vipin wife of Sahil, Parminder Singh, Manish Kumar, Kesar Singh, Ankit Gupta and Deepak Sharma died at the spot. In his cross-examination, he admitted that driver side of Tipper struck against driver side of his Bus and sand/soil entered the Bus from front wind screen as both winds screens of the Bus had broken. So PW10 has admitted in his cross-examination that both wind screens of his Bus had broken and soil/sand came inside the bus. 32.Pawan Kumar (appeared as PW10 in this case), who was driving the Bus in question, appeared as PW16 in criminal case titled as 'State versus Rohit' pertaining to FIR no.41 dated 31.3.2014 registered for commission of offences punishable u/Ss.279, 337, 338, 304 IPC in Police Station Shahzadpur in regard to the accident in question and in his statement dated 16.2.2016 Ex.P41, he deposed that soil of the Tipper entered the Bus when Bus came in contact with the Tipper and stated that AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 39 it was a head-on-collision. He admitted that photographs attached with the file are the same photographs, which were taken after the accident. He further admitted that driver of the Tipper had not received any injury in said accident and driver side of the Tipper had not damaged in the accident. 33.The statement of RW1 is most relevant and he deposed that on 31.3.2015, he was driving Tipper no.HR37C/8635 on correct side of the road at moderate speed and when reached T-point Rajpura, a tractor trolley came on the road and took sudden turn from the T-point, on which he applied sudden brakes, due to which his Tipper turned sideways and when it was lying on the road, the College Bus no.HR68A/2180 came from opposite side rashly and negligently at high speed and dashed against the Tipper from back side, resultantly, the mud lying in the goods wagon of the Tipper entered the Bus from its windscreen and front windows, as a result thereof the mishap took place. 34.It is clear from statement of RW1 that he had not received any injury in said accident. In his cross-examination he deposed that driver of the Bus was driving his Bus in a rash and negligent manner at high speed and could not control his Bus on seeing the over-turned Tipper. He further deposed that said accident could have been avoided by bus driver, if he had controlled the same. It is admitted fact that respondent no.1 had not suffered any injury and it is not the case of claimants or respondent no.4 that any other occupant of the Tipper had suffered injuries in the accident. AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 40 35.PW5 Amit Saini filed his affidavit Ex.PW5/A and in his cross-examination deposed that driver side of the Bus struck against the conductor side of the truck and both drivers suffered injuries. However his statement is totally contradictory to statements of other witnesses and against record. It is matter of record that driver of Tipper had not suffered any injury. It is also very relevant to mention here that while appearing as PW11 in criminal case, PW Amit Saini deposed that there was T-point at the place of accident and Tipper was carrying mud. He further deposed that mud of the Tipper pumped in the Bus, when Bus came in contact with the Tipper and due to entering of mud, there occurred suffocation and many persons died. 36.PW12 Vivek Sharma deposed that accident occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Tipper driver and police had recorded his statement, wherein he had made same statement regarding cause of accident. But while appearing as PW15 in criminal case titled as State versus Rohit, Vivek Sharma deposed that he does not know as to how said accident occurred. He deposed that he had not made any statement to police. He denied the suggestion that said Tipper was being driven in a rash and negligent manner. He further denied the suggestion that said accident occurred due to negligence of accused. Considering above facts, this Tribunal is of the view that PW12 is not a reliable witness as he has changed his stand from one Court to other. 37.PW8 Ajay Kumar (in present case) appeared as PW10 in criminal case and deposed that he had not seen the driver of Tipper at the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 41 spot. He deposed that only left side of the Tipper was damaged. This Tribunal is of the view that he is not a reliable witness and can not be believed on the point of cause of accident, as being employee of the College, his interest is to avoid liability of the College. While appearing as PW8, he deposed that he was sitting on front seat i.e. conductor seat of the Bus. If he is believed, then version of respondent no.1 is also true that Bus dashed against the Tipper when same had already turned turtle on the road and so PW8 Ajay Kumar has rightly deposed before other Court that he had not seen driver of the Tipper at the spot. 38.It is matter of record that most of the other injured persons, who were travelling in the Bus on that day, while appearing as witnesses in the criminal case titled as State versus Rohit Kumar, admitted that there was curve near the place of occurrence and when driver of Tipper applied brakes, the Tipper turned turtle on the road and they deposed that can not identify driver of the Tipper. They admitted that Bus had entered the mud of the Tipper. 39.After considering the statement dated 16.2.2016 Ex.P41 of Pawan Kumar, this Tribunal is of the view that version of PW10 Pawan Kumar is not believable, as had it been a case of head-on-collision, the driver side of the Tipper would have damaged totally as impact of the accident was such that many persons travelling in the Bus died and other occupants of the Bus suffered grievous injuries. The case file of criminal case titled as “State versus Rohit” was also summoned at the time of arguments in this case and photographs of Tipper bearing registration AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 42 no.HR37C/8635 are on that judicial file, from which it is apparent that driver side of the Tipper even did not hit the Bus and so version of claimants specifically PW10 (driver of bus) regarding head-on-collision is totally false. The photographs on record of criminal case file speak otherwise and substantiate the arguments raised by ld. counsel for respondents no.1 to 3. 40.Sudden crossing of the road by a human being or a child; sudden presence of a stray animal on the road; bursting of tyre due to some alien sharp edge article lying on the road; sudden collapse of the bridge; fall of electric wires; tornado; storm; flush of rain water from cloud burst, etc. are a few illustrative circumstances in which driver of a vehicle can possibly lose control. In any such like sudden events, the drive would try to control the vehicle and may apply sudden brakes, which, instead of stopping the vehicle, may over turn it or cause slip thereby the vehicle might go out of the driver's control. Such kind of accident, happening of which is beyond the control of a driver, may be termed as an “act of God”. However, where the vehicle was in sound roadworthy condition and was driven with an ordinary care, it shall always be expected that it will not go out of control of the driver, yet if any such thing happens, heavy onus shall lie upon either the driver or the owner of the vehicle to divulge that special knowledge of the relevant facts to explain as to why and how the vehicle went out of control of the driver. In the absence of any such explanation, the maxim ' res ipsa loquitur' would undoubtedly be attracted, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 43 Court in Krishna Bus Service Ltd. vs. Smt. Mangli and others AIR 1976 SC 700. 41.The site plan prepared by police after the accident is on record as Ex.P40, from which it is clear that there was a curve near the place of accident and so the version of RW1 Rohit Kumar is believable that in order to avoid the accident with tractor, he had applied brakes and the tractor turned turtle. However, considering the fact that he was also driving at very high speed and that had he been driving at moderate speed, he could have controlled the vehicle. The principle of res ipsa loquitur applies to this case and it can be safely concluded that respondent no.4 was also responsible and had contributed in causing the accident. It is a clear cut case of contributory negligence. From photographs on record, it is apparent that the sand/soil entered the Bus up to about six feet from front of the Bus and it speaks about the speed, at which respondent no.1 was driving the Bus. 42.The claimants and their witnesses had tried their best to prove that it was head-on-collision and respondent no.1 was responsible for the accident. However after perusing entire record and statements of witnesses in criminal case titled as 'State versus Rohit', it is clear that there was a curve near the place of accident and somehow on applying brakes, the Tipper turned turtle on the road, which shows that respondent no.1 was driving the Tipper at high speed and had he been driving at moderate speed, he could have controlled his vehicle, but failed to do so. But on the other hand, it is also clear that respondent no.4 Pawan Kumar AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 44 was driving the Bus at such a high speed that mud loaded in the Tipper entered the Bus, as clear from admissions made by the witnesses and photographs clicked after the accident, which are on record of criminal case file. The quantity of sand/soil entered the Bus was so much that the occupants of the Bus felt suffocated and this suffocation was also the result of some deaths. Had respondent no.4 been driving the College Bus at moderate speed and in a careful manner, even if the Tipper had turned turtle in front of the Bus, the accident could have been avoided. So this can be safely concluded that respondent no.4 Pawan Kumar, driver of the Bus, was also responsible in causing of the accident and so accident was the result of negligence on the part of respondent no.1 (Rohit Kumar) and respondent no.4 (Pawan Kumar) and it is a case of contributory negligence. Both drivers were equally responsible for the accident. 43.After considering the entire evidence on record, it is held that claimed have successfully proved that Aman Sharma, Ajay Kumar, Pritam Singh, Yogesh, Pawan, Vivek and Amit Saini had suffered injuries in the accident in dispute and Deepak Sharma, Parminder Singh, Aamir Furqan and Manish Kumar died due to the injuries suffered in the accident in question. 44.After considering entire evidence on record and keeping in view the above discussion, it is held that accident was not the result of rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 only, but respondent no.4 had also contributed in causing of the accident and both drivers were equally responsible in causing the accident on that day. It is a case of AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 45 contributory negligence. Issue no.1 is decided accordingly. ISSUE NO.2: MACP No.208 of 2015 Aman Sharma vs. Rohit & others 45.In this petition, compensation has been claimed by claimant on account of injuries suffered by her. In the petition, claimant has claimed compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the accident. It has been pleaded that claimant suffered multiple, serious and grievous injuries including multiple fractures in right ankle and foot and that after the accident, she was shifted to Civil Hospital Ambala Cantt. She pleaded that she remained under treatment of private doctors and remained admitted as an indoor patient for many days and spent Rs.1,00,000/- on her treatment, transportation and special diet. 46.Claimant Aman Sharma appeared as PW6 and filed her affidavit Ex.PW6/A, wherein she reiterated the contents of petition regarding suffering of injuries, fractures suffered and shifting to Civil Hospital. She deposed that she spent Rs.1,00,000/- on treatment, medicines, instruments, transportation and special diet.

Global College, village Bhurewala, District Ambala and was getting Rs.7,000/- per month. She further deposed that after said accident, she is not in a position to perform her daily routine and has become permanently disabled and is still under treatment. In cross examination, she deposed AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 46 that she has not brought any proof regarding injuries suffered by her, treatment, medical expenses and her income. 47.To substantiate her claim regarding her disability and injuries suffered in the accident, she has placed on record MLR Ex.P43 and Disability Certificate, issued by Medical Board of three doctors of General Hospital, Ambala City, as Ex.P44. From the MLR Ex.P43, it is clear that she suffered one injury i.e. on leg below knee joint. Due to fracture, she was operated upon and due to the injuries suffered, she suffered permanent disability. As per Disability Certificate Ex.P44, petitioner suffered disability to the extent of 5%. In view of the fact that she suffered permanent disability to the extent of 5%, Rs.10,000/- is awarded under the head of permanent disability. 48.Neither prescription slips nor any Bill showing purchase of medicines has been placed on record by the claimant to substantiate her claim regarding amount spent on treatment. Considering the nature of injuries suffered by petitioner and facts of the case, Rs.30,000/- is awarded in lump sum under the head of pain and suffering, special diet, transportation, attendant charges and loss of income. So, in total, Rs.40,000/- is awarded to claimant as compensation in this case. MACP No.209 of 2015 Manju vs. Rohit & others 49.This claim petition has been filed by petitioners claiming compensation on account of death of Deepak Sharma in the accident in question. Manju, mother of Deepak Sharma (now deceased) appeared as AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 47 PW2 and filed her affidavit Ex.PW2/A, wherein she deposed that her son Deepak Sharma was 27 years of age at the time of his death and was hale and hearty. She further deposed that he was employed as Lecturer of Mechanical Engineering in SRM College, village Bhurewala, District Ambala with management of Shree Ram Mulkh Institute of Engineering and Technology, village Bhurewala, District Ambala and was getting salary of Rs.25,000/- per month and was also taking tuition, thereby earning Rs.10,000/- per month. She further deposed that Rs.One lac was spent on transportation and last rites of deceased. She further deposed that the deceased being their only son, they suffered great loss of love and affection on account of his untimely death. 50.PW13 Amarjit appeared with record regarding employment and salary of deceased Deepak Sharma. He deposed that Deepak Sharma was working in Maha Prabhu Ram Mulkh HI-Tech Education Society as Lecturer at salary of Rs.21,600/- per month. He proved Salary Certificate Ex.P7, Appointment letter Ex.P8, Joining letter Ex.P9 and Attendance Register Ex.P10. In cross-examination, he deposed that as per Ex.P9, he joined as Lecturer Mechanical. 51.No evidence has been lead to probe income from any other source viz tuition etc. From the statement of PW13, it is clear that Deepak Sharma was not a regular employee and was only a Guest Lecturer against salary of Rs.21,600/- per month. Accordingly, his income is assessed as Rs.21,600/- per month. In this petition, claimants are parents of deceased. In this petition, claimants are parents of deceased Deepak Sharma. The AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 48 deceased was unmarried son of claimants and so half of monthly income assessed is to be deducted towards personal expenses of deceased. Accordingly, loss of dependency comes to Rs.10,800/- per month and Rs.1,29,600/- per annum. 52.In view of the law laid down in the case of Munna Lal Jain v. Vipin Kumar Sharma, 2015 AIR SCW 3105, age of the deceased is relevant for selection of multiplier, which is to be used while assessing compensation on account where parents are the claimants. On applying multiplier of '17', amount of compensation to be awarded under the head of loss of dependency comes to Rs.22,03,200/-. Rs.1,00,000/- each is awarded in favour of claimants under the head of loss of love and affection and Rs.25,000/- is awarded under the head of last rites. Accordingly, total compensation of Rs.24,28,200/- is awarded in favour of petitioners. The petitioners will get equal share out of the compensation awarded in this case.

He suffered fracture of left tibia and fracture of femur. It is clear from Ex.P113 i.e. Discharge Card of Civil Hospital Ambala Cantt. that after first aid, he was referred to PGI, Chandigarh for further treatment. The medical bills are on record as Ex.P115 to Ex.P137 and this Tribunal is of the view that same are genuine and there is no reason to disbelieve the bills Ex.P115 to Ex.P137.

Accordingly, his salary is assessed as Rs.24,000/- per month. In this petition, claimant no.1 is widow, claimant no.2 is minor son, claimant no.3 is mother and claimant no.4 is father, of the deceased. 60.Considering the fact that there are four claimants, 1/4th of the assessed monthly income is to be deducted towards personal expenses and on deduction of 1/4th, loss of dependency comes to Rs.18,000/- per month and Rs.2,16,000/- per annum. At the time of death, age of deceased was 32 years as per claimants, so multiplier of 16 is to be applied in this case in view of the law laid down in the case of Sarla Verma versus DTC 2009 (6) SCC 121 and on applying of 16, total loss of dependency comes to Rs.34,56,000/-.

Accordingly, his salary is assessed as Rs.19,240/- per month. In this petition, claimant no.1 is mother, claimant no.2 is father and claimant no.3 is brother, of the deceased. In no manner, claimant no.3, who is brother of deceased, can be considered as dependent on his brother Aamir Furqan, when parents are alive. Accordingly, only parents i.e. claimants no.1 and 2 are entitled to get compensation . 85.The deceased was unmarried son of claimants no.1 and 2 and so 50% of the monthly income assessed is to be deducted towards personal expenses of deceased. Accordingly, loss of dependency comes to Rs.9620/- per month and Rs.1,15,440/- per annum. At the time of death, age of deceased was 23 years as per claimants and 24 years as per postmortem report and so multiplier of 18 is to be applied in this case in view of the law laid down in the case of Sarla Verma versus DTC 2009 (6) SCC 121 and on applying of 18, total loss of dependency comes to Rs.20,77,920/-. Rs.1,00,000/- each is awarded in favour of claimants no.1 and 2 under the head of loss of love and affection and Rs.25,000/- is AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 62 awarded under the head of last rites.

Accordingly, loss of dependency comes to Rs.6000/- per month and Rs.72,000/- per annum. At the time of death, age of deceased was 26 years as per claimants and so multiplier of 17 is to be applied in this case in view of the law laid down in the case of Sarla Verma versus DTC 2009 (6) SCC 121 and on applying of 17, total loss of dependency comes to Rs.12,24,000/-. Rs.1,00,000/- each is awarded in favour of claimants no.1 and 2 under the head of loss of love and affection and Rs.25,000/- is awarded under the head of last rites.

Respondents no.1 to 3 will be jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the extent of their share and in the like manner, respondents no.4 to 6 will also be jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the extent of their share. ISSUE NO.3: 90.Burden to prove this issue was upon respondent no.3, but no evidence has been led to prove the same. Accordingly, issue no.3 is decided against respondent no.3. 91.

With these pleadings, these petitioners have claimed compensation of 50 lacs against the respondents, who are the ₹ respective driver-cum-owner and insurer of the offending truck. 6.Respondents no.1 and 2 (driver and owner) in their joint written statements in three petitions raised preliminary objections material being that petitions are not maintainable; that their tanker has been falsely involved; and that claim petitions have been filed just to get compensation. (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 4 of 18 Pages) Dt:01.12.2016 MACP No.367 of 2015 Jasbir Singh & Ors. Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. MACP No.368 of 2015 Saroj Bala Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. MACP No.280 of 2015 Rajesh & Ors. Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. On merits, denying the age, occupation, income etc. of all the three deceased, they pleaded that no accident took place with the offending tanker and a false and frivolous FIR was got registered against respondent no.1 involving the offending tanker by police in connivance with claimants in order to get compensation from them. They further pleaded that at the time of accident, deceased Subhash (driver of the motor-cycle) along with other occupants was coming after having liquor party of new motor-cycle and they were under the influence of liquor. The driver of the motor-cycle was driving it very rashly, negligently and at a high speed and all of sudden, he applied brakes in front of the offending tanker, due to which, all the occupants of the motor-cycle fell on the road. Respondent no.1, who was driving the offending truck at a moderate speed, having a valid and effective driving licence, applied brakes to avoid the impact, but could not prevent the impact due to less distance. As such, there is no fault on the part of respondent no.1. If this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that alleged accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1, then respondent no.3 is liable to pay the compensation as offending tanker is insured with it. Denying other averments of the petitions, dismissal of the same has been prayed for. 7. Respondent no.3 i.e. Insurance Company, in its similar written statements in three petitions, raised preliminary objection of maintainability; petitions being bad for mis-joinder and non-joinder of necessary parties; and that respondent no.1 was not having a valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident and that offending tanker was being driven in violation of terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy. On merits, contents of the claim petitions including nature of injuries, death, profession, income, expenditure on transportation / last rites of deceased persons etc. have been denied and it is pleaded that (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 5 of 18 Pages) Dt:01.12.2016 MACP No.367 of 2015 Jasbir Singh & Ors. Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. MACP No.368 of 2015 Saroj Bala Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. MACP No.280 of 2015 Rajesh & Ors. Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. no accident was caused by the offending tanker and FIR was lodged by the petitioners in collusion with respondents no.1 and 2. It is not liable to pay any compensation since accident occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of driver of the motor-cycle, who was driving it in violation of the traffic rules. The amount of compensation as claimed is stated to be exorbitant. With this stand and controverting other averments of the petitions, prayer is made for dismissal of the same. 8. The two claim petitions titled ''Jasbir Singh Vs. Sat Pal '' and ''Saroj Bala Vs. Sat Pal'' were consolidated vide order dated 23.03.2016. Evidence was directed to be recorded in Ist petition titled ''Jasbir Singh Vs. Sat Pal ''. Following consolidated issues were framed for adjudication:- 1.Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of Maruti car bearing Registration No. PB-13Q-8677 by respondent no.1 Sat Pal resulting into death of Gian Singh and Rajinder Singh, as alleged?OPP. 2.If issue no.1 is proved, whether claimants of the above mentioned petitions are entitled for compensation, if so, to what amount and from whom?OPP. 3.Whether respondent no.1 was not having a valid and effective driving licence on the date of accident, if so, its effect?OPR (3). 4.Whether respondent no.2 has violated the terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy and the respondent no.3 is not liable to indemnify the respondent no.2? OPR (3). 5.Relief. 9. Later on, the third claim petition bearing No. 280 of 2015 titled ''Rajesh & Ors. Vs. Sat Pal & Ors.'' was received by way of transfer and it was also consolidated with the main case. The following issue no.1 (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 6 of 18 Pages) Dt:01.12.2016 MACP No.367 of 2015 Jasbir Singh & Ors. Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. MACP No.368 of 2015 Saroj Bala Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. MACP No.280 of 2015 Rajesh & Ors. Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. was re-framed, which is as under:- 1.Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of tanker bearing registration No. PB-13Q-8677 by respondent no.1 Sat Pal resulting into death of Gian Singh, Rajinder Singh and Subhash Chand, as alleged? 10.Parties have produced evidence to support their respective stand. 11.I have heard arguments of learned counsel for the parties at length and have appraised evidence on record thoroughly and carefully. My findings on various issues are as under:- Issue No.1: 12.In support of this issue, petitioners examined Om Pal as PW2. He is author of the FIR, one of the claimants in one of the case and son of deceased Gian Singh. In his affidavit Ex.PW2/A tendered as examination-in-chief, he deposed about manner of the accident as pleaded in the petition. He also testified that Gian Singh and Rajinder Singh had died at the spot; whereas Subhash Chand died on the way of PGI, Chandigarh and was declared brought dead at PGI. He has been cross-examined at length, but nothing could be elicited so as to disbelieve him regarding manner of the accident. 13.Apart from above, petitioners tendered in evidence documents Ex.P1 to Ex.P13. Ex.P1 is copy of FIR, which was lodged on the statement of PW2 Om Pal son of deceased Gian Singh. It is to be noted that said FIR was registered under Section 304 IPC. Police Investigated the matter and filed challan under Section 304 IPC to prosecute respondent no.1 Sat Pal as an accused. (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 7 of 18 Pages) Dt:01.12.2016 MACP No.367 of 2015 Jasbir Singh & Ors. Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. MACP No.368 of 2015 Saroj Bala Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. MACP No.280 of 2015 Rajesh & Ors. Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. Copy of that challan is Ex.P2. Ex.P3 is site plan of the place of accident. The criminal case after commitment was tried by this court, wherein respondent no.1 Sat Pal faced trial under Section 304 IPC. Copy of charge sheet is Ex.P4. After holding trial, it was concluded by this court that case under Section 304 IPC was not made out and rather, case under Section 304-A IPC was made out. Accordingly, respondent no.1 Sat Pal as an accused was convicted and sentenced vide judgment dated 16.02.2016 for causing death of Subhash Chand son of Kadam Singh, Gian Singh son of Chamela Singh and Rajinder Singh son of Malkhan Singh due to rash and negligent driving of tanker bearing registration No. PB-13Q-8677. The certified copy of that judgment is Ex.P10. Ex.P6 is postmortem report of deceased Gian Singh; whereas Ex.P7 is Death Certificate. Ex.P8 is postmortem report of deceased Rajinder Singh; whereas Ex.P9 is Death Certificate. Ex.P12 is postmortem report of deceased Subhash Chand; whereas Ex.P13 is Death Certificate. 14.The respondents did not produce any evidence in rebuttal on this issue. Even respondent no.1 Sat Pal i.e. driver of offending tanker did not enter the witness box to controvert the statement of PW2 regarding manner of the accident or to prove the stand as taken by him in the written statement. This, in itself, is sufficient to raise adverse inference against respondents that had respondent no.1 entered the witness box, he could not face test of cross-examination. 15.Having regard to the judgment of conviction under Section 304-A IPC Ex.P10 against respondent no.1 Sat Pal and other circumstances as discussed above, there is no reason to disbelieve testimony of PW2 Om Pal. Relying upon the same, it is held that accident occurred on account of rash and negligent driving of tanker No. PB-13Q- (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 8 of 18 Pages) Dt:01.12.2016 MACP No.367 of 2015 Jasbir Singh & Ors. Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. MACP No.368 of 2015 Saroj Bala Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. MACP No.280 of 2015 Rajesh & Ors. Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. 8677, which was being driven by respondent no.1 Sat Pal at the relevant time and which resulted in death of three persons namely Gian Singh, Rajinder Singh and Subhash Chand. Issue no.1 is accordingly decided. ISSUE NO.2: (Claim Petition No.367 of 2015 titled''Jasbir Singh & Ors. Vs. Sat Pal &Ors.'') 16.Claimants of this petition are sons of deceased Gian Singh. All these sons are major being aged 55 years, 52 years and 48 years respectively. One of them namely Om Pal examined as PW2 deposed that deceased Gian Singh was a skilled and hard working person, doing dairy farming and agricultural pursuits and that he used to earn 20,000/-₹ per month. He also deposed that they spent 1ac on the last rites of the ₹ deceased and transportation of the dead body and that they have suffered loss of love and affection of the deceased. 17.Ex.P11 is copy of Jamabandi, as per which, deceased Gian Singh was co-owner to the extent of 4/7th share in the agricultural land measuring 26K 6 Marla in village Badholi. However, he had sold major portion of the said land on 10.12.2012 as per copy of mutation No.3652 placed on file, forming part of Ex.P11. 18.No definite age of deceased Gian Singh has come on file. As per postmortem report Ex.P6, deceased Gian Singh was 70 years of age; whereas in the Death Certificate Ex.P7, his age is mentioned to be 80 years. In the claim petition, petitioners have disclosed age of the deceased to be 78 years. 19.As per Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation 2009 ACJ 1298 (Supreme Court), multiplier to be applied for the persons in the age group of 15 to 20 and 21 to 25 is ''18'' and then it is to be reduced by 1 unit for every five years up to 50 years, which brings (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 9 of 18 Pages) Dt:01.12.2016 MACP No.367 of 2015 Jasbir Singh & Ors. Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. MACP No.368 of 2015 Saroj Bala Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. MACP No.280 of 2015 Rajesh & Ors. Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. multiplier for the persons of age group 46 to 50 years at ''13''. Thereafter, multiplier is to be reduced by two units for every five years, which brings multiplier for the persons in the age group of 66 to 70 years at ''5''. By this analogy, multiplier for the persons falling in the age group of 71 to 75 years should be ''3'' and then for the persons above 75 years as ''1''. However, I am of the view that it will not be appropriate to apply multiplier only ''1'' in the case of deceased Gian Singh, who was 78 years of age as per case of the petitioner. I am of the view that it will be reasonable to apply multiplier ''2''. 20.There is no definite evidence regarding earnings of the deceased, therefore, having regard to his old age, but at the same time, his long experience in life, his monthly earnings is assumed to be 6000/- per month on notional basis i.e. 72,000/- per annum. Having₹ ₹ regard to the old age of the deceased and the fact that deceased did not leave behind his wife, who had already expired and that his sons i.e. petitioners are of major age, it can be assumed that deceased would have spent hardly half of his earnings upon the petitioners and remaining half upon himself. Therefore, dependency works out to be 36,000/- ₹ per annum. 21.By multiplying dependency with the multiplier of ''2'', compensation works out to be 36,000 x 2 = ₹ 72,000/-₹. 22. Besides above, in view of the ratio of Rajesh Singh and others Versus Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (4) Law Herald (Supreme Court) 3006 , an amount of 25,000/-₹ is allowed to the petitioners for funeral expenses. 23.Apart from above, an amount of 28,000/- ₹ is allowed as compensation to petitioners for the loss of love and affection and (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 10 of 18 Pages) Dt:01.12.2016 MACP No.367 of 2015 Jasbir Singh & Ors. Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. MACP No.368 of 2015 Saroj Bala Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. MACP No.280 of 2015 Rajesh & Ors. Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. guidance of their deceased father, which they have been deprived of. 24. This way, total compensation amount payable to the petitioners works out to 1,25,000/-.₹ Claim Petition No.368 of 2015 titled ''Saroj Bala Vs. Sat Pal & Ors'': 25.Sole claimant of this petition is widow of the deceased Rajinder Singh. Said claimant Saroj Bala appeared in the witness box as PW3 and testified that deceased Rajinder Singh was a skilled workman and used to do dairy farming and agricultural work and that he was earning 20,000/- per month. She further deposed that she and other₹ relatives spent 1 lac on the last rites of the deceased and transportation ₹ of the dead body and that she has also been deprived of loss of love and affection of the deceased. During cross-examination, she disclosed that she is a house wife, aged 67 years. Her husband is owner of 10-12 Acres of agricultural land, by which he used to earn approximately 22,000/- ₹ per month. She has no proof regarding ownership of the land or other source of income. She also deposed that he has two sons, who are aged 45 years and 35 years and that both sons are serving in the Army. 26.As per postmortem report Ex.P8, age of the deceased Rajender is 65 years. In the Death Certificate Ex.P9, his age is mentioned to be 66 years. 26.Having regarding to the aforesaid evidence, deceased is taken to be in the age group of 66 to 70 and therefore, appropriate multiplier applicable in this case will be ''5'' as per Sarla Verma's case (cited supra). 27.There is no cogent evidence regarding earnings of the deceased. Having regarding to his mature age, notional income of the deceased Rajinder Singh is taken to be 6000/- per month i.e. 72,000/-₹ ₹ (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 11 of 18 Pages) Dt:01.12.2016 MACP No.367 of 2015 Jasbir Singh & Ors. Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. MACP No.368 of 2015 Saroj Bala Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. MACP No.280 of 2015 Rajesh & Ors. Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. per annum. Only his widow i.e. claimant Saroj Bala was dependent upon him and therefore, half of the earnings is to be taken towards self expenses. After making this deduction, dependency of claimant Saroj Bala works out to be 36,000/- per annum. With the use of multiplier ''5'', ₹ compensation works out to be 36,000 x 5 = 1,80,000/-. ₹ ₹ 28. Besides above, in view of the ratio of Rajesh Singh's case (cited above) , an amount of 25,000/-₹ is allowed to the petitioner for funeral expenses. 29.Apart from above, petitioner Saroj i.e. widow of deceased Rajinder Singh has been deprived of the companionship and consortium of the deceased. Having regard to the mature age of deceased Rajinder Singh, petitioner is allowed 50,000/- ₹ towards loss of consortium . This way, total compensation works out to be 2,55,000/- ₹(1,80,000/- + 25,000/- + 50,000/-). Claim Petition No.280 of 2015 titled ''Rajesh & Ors Vs. Sat Pal & Ors'': 30.The claimants of this petition are widow and three sons of deceased Subhash Chand. Two of the sons are minors. Smt. Rajesh, widow of deceased Subhash Chand entered the witness box as PW1 and testified that her husband was 44 years of age at the time of death and was hale and healthy. The deceased was an agriculturist and also used to do dairy farming and was earning 50,000/- per month. She further₹ deposed that claimants have spent more than 50,000/- on the funeral ₹ rites of the deceased. During cross-examination, she disclosed that deceased was not an income tax payee. She has no proof regarding age of the deceased or about earnings of the deceased. 31.No cogent evidence has been produced regarding earnings of deceased Subhash Chand. Neither any revenue record nor any other (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 12 of 18 Pages) Dt:01.12.2016 MACP No.367 of 2015 Jasbir Singh & Ors. Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. MACP No.368 of 2015 Saroj Bala Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. MACP No.280 of 2015 Rajesh & Ors. Vs. Sat Pal & Ors. document has been placed on file to show that deceased Subhash Chand was an agriculturist or was earning 50,000/- from any source ₹ whatsoever as is claimed by petitioner Smt. Rajesh. In these circumstances, income of the deceased is to be assessed on notional basis. 32.As per postmortem report Ex.P12, age of the deceased was 44 years. There is no evidence to the contrary. Having regard to the said age of the deceased Subhash Chand, appropriate multiplier in this case will be ''14'' in view of the Sarla Verma's case ( cited supra). 33.Having regard to the young age of the deceased, it can be assumed that he must be earning at least 8000/- per month i.e. ₹ 96,000/- per annum. There are four dependents i.e. widow and three₹ sons and therefore, 1/4th amount is to be deducted towards self expenses in view of the law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme court in Sarla Verma's case (cited supra). As such, dependency works out to be 72,000/- per annum.₹ By multiplying the dependency with the multiplier of ''14'', compensation works out to be 72,000 x 14 = ₹ 10,08,000/-.₹ 34. Coming to the funeral expenses of deceased, there is no cogent evidence to prove the actual expenses incurred for this purpose. However, the head “funeral Expenses” does not mean the fee paid in the crematorium or fee paid for the use of space in the cemetery. There are many other expenses in connection with funeral and, if the deceased is follower of any particular religion, there are several religious practices and conventions pursuant to death in a family. All those are quite expensive. Besides this, in legal parlance, 'consortium' is the right of the spouse to the company, care, help, comfort, guidance, society, solace, affection and sexual relations with his or her mate. The loss of companionship, love, care and protection, etc., the spouse is entitled to (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 13 of 18 Pages) Dt:01.12.2016 MACP No.367 of 2015 Jasbir Singh & Ors. Vs.

Reference in this regard may be made to the observations in Rajesh Singh and others Versus Rajbir Singh and others, 2013 (4) Law Herald (Supreme Court) 3006 where amount of at least one lakh for loss of consortium was held to be just ₹ and reasonable and amount of at least 25,000/- was held to be just, fair ₹ and equitable, under the head of “Funeral Expenses”, in the absence of evidence to the contrary for higher expenses. 35. In view of above, an amount of 1 lac₹ is awarded to claimant no.1 Smt. Rajesh widow of deceased Subhash Chand on account of loss of consortium and loss of companionship. Another amount of 50,000/- each₹ is allowed as compensation to claimants no.2 to 4 for the loss of love and affection, which they have been deprived of. 36. Besides above, in view of the ratio of Rajesh Singh's case (cited above) , an amount of 25,000/- is allowed to the petitioners for ₹ funeral expenses. 37.On account of above discussion, total compensation amount payable to the petitioners works out to 12,83,000/-₹ under various heads as per following details:- Sr. No. Head of compensation Amount. 1. Loss of Dependency. ₹ 10,08 ,000-00 2. Loss of consortium and companionship to petitioner no.1 Smt. Rajesh -widow ₹ 1,00,000-00 3.

R6 (also Ex.R4 and Ex.P5) is the Insurance Policy in respect of the offending vehicle, which reveals that said vehicle was insured in the name of respondent no.2 for the period 10.10.2014 to (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page N: 14 of 18 Pages) Dt:01.12.2016 MACP No.367 of 2015 Jasbir Singh & Ors.

The said period covers the date of the accident. As such, it is held that all the three respondents being driver, owner and insurer of the offending vehicle are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation amount, as assessed above. 39.Consequent to above discussion, it is held that in claim petition titled ''Jasbir Singh & Ors. Vs. Sat Pal & Ors.'', claimants are entitled to compensation of 1,25,000/-₹; in claim petition titled ''Saroj Bala Vs. Sat Pal & Ors.'', claimant is entitled to compensation of 2,55,000/-₹ ; and in claim petition titled ''Rajesh & Ors. Vs. Sat Pal & Ors.'', claimants are entitled to compensation of 12,83,000/-;₹ and that said compensation is payable by all the three respondents jointly and severally. Issue no.2 is decided accordingly.

The endorsement for transport vehicle was made on 27.07.2005 and it is valid till 04.08.2015, which covers the date of the accident. There is no evidence on the part of respondent no.3 to show that said driving licence is fake, invalid or ineffective for any reason whatsoever. Therefore, it is held that Insurance Company- respondent no.3 has failed to prove that respondent no.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident. As such, issue no.3 is decided against respondent no.3 -Insurance Company and in favour of respondents no.1 and 2. ISSUE NO.4: 41.Ex.R1 is copy of Registration Certificate. Ex.

Claim petition under Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act. Present: Sh. Depak Lakhanpal, counsel for the claimants. Sh. Ravinder Pal Singh, counsel for respondents No.1 & 2. Sh. R.K. Vig, counsel for respondent no.3. J U D G E M E N T: This award will dispose of four petitions, as mentioned above, as they are arising out of the same accident and common question of law and fact is involved therein. 2)Brief facts of the claim petitions are that on 28.12.2014 the claimant Vinod Kumar alongwith Banarsi Dass, Simran and Amisha were coming from Delhi to Ambala Cantt in car Swift Dezire VDI bearing registration No.HR-99-UK-T-1901 which was being driven by respondent no.1 in a very high speed, rashly and negligently and when they reached at Flyover G.T. Road, Panipat, one big stone was lying on the road near Jagjit Singh, MACT Vinod Kumar etc. Vs. Ashok Kumar etc. 5 the divider and due to that reason the car struck with the stone and thereafter the driver lost his control and the case put over the divider and struck with the vehicle bearing No.PB-10-CU-0369 which was coming from the other side. Due to the impact all the passengers received serious and grievous injuries and Banarsi Dass died due to the injuries received in the accident. Matter was reported to the police and DDR No.7 was got registered. Lastly, it was prayed that an amount of compensation to the tune of Rs.40,00,000/- be awarded on account of death of Banarsi Dass, Rs.20 lacs on account of injuries sustained by Vinod Kumar, Rs.50,00,000/- on account of injuries sustained by Amisha and Rs.10,00,000/- on account of injuries sustained by the claimant Simran along with interest @ 18% per annum, from the date of filing of the petitions till its realization, for which respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation. 3)The respondents no.1 and 2 being driver and owner of the offending vehicle filed joint written statement and denied the averments made in the petition and stated accident took place incidently due to stone and due to this impact the vehicle become unbalance and thereafter struck with another vehicle. The respondents no.1 and 2 are not responsible for the accident. All other material averments were denied. Prayed for Jagjit Singh, MACT Vinod Kumar etc. Vs. Ashok Kumar etc. 6 dismissal of the petition. 4)Respondent No.3 Insurance Company contested the petition by filing separate joint written statement and it was submitted that driver of the offending vehicle/respondent No.1 was not having valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident and insured willfully violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. The factum of accident as alleged by the claimants in the petition was denied. Also, the factum of rash and negligence of the offending vehicle was denied. Remaining contents of the petition were denied and prayer to dismiss the petition was made. 5)Replication was not filed. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed :- 1.Whether the accident in question causing death of Banarsi Dass and causing injuries to claimants Vinod Kumar, Simran and Amisha took place due to rash and negligent driving of Car Swift Dezire VDI bearing registration No.HR-99UK-T-1901 by respondent no.1, as alleged? OPP. 2.If issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation the claimants of all the four petitions are entitled to and from whom? OPP. 3.Whether the insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation, in view of the preliminary objections raised in its written statement and whether there has been a breach of terms and conditions of the policy of insurance? OPR-3 Jagjit Singh, MACT Vinod Kumar etc. Vs. Ashok Kumar etc. 7 4.Relief. 6) In support of their case, claimants have examined Prem Pal as PW-1, Claimant Simran herself appeared as PW-2, claimant Vinod Kumar himself appeared as PW-3 and Arun Kumar Sharma as PW-4. Besides oral evidence, the following documents were placed on record:- Ex.P-1 :Audit Report Ex.P-2 :DDR Ex.P-3 :Proceedings u/s 174 Cr.P.C. Ex.P-4 :Jamabandi Ex.P-5 :Ration Card Ex.P-6 :Disability Certificate Mark-1 to 10 :Medical Bills & Treatment Record Thereafter, ld. Counsel for the petitioners closed the evidence. 7)On the other hand, the respondents have tendered the following documents: Ex.R-1 :Copy of complaint Ex.R-2 :Copy of Insurance Policy Thereafter learned counsels closed the evidence of Jagjit Singh, MACT Vinod Kumar etc. Vs. Ashok Kumar etc. 8 respondents. 8)No evidence in rebuttal was led by the petitioner. 9)I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the material placed on record. My issue-wise finding are given as under:- ISSUE No.1:- 10)The onus of proving this issue was on the petitioners and to prove the same, learned counsel for the petitioners argued that 28.12.2014 the petitioner Simran alongwith her father-in-law Banarsi Dass, her husband Vinod Kumar and daughter Amisha and son were coming back from Delhi to Ambala in their car bearing No.HR-99-UK-T-1901 and the same was being driven by respondent no.1 Ashok Kumar, who was driving it in a rash and negligent manner and did not slow it down despite asking him several times to do so. As a result when they were travelling on the G.T. Road, Panipat Flyover the car struck against a stone lying on the side of the road and as a result the petitioners Simran, Amisha and Vinod Kumar received injuries while Banarsi Dass died due to the said accident. This was got registered with the police vide Ex.P-2 as Unnatural Death Report and has also been reiterated in the witness box by the injured Simran as PW-2, injured Vinod Kumar as PW-3, who was son of deceased Banarsi Dass and no rebuttal to this has come on the part of Jagjit Singh, MACT Vinod Kumar etc. Vs. Ashok Kumar etc. 9 the respondents. Thus, it is clearly proved that the accident in question was caused due to rash and negligent driving of his vehicle by the respondent no.1. 11)Learned counsel for the respondent no.3 meanwhile argued that no such accident was ever caused by any rash or negligent act of the respondent no.1 and this has also been incorporated in Ex.P-2 report lodged by Ashok Kumar, the respondent no.1 himself with the police and which clearly shows that while he was driving the vehicle there was heavy fog and as a result his front side of the vehicle on the driver side struck against a stone and the vehicle imbalanced and went over the divider and resultantly the accident was caused and this happened suddenly and without any fault of any person. It is this report which was at the first stage got lodged with the police and it is pertinent to note that this respondent no.1 Ashok Kumar was also nephew of the deceased Banarsi Dass and cousin brother of petitioner Vinod Kumar. Subsequently no complaint against him has been lodged by any of the petitioners regarding any accident caused by his rash and negligent act and therefore, in the present petition when the rashness or negligence is not proved the petitioners do not become entitled to any amount of compensation. In support reliance was placed upon the principles laid down Jagjit Singh, MACT Vinod Kumar etc. Vs. Ashok Kumar etc. 10 in Minu B. Mehta & Anr. Vs. Balkrishna Ramchandra Nayan & Anr., 1977 ACJ 118, where it was held that “ Whether it is incumbent on the claimants to prove negligence before the owner or insurance company could be held liable for compensation – Held : Yes; because the liability of owner of vehicle to compensate the victim is based on law of Tort. ” It was further held in Pushpa Aggarwal Vs. Krishna Kumar & Ors., 2012(2) PLR 296 , that “It has been clearly mentioned that the accident had happened suddenly and as such no one was at fault. Rightly held that the evidence brought on record is in direct contradiction with the pleadings and as such the claim of the appellant was not maintainable. ” 12)I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the file carefully. 13)In the present case it is the case of the petitioners while they were travelling in their vehicle being driven by respondent no.1 Ashok Kumar they were asking him to drive the vehicle properly but he was driving it rashly and negligently and struck against a stone and caused the accident resulting in the death of Banarsi Dass and injuries to Amisha, Vinod Kumar and Simran. It is pertinent to note that first report lodged after the accident was by the respondent no.1 himself, which is Ex.P-2, wherein he Jagjit Singh, MACT Vinod Kumar etc. Vs. Ashok Kumar etc. 11 has stated that due to fog he could not see the stone lying alongwith divider side and his vehicle struck against the stone and the accident was caused with no fault of any other person. It may be argued that this was lodged by the respondent no.1 to escape from his liability, but it is seen that even on the part of petitioners none after this got any complaint lodged or filed a separate complaint with the police that the respondent no.1 was liable in any manner for any rash or negligent act and subsequently causing the accident. The injured Simran while deposing as PW-2 stated that a DDR was got recorded by Ashok Kumar regarding the accident having happened per chance and she has not got lodged any complaint with any higher official regarding the alleged rash or negligent act of respondent no.1. She stated that there was heavy fog on the date of accident. The injured Vinod Kumar, however, contradicts his wife Simran and stated as PW-3 that there was no fog on the date of accident but even he admits a DDR got lodged by his cousin brother, respondent no.1, wherein it was recorded that the accident happened per chance and none was responsible for it. He admits that he has not given any complaint to any higher official regarding any fault of Ashok Kumar in the causing of the Jagjit Singh, MACT Vinod Kumar etc. Vs. Ashok Kumar etc. 12 accident. This evidence on file clearly goes to show that the petitioners failed miserably in proving any rash or negligent act on the part of respondent no.1 in causing the accident which resulted in the injuries to the petitioners and death of Banarsi Dass. As a result, issue no.1 stands decided against the petitioners. ISSUE No.2:- 14)The onus of proving this issue was on the petitioners but keeping in view of my findings on issue no.1, the petitioners do not become entitled to any compensation in the present case and the issue stands decided against the petitioners. ISSUE NO.3: 14) The onus of proving this issue was on the respondent no.3 but the same was not pressed during final arguments and the same stands decided against the respondent no.3. ISSUE NO. 4(RELIEF):- 15)Keeping in view of my detailed discussion on all the Jagjit Singh, MACT Vinod Kumar etc. Vs. Ashok Kumar etc. 13 aforesaid issues, all the the petitions are hereby dismissed. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly. A copy of this judgment be placed in the connected files. File be consigned to record room after due compliance.

It is further averred that, as the car in question was being driven by Jagmeet Singh (since deceased) who was not having a valid and effecting driving licence at the time of alleged accident and as the same was being driven in violation of terms and conditions of insurance policy; therefore, the replying respondent is not liable to pay compensation. It has also been denied that Maruti Car no.HR-01-AE- 7696 was ever involved in any accident. Also controverting all other averments, prayer for dismissal of claim petition has been made. 5From the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed for adjudication on 15.10.2015:- 1.Whether the accident in question took pace due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 while driving Maruti Swift Car bearing registration no.HR-01-AE-7696 causing death of Jagmeet Singh, as alleged ? OPP GURDEEP KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS RAMESH KUMAR & ANOTHER -5- 2.If issue no. 1 is proved, then to what amount of compensation the claimants are entitled to and from whom? OPP 3.Whether respondent no.2 is not liable to pay any compensation, in view of breach of terms and conditions of the policy of insurance? OPR-2. 4.Relief. However, vide order dated 08.01.2016, issue no.1 was re- framed as under:- “Whether the accident in question took pace due to use of Maruti Swift Car bearing registration no.HR-01-AE-7696 causing death of Jagmeet Singh, as alleged ? OPP” 6In order to substantiate their case, petitioners besides examining Gurdeep Kaur, the petitioner no.1 as PW1, have also examined Sukhwinder Singh as PW2; tendered DDR no.28 dated 05.06.2015 as Ex.P1, postmortem examination report as Ex.P2, ration- card as Ex.P3, voter identity cards as Ex.P4 to as Ex.P6 and thereafter, learned counsel for claimants closed their evidence vide statement dated 08.12.2015. 7On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent no.1 tendered copy of registration certificate as Ex.R5 of vehicle bearing registration no.HR-01-AE-7696 and thereafter closed evidence vide statement dated 16.12.2015. Learned counsel for respondent no.2 tendered writing as Ex.R2 of Ramesh Kumar, the owner of vehicle no.HR-01-AE-7696, copy of registration certificate as Ex.R3, insurance GURDEEP KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS RAMESH KUMAR & ANOTHER -6- policy as Ex.R4 of vehicle no.HR-01-AE-7696, valid from 12.06.2014 to 11.06.2015 and thereafter closed evidence vide statement dated 16.12.2015. Learned counsel for petitioners tendered in rebuttal evidence copy of driving licence as Ex.P7 and copy of MLR as Ex.P8 of Sukhwinder Singh and thereafter closed the same vide statement dated 18.01.2016. 8Arguments have been addressed by the learned counsel for the parties and the records have also been perused. My issue-wise findings are as under:- Issue no.1: 9Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 is based on fault liability of the driver of the offending vehicle, whereas, Section 163-A of the Act does not require the Tribunal to go into such details. In a claim petition under Section 163-A of the Act, the claimants are to show only that the deceased had died in a road side accident which took place while using the motorcycle and negligence of the driver is not to be established. 10To prove this issue, Sukhwinder Singh, PW2 has deposed by way of affidavit as Ex.PW2/A tendered in his examination-in-chief. He has deposed that, on 05.06.2015 he alongwith Jagmeet Singh had gone to Jagadhri, where they met their friends Babloo Saini and Lalit Kumar Dhiman. He has further deposed that, all of them were returning in GURDEEP KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS RAMESH KUMAR & ANOTHER -7- Maruti Swift Car bearing registration no.HR-01-AE-7696 being driven by Jagmeet Singh carefully and by observing traffic rules. He has further deposed that, Babloo Saini was sitting on front seat, whereas he alongwith Lalit Kumar Dhiman were sitting on back seat. He has further deposed that, when they reached near Shri Narain Industries Metal Factory on Shahbad road, suddenly a stray animal came in front of their car and in order to save the animal, Jagmeet Singh applied brakes, but the car went out of control and hit against Safeda tree, as a result thereof, occupants of the car sustained injuries. He has further deposed that Babloo Saini and Lalit Kumar were taken to MM College & Hospital, Mullana, whereas Jagmeet Singh was sent to General Hospital, Jagadhri, but on examining the doctors on duty declared him to be as brought dead. He has further deposed that, this accident had taken place due to sudden appearing of animal and there is no fault of anyone in the said accident. He has further deposed that he had got recorded his statement to the police in this regard. During cross-examination, he has deposed that he had also suffered injuries in the said accident and the same stands corroborated with MLR as Ex.P8 of Sukhwinder Singh on record. He has proved copy of DDR as Ex.P1. Death of Jagmeet Singh stands proved from the postmortem examination report as Ex.P2 placed on file. Thus, from the aforesaid discussion, it stands established that Jagmeet Singh had died in accident in question due to use and involvement of Maruti Swift Car bearing registration no.HR-01-AE-7696. Hence, this issue is GURDEEP KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS RAMESH KUMAR & ANOTHER -8- decided in favour of the claimants and against the respondents. Issue no.2: 11To prove this issue, Gurdeep Kaur, the petitioner no.1 has deposed by way of affidavit as Ex.PW1/A tendered in her examination- in-chief reiterating contents of the petition. Learned counsel for respondent no.2 has contended that car in question was being driven by Jagmeet Singh, who is not registered owner of car bearing registration no.HR-01-AE-7696, which was of Lalit Kumar Dhiman, as has come in the testimony of Sukhwinder Singh, PW2; therefore, as he stepped into the shoes of owner of the car, is not entitled to compensation because owner cannot be both, a claimant and a tortfeasor. In support of arguments, he has relied upon New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Versus Sewa Singh and another 2013 ACJ 1573(P&H), New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Nutan Devi & Others, MAC. App. 274/2007 decided on 22.01.2015 by Hon`ble Delhi High Court, Smt. Asha Rani & Others Vs. Shiv Ram & Another, FAO no.3237 of 2010 decided on 30.11.2011 by Hon`ble Punjab & Haryana High Court, Chandigarh, and Shri Naurang Prasad Vs. HDFC Ergo General Insurance, Suit no.521/14 decided on 31.10.2014 by Delhi District Court . On the other hand, learned counsel for petitioners has relied upon Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Anil Kumar & Ors. I(2015) ACC 740(P&H) decided on 20.08.2013 and Sushila & GURDEEP KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS RAMESH KUMAR & ANOTHER -9- Others Versus Pankaj Mahajan & Another III(2014) ACC 663 (P&H), claiming atleast compensation to the tune of Rs.Two Lac in view of personal accident accident cover vide insurance policy as Ex.R4. 13After hearing learned counsels for the parties, it can be ascertained that Ramesh Kumar son of Mohinder Pal is owner of vehicle bearing registration no.HR-01-AE-7696 as per certificate of registration as Ex.R3 and the insurance policy as Ex.R4 is still in the name of Balvinder Singh. In the case in hand, the car in question was being driven by Jagmeet Singh (since deceased) owned by his friend and accident had not taken place due to involvement of any other vehicle, but because a stray animal had come in front of the car and in order to save the animal, he had lost balance and hit against Safeda tree. It is held by Hon`ble Apex Court in Ningamma & Another Versus United India Insurance Co. Ltd. 2009(3) RCR(Civil) 435 that, “in a petition under Section 163-A of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, the compensation is payable to third party, involved in the accident, as owner cannot be both a claimant as well as a tortfeasor.” It is also held in M/s Reliance General Insurance Company Versus Ranit and another, FAO No.6704 of 2010(O&M), decided on 24.03.2015 by Hon`ble Punjab & Haryana High Court , Chandigarh, that, “on account of personal accident, claim can be given to the person duly covered under the insurance policy and not to anybody else. ” Accordingly, in the case in hand, as Jagmeet Singh (since deceased) was GURDEEP KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS RAMESH KUMAR & ANOTHER -10- not registered owner of vehicle in question; therefore is not covered under the insurance policy; however, in view of law laid down in United India Insurance Co. Ltd. Versus Sidharat Raju and others 2014(3) PLR 736(P&H) and ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd. Versus Puri @ Puri Devi and others 2015(2) PLR 539 (P&H) , petitioners are held entitled to compensation to the tune of Rs.50,000/- for `no fault liability' under Section 140 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of claimants and against respondents. Issue no.3. 14Onus to prove this issue was on the insurance company, respondent no.2; however, respondent no.2 did not lead any evidence to show that vehicle in question i.e. Maruti Swift Car bearing registration no.HR-01-AE-7696 was being driven in violation of terms and conditions of insurance policy, as Ex.R4 valid from 12.06.2014 to 11.06.2015. On the other hand, petitioners have placed on file copy of driving licence as Ex.P7 of Jagmeet Singh (since deceased) bearing no.PB-0820120076952, issued on 27.06.2012 by licensing authority, Jalandhar, authorizing to drive MCWG/LMV , valid till (non-transport) 26.06.2032; hence, respondent no.2 has failed to discharge its onus. Accordingly, this issue is decided against the respondent no.2 and in favour of the petitioners. Issue no.4.(Relief) GURDEEP KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS RAMESH KUMAR & ANOTHER -11- 15In view of discussion made above, the present claim petition is partly allowed with costs and a sum of Rs. 50,000/- in all is awarded as compensation to the claimants in cash in equal shares. As the accident in question had taken place due to use and involvement of Maruti Swift Car bearing registration no.HR-01-AE-7696; hence, Ramesh Kumar, the respondent no.1 being owner and the National Insurance Company Limited, the respondent no.2 being insurer of Maruti Swift Car bearing registration no.HR-01-AE-7696 a re held jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the claimants. In order to facilitate the easy release of the amount to the claimants that too without intervention of the court, as per the directions of Hon' ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in FAO No. 465 of 2010 (O&M), it is ordered that the insurance company will deposit the amount directly in the name of the claimants, either by way of account payee cheque or demand draft in the tribunal, which shall be released to the claimants on proper identification. The claimants will submit the details of their bank account directly to the insurance company under intimation to this court and the cheque shall be released to the claimants on an application for release of cheque/draft alongwith payment order in the name of concerned Manager with directions to disburse the amount as per the details mentioned in payment order and send a compliance report, which should be made part of the main file and to check the strict compliance, a note be also given on the back side of the cheque or draft that the payment be made as per the details mentioned in GURDEEP KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS RAMESH KUMAR & ANOTHER -12- the payment order.

My findings on the above issues are as under: ISSUE NO.1: 10.Burden to prove this issue was upon claimant. Ld. counsel for claimant relied upon the statement of claimant Khajani Devi, who KHAJANI DEVI VERSUS RAJESH KUMAR & OTHERS 6 appeared as PW1 and tendered her affidavit Ex.PW1/A in her evidence, wherein she deposed that 20.04.2015 she was coming from Karnal to her house at Panchkula via Ambala Cantt. by Car bearing registration no.HR14K/7891 being driven by her husband and when they reached near Reebok Showroom, situated at NH-1, G.T. Road, Ambala Cantt, a Canter bearing registration no.HR37C/0961 being driven by respondent no.1 at high speed without observing traffic rules came from behind and while overtaking the car, hit against right portion of the Car, resultantly, both vehicles turned turtle. She further deposed that Car got badly damaged and claimant sustained simple and grievous injuries including fractures and that she alongwith her husband was shifted to Government Hospital, Ambala Cantt., where, after conducting her MLR, she was referred to General Hospital, Sector-6, Panchkula, where she was admitted on 21.4.2015 at 2.15 AM and was discharged on 26.4.2015 and that she also got treatment from ALCHEMIST Hospital, Sector-21, Panchkula.

She further deposed that criminal case was registered against respondent no.1 in Police Station Parao, Ambala Cantt. and that accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving Canter bearing registration no.HR37C/0961 in a rash and negligent manner. She was cross examined at length, but there is nothing on record to disbelieve her version. KHAJANI DEVI VERSUS RAJESH KUMAR & OTHERS 7 11.As per record of the case, accident occurred on 20.4.2015 at 7.30 PM and FIR was registered on 21.4.2015 at 12.35 AM. Although there is delay of only one day in registration of the FIR, but delay is not fatal to the case of petitioner, as it is clear from FIR that information qua accident was received telephonically in Police Station on the same day, but patient was unfit for making statement. In a case of accident, immediate treatment of the patient is necessary and it is not required that the injured shall be taken to Police Station at first instance for registration of the case. It is clear from record that Number of the vehicle is mentioned in the FIR. It is also matter of record that after investigation of the case, final report Ex.P10 was submitted in Court and vide charge sheet dated 17.8.2015 Ex.P13, respondent no.1 Rajesh Kumar was charge sheeted for commission of offences punishable u/Ss.279, 337, 338 IPC. 12.In view of above discussion, it is held that claimant has successfully proved that accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving Canter bearing registration no.HR37C/0961 in a rash and negligent manner, wherein she sustained injuries. Hence, Issue no.1 is decided in favour of petitioner. ISSUE NO.2: 13.In this case, compensation has been claimed by petitioner on account of injuries suffered by her in the accident in question and the amount spent by her on her treatment, attendant charges, pain and suffering, loss of income etc. While appearing as PW1, petitioner in her affidavit Ex.PW1/A deposed that she suffered fracture in left shoulder, KHAJANI DEVI VERSUS RAJESH KUMAR & OTHERS 8 collar bone, right hand wrist and also suffered injuries on left side of her head. She further deposed that she received multiple, simple and grievous injuries on her person in the accident. She further deposed that she suffered loss of vision due to head injury suffered by her in the accident and that immediately after the accident, she was shifted to Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt. in a private vehicle, from where she was referred to General Hospital, Sector-6, Panchkula, where she remained admitted from 21.4.2015 to 26.4.2015. She further deposed that she also got treatment from Alchemist Hospital, Sector 21, Panchkula and is still under treatment. She further deposed that she spent Rs.2,50,000/- on treatment, expenses, special diet, transportation and attendant charges etc. She further deposed that at the time of accident, her age was 54 years and due to injuries suffered in the accident, she remained confined to bed and so suffered loss of income. It is case of claimant that she suffered loss of 32 days' salary, as she will not get leave encashment of 300 days as per her entitlement, due to the fact that her available leaves for encashment are less than 300. 14.In order to prove her hospitalization, petitioner examined Dr. Monika Bali, Medical Officer, General Hospital, Sector-6, Panchkula as PW3, who deposed that patient Khajani Devi wife of Rajbir Singh was admitted in the Hospital on 21.4.2015 at 2.15 AM with history of roadside accident and that she was discharged on 26.4.2015. She further deposed that patient was treated by other Specialist and consultation was done by Orthopaedician, Surgeon, Eye-Surgeon, ENT Surgeon and she was KHAJANI DEVI VERSUS RAJESH KUMAR & OTHERS 9 advised Neurology opinion also. She further deposed that patient had sustained fractures on both bones of right arm and fracture in left collar bone. She deposed that patient was operated upon on 21.4.2015 by Dr. Modi, Ortho-paedician and proved original Discharge Card Ex.P6 and cash receipts Ex.P7 and Ex.P8. She further proved photocopy of operation record Mark-A, photocopy of Nurses Medication Chart Mark-B, TRP BP Chart Mark-C. She further deposed that patient was advised four weeks' rest w.e.f. 26.4.2015 by Orthopaedic OPD Doctor, as per record. 15.From the statement of PW3, it is clear that after the accident, claimant took treatment from General Hospital, Sector-6, Panchkula. Considering the statements of PW1 and PW3, the documents placed on record regarding her treatment and amount spent on her treatment as Ex.P7, Ex.P8, Ex.P17, Ex.P28 to Ex.P48, Mark-A to Mark-D are easily believable, there being no reason to disbelieve the same, since ld. counsel for respondents have not disputed the same. Accordingly, Rs.25,903/- (as shown in Ex.P7, Ex.P8, Ex.P17, Ex.P28 to Ex.P48) is awarded under the head of medical bills and hospitalization charges. 16.It is case of petitioner that she has become permanently disabled due to the injuries suffered in the accident. She placed on record copy of Discharge Certificate dated 30.9.2015 as Ex.P14. Medical Certificate Ex.P14 is the original Certificate issued by Medical Board consisting of three Doctors of General Hospital, Sector-6, Panchkula and there is no reason to disbelieve the same. As per Medical Certificate Ex.P14, claimant suffered permanent disability to the extent of 10%. KHAJANI DEVI VERSUS RAJESH KUMAR & OTHERS 10 Accordingly, Rs.20,000/- (Rs.2000/- per percent disability) is awarded to claimant under the head of permanent disability. 17.The petitioner has also claimed compensation under the head of loss of income. It is case of petitioner that she availed 32 days' earned leaves when she was under treatment, thus she is entitled to get compensation on account of loss of income. 18.PW2 Ram Ratti Devi, Clerk in Government Senior Secondary School, Ramgarh, District Panchkula, brought record of petitioner Khajani Devi. The petitioner is employed as Government Teacher in Government Senior Secondary School, Ramgarh, District Panchkula. PW2 proved Salary Certificate Ex.P1 and Ex.P2 of petitioner. She deposed that petitioner remained on leave from 21.4.2015 to 22.5.2015 and proved leave record Ex.P4. She further deposed that petitioner availed 32 earned leaves during her treatment. She further deposed that a Teacher gets ten earned leaves per year. In view of statement of PW2 and record of this case, an employee is entitled to get leave encashment of 300 earned leaves and it is matter of record that petitioner will retire in 2018 and even if she will get ten earned leaves every year, even then total earned leaves will be less than 300 and so she will suffer a loss of salary of 32 days, as she would have availed encashment of 32 days earned leave. Considering the fact that she availed 32 days' earned leave during her treatment and the fact that Basic Pay, Grade Pay and D.A. for a month as on today, this Tribunal considers it appropriate to award Rs.70,000/- under the head of loss of income due to KHAJANI DEVI VERSUS RAJESH KUMAR & OTHERS 11 availing of earned leave. 19.The petitioner has claimed compensation on account of loss of vision, but no Eye Specialist has been examined in order to corroborate her version. Only an Eye Specialist can depose whether the problem faced by petitioner is a result of injuries sustained in the accident in question. Considering the facts of the case, this Tribunal considers it appropriate to award Rs.25,000/- under the head of pain and suffering, Rs.15,000/- under the head of attendant charges, Rs.5000/- under the head of special diet, Rs.10,000/- under the head of transportation charges. In total, Rs.1,70,903/- is awarded in favour of petitioner. 20.Admittedly, Canter bearing registration no.HR37C/0961 was insured with respondent no.3 on the date of accident vide Policy No.35350131140100001431, effective from 19.6.2014 to 18.6.2015 issued by respondent no.3. Hence, all respondents are held jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation amount. ISSUE NO.3: 21.Burden to prove this issue was upon respondent no.3- Insurance Company, but no evidence has been led to prove this issue. Hence, this issue is decided against respondent no.3. Relief: 22.In view of above discussion and findings on the issues, the claim petition is partly allowed. A sum of Rs.1,70,903/- is awarded in favour of petitioner. Petitioner shall also get interest on the awarded amount at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of institution of the KHAJANI DEVI VERSUS RAJESH KUMAR & OTHERS 12 petition till payment.

My findings on the above issues are as under: ISSUE NO.1: 10.Burden to prove this issue was upon claimant. Ld. counsel for claimant relied upon the statement of claimant Khajani Devi, who KHAJANI DEVI VERSUS RAJESH KUMAR & OTHERS 6 appeared as PW1 and tendered her affidavit Ex.PW1/A in her evidence, wherein she deposed that 20.04.2015 she was coming from Karnal to her house at Panchkula via Ambala Cantt. by Car bearing registration no.HR14K/7891 being driven by her husband and when they reached near Reebok Showroom, situated at NH-1, G.T. Road, Ambala Cantt, a Canter bearing registration no.HR37C/0961 being driven by respondent no.1 at high speed without observing traffic rules came from behind and while overtaking the car, hit against right portion of the Car, resultantly, both vehicles turned turtle. She further deposed that Car got badly damaged and claimant sustained simple and grievous injuries including fractures and that she alongwith her husband was shifted to Government Hospital, Ambala Cantt., where, after conducting her MLR, she was referred to General Hospital, Sector-6, Panchkula, where she was admitted on 21.4.2015 at 2.15 AM and was discharged on 26.4.2015 and that she also got treatment from ALCHEMIST Hospital, Sector-21, Panchkula.

Although there is delay of only one day in registration of the FIR, but delay is not fatal to the case of petitioner, as it is clear from FIR that information qua accident was received telephonically in Police Station on the same day, but patient was unfit for making statement. In a case of accident, immediate treatment of the patient is necessary and it is not required that the injured shall be taken to Police Station at first instance for registration of the case. It is clear from record that Number of the vehicle is mentioned in the FIR. It is also matter of record that after investigation of the case, final report Ex.P10 was submitted in Court and vide charge sheet dated 17.8.2015 Ex.P13, respondent no.1 Rajesh Kumar was charge sheeted for commission of offences punishable u/Ss.279, 337, 338 IPC. 12.In view of above discussion, it is held that claimant has successfully proved that accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving Canter bearing registration no.HR37C/0961 in a rash and negligent manner, wherein she sustained injuries. Hence, Issue no.1 is decided in favour of petitioner.

She further deposed that she also got treatment from Alchemist Hospital, Sector 21, Panchkula and is still under treatment. She further deposed that she spent Rs.2,50,000/- on treatment, expenses, special diet, transportation and attendant charges etc. She further deposed that at the time of accident, her age was 54 years and due to injuries suffered in the accident, she remained confined to bed and so suffered loss of income. It is case of claimant that she suffered loss of 32 days' salary, as she will not get leave encashment of 300 days as per her entitlement, due to the fact that her available leaves for encashment are less than 300. 14.In order to prove her hospitalization, petitioner examined Dr. Monika Bali, Medical Officer, General Hospital, Sector-6, Panchkula as PW3, who deposed that patient Khajani Devi wife of Rajbir Singh was admitted in the Hospital on 21.4.2015 at 2.15 AM with history of roadside accident and that she was discharged on 26.4.2015.

She further deposed that patient was advised four weeks' rest w.e.f. 26.4.2015 by Orthopaedic OPD Doctor, as per record. 15.From the statement of PW3, it is clear that after the accident, claimant took treatment from General Hospital, Sector-6, Panchkula. Considering the statements of PW1 and PW3, the documents placed on record regarding her treatment and amount spent on her treatment as Ex.P7, Ex.P8, Ex.P17, Ex.P28 to Ex.P48, Mark-A to Mark-D are easily believable, there being no reason to disbelieve the same, since ld. counsel for respondents have not disputed the same.

KHAJANI DEVI VERSUS RAJESH KUMAR & OTHERS 7 11.As per record of the case, accident occurred on 20.4.2015 at 7.30 PM and FIR was registered on 21.4.2015 at 12.35 AM. Although there is delay of only one day in registration of the FIR, but delay is not fatal to the case of petitioner, as it is clear from FIR that information qua accident was received telephonically in Police Station on the same day, but patient was unfit for making statement. In a case of accident, immediate treatment of the patient is necessary and it is not required that the injured shall be taken to Police Station at first instance for registration of the case. It is clear from record that Number of the vehicle is mentioned in the FIR. It is also matter of record that after investigation of the case, final report Ex.P10 was submitted in Court and vide charge sheet dated 17.8.2015 Ex.P13, respondent no.1 Rajesh Kumar was charge sheeted for commission of offences punishable u/Ss.279, 337, 338 IPC. 12.In view of above discussion, it is held that claimant has successfully proved that accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving Canter bearing registration no.HR37C/0961 in a rash and negligent manner, wherein she sustained injuries. Hence, Issue no.1 is decided in favour of petitioner. ISSUE NO.2: 13.In this case, compensation has been claimed by petitioner on account of injuries suffered by her in the accident in question and the amount spent by her on her treatment, attendant charges, pain and suffering, loss of income etc. While appearing as PW1, petitioner in her affidavit Ex.PW1/A deposed that she suffered fracture in left shoulder, KHAJANI DEVI VERSUS RAJESH KUMAR & OTHERS 8 collar bone, right hand wrist and also suffered injuries on left side of her head. She further deposed that she received multiple, simple and grievous injuries on her person in the accident. She further deposed that she suffered loss of vision due to head injury suffered by her in the accident and that immediately after the accident, she was shifted to Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt. in a private vehicle, from where she was referred to General Hospital, Sector-6, Panchkula, where she remained admitted from 21.4.2015 to 26.4.2015. She further deposed that she also got treatment from Alchemist Hospital, Sector 21, Panchkula and is still under treatment. She further deposed that she spent Rs.2,50,000/- on treatment, expenses, special diet, transportation and attendant charges etc. She further deposed that at the time of accident, her age was 54 years and due to injuries suffered in the accident, she remained confined to bed and so suffered loss of income. It is case of claimant that she suffered loss of 32 days' salary, as she will not get leave encashment of 300 days as per her entitlement, due to the fact that her available leaves for encashment are less than 300. 14.In order to prove her hospitalization, petitioner examined Dr. Monika Bali, Medical Officer, General Hospital, Sector-6, Panchkula as PW3, who deposed that patient Khajani Devi wife of Rajbir Singh was admitted in the Hospital on 21.4.2015 at 2.15 AM with history of roadside accident and that she was discharged on 26.4.2015. She further deposed that patient was treated by other Specialist and consultation was done by Orthopaedician, Surgeon, Eye-Surgeon, ENT Surgeon and she was KHAJANI DEVI VERSUS RAJESH KUMAR & OTHERS 9 advised Neurology opinion also. She further deposed that patient had sustained fractures on both bones of right arm and fracture in left collar bone. She deposed that patient was operated upon on 21.4.2015 by Dr. Modi, Ortho-paedician and proved original Discharge Card Ex.P6 and cash receipts Ex.P7 and Ex.P8. She further proved photocopy of operation record Mark-A, photocopy of Nurses Medication Chart Mark-B, TRP BP Chart Mark-C. She further deposed that patient was advised four weeks' rest w.e.f. 26.4.2015 by Orthopaedic OPD Doctor, as per record. 15.From the statement of PW3, it is clear that after the accident, claimant took treatment from General Hospital, Sector-6, Panchkula. Considering the statements of PW1 and PW3, the documents placed on record regarding her treatment and amount spent on her treatment as Ex.P7, Ex.P8, Ex.P17, Ex.P28 to Ex.P48, Mark-A to Mark-D are easily believable, there being no reason to disbelieve the same, since ld. counsel for respondents have not disputed the same. Accordingly, Rs.25,903/- (as shown in Ex.P7, Ex.P8, Ex.P17, Ex.P28 to Ex.P48) is awarded under the head of medical bills and hospitalization charges. 16.It is case of petitioner that she has become permanently disabled due to the injuries suffered in the accident. She placed on record copy of Discharge Certificate dated 30.9.2015 as Ex.P14. Medical Certificate Ex.P14 is the original Certificate issued by Medical Board consisting of three Doctors of General Hospital, Sector-6, Panchkula and there is no reason to disbelieve the same. As per Medical Certificate Ex.P14, claimant suffered permanent disability to the extent of 10%. KHAJANI DEVI VERSUS RAJESH KUMAR & OTHERS 10 Accordingly, Rs.20,000/- (Rs.2000/- per percent disability) is awarded to claimant under the head of permanent disability. 17.The petitioner has also claimed compensation under the head of loss of income. It is case of petitioner that she availed 32 days' earned leaves when she was under treatment, thus she is entitled to get compensation on account of loss of income. 18.PW2 Ram Ratti Devi, Clerk in Government Senior Secondary School, Ramgarh, District Panchkula, brought record of petitioner Khajani Devi. The petitioner is employed as Government Teacher in Government Senior Secondary School, Ramgarh, District Panchkula. PW2 proved Salary Certificate Ex.P1 and Ex.P2 of petitioner. She deposed that petitioner remained on leave from 21.4.2015 to 22.5.2015 and proved leave record Ex.P4. She further deposed that petitioner availed 32 earned leaves during her treatment. She further deposed that a Teacher gets ten earned leaves per year. In view of statement of PW2 and record of this case, an employee is entitled to get leave encashment of 300 earned leaves and it is matter of record that petitioner will retire in 2018 and even if she will get ten earned leaves every year, even then total earned leaves will be less than 300 and so she will suffer a loss of salary of 32 days, as she would have availed encashment of 32 days earned leave. Considering the fact that she availed 32 days' earned leave during her treatment and the fact that Basic Pay, Grade Pay and D.A. for a month as on today, this Tribunal considers it appropriate to award Rs.70,000/- under the head of loss of income due to KHAJANI DEVI VERSUS RAJESH KUMAR & OTHERS 11 availing of earned leave. 19.The petitioner has claimed compensation on account of loss of vision, but no Eye Specialist has been examined in order to corroborate her version. Only an Eye Specialist can depose whether the problem faced by petitioner is a result of injuries sustained in the accident in question. Considering the facts of the case, this Tribunal considers it appropriate to award Rs.25,000/- under the head of pain and suffering, Rs.15,000/- under the head of attendant charges, Rs.5000/- under the head of special diet, Rs.10,000/- under the head of transportation charges. In total, Rs.1,70,903/- is awarded in favour of petitioner. 20.Admittedly, Canter bearing registration no.HR37C/0961 was insured with respondent no.3 on the date of accident vide Policy No.35350131140100001431, effective from 19.6.2014 to 18.6.2015 issued by respondent no.3. Hence, all respondents are held jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation amount. ISSUE NO.3: 21.Burden to prove this issue was upon respondent no.3- Insurance Company, but no evidence has been led to prove this issue. Hence, this issue is decided against respondent no.3. Relief: 22.In view of above discussion and findings on the issues, the claim petition is partly allowed. A sum of Rs.1,70,903/- is awarded in favour of petitioner. Petitioner shall also get interest on the awarded amount at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of institution of the KHAJANI DEVI VERSUS RAJESH KUMAR & OTHERS 12 petition till payment.

On the basis of pleadings of the KHAJANI DEVI VERSUS RAJESH KUMAR & OTHERS 5 parties, following issues were framed: 1Whether the accident in question took place by rash and negligent driving of Canter bearing registration no.HR37C/0961 by respondent no.1 resulting into injuries to Khajani Devi as alleged? OPP 2If issue no.1 is proved, then whether the claimant is entitled to compensation, if so, how much and from whom?

OPR (3) 4Relief 6.In order to prove her case, petitioner herself stepped as PW1, examined Ram Ratti Devi as PW2 and Dr. Monika Bali as PW3. In documentary evidence, documents Ex.P9 to Ex.P48, Mark-D to Mark-F were tendered. 7.On the other hand, no oral or documentary evidence was led by respondents. 8.No rebuttal evidence was led. 9.I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the material pleadings, evidence and the legal proposition applicable to the present case. My findings on the above issues are as under: ISSUE NO.1: 10.Burden to prove this issue was upon claimant. Ld. counsel for claimant relied upon the statement of claimant Khajani Devi, who KHAJANI DEVI VERSUS RAJESH KUMAR & OTHERS 6 appeared as PW1 and tendered her affidavit Ex.PW1/A in her evidence, wherein she deposed that 20.04.2015 she was coming from Karnal to her house at Panchkula via Ambala Cantt. by Car bearing registration no.HR14K/7891 being driven by her husband and when they reached near Reebok Showroom, situated at NH-1, G.T. Road, Ambala Cantt, a Canter bearing registration no.HR37C/0961 being driven by respondent no.1 at high speed without observing traffic rules came from behind and while overtaking the car, hit against right portion of the Car, resultantly, both vehicles turned turtle. She further deposed that Car got badly damaged and claimant sustained simple and grievous injuries including fractures and that she alongwith her husband was shifted to Government Hospital, Ambala Cantt., where, after conducting her MLR, she was referred to General Hospital, Sector-6, Panchkula, where she was admitted on 21.4.2015 at 2.15 AM and was discharged on 26.4.2015 and that she also got treatment from ALCHEMIST Hospital, Sector-21, Panchkula. She further deposed that she spent more than Rs.2,50,000/- on attendant, special diet, transportation, treatment etc. and remained confined to bed for around 32 days, thereby suffering loss of 32 days' leave encashment of more than Rs.1,00,000/- on retirement at rate of last drawn salary. She further deposed that criminal case was registered against respondent no.1 in Police Station Parao, Ambala Cantt. and that accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving Canter bearing registration no.HR37C/0961 in a rash and negligent manner. She was cross examined at length, but there is nothing on record to disbelieve her version. KHAJANI DEVI VERSUS RAJESH KUMAR & OTHERS 7 11.As per record of the case, accident occurred on 20.4.2015 at 7.30 PM and FIR was registered on 21.4.2015 at 12.35 AM. Although there is delay of only one day in registration of the FIR, but delay is not fatal to the case of petitioner, as it is clear from FIR that information qua accident was received telephonically in Police Station on the same day, but patient was unfit for making statement. In a case of accident, immediate treatment of the patient is necessary and it is not required that the injured shall be taken to Police Station at first instance for registration of the case. It is clear from record that Number of the vehicle is mentioned in the FIR. It is also matter of record that after investigation of the case, final report Ex.P10 was submitted in Court and vide charge sheet dated 17.8.2015 Ex.P13, respondent no.1 Rajesh Kumar was charge sheeted for commission of offences punishable u/Ss.279, 337, 338 IPC. 12.In view of above discussion, it is held that claimant has successfully proved that accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving Canter bearing registration no.HR37C/0961 in a rash and negligent manner, wherein she sustained injuries. Hence, Issue no.1 is decided in favour of petitioner. ISSUE NO.2: 13.In this case, compensation has been claimed by petitioner on account of injuries suffered by her in the accident in question and the amount spent by her on her treatment, attendant charges, pain and suffering, loss of income etc. While appearing as PW1, petitioner in her affidavit Ex.PW1/A deposed that she suffered fracture in left shoulder, KHAJANI DEVI VERSUS RAJESH KUMAR & OTHERS 8 collar bone, right hand wrist and also suffered injuries on left side of her head. She further deposed that she received multiple, simple and grievous injuries on her person in the accident. She further deposed that she suffered loss of vision due to head injury suffered by her in the accident and that immediately after the accident, she was shifted to Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt. in a private vehicle, from where she was referred to General Hospital, Sector-6, Panchkula, where she remained admitted from 21.4.2015 to 26.4.2015. She further deposed that she also got treatment from Alchemist Hospital, Sector 21, Panchkula and is still under treatment. She further deposed that she spent Rs.2,50,000/- on treatment, expenses, special diet, transportation and attendant charges etc. She further deposed that at the time of accident, her age was 54 years and due to injuries suffered in the accident, she remained confined to bed and so suffered loss of income. It is case of claimant that she suffered loss of 32 days' salary, as she will not get leave encashment of 300 days as per her entitlement, due to the fact that her available leaves for encashment are less than 300. 14.In order to prove her hospitalization, petitioner examined Dr. Monika Bali, Medical Officer, General Hospital, Sector-6, Panchkula as PW3, who deposed that patient Khajani Devi wife of Rajbir Singh was admitted in the Hospital on 21.4.2015 at 2.15 AM with history of roadside accident and that she was discharged on 26.4.2015. She further deposed that patient was treated by other Specialist and consultation was done by Orthopaedician, Surgeon, Eye-Surgeon, ENT Surgeon and she was KHAJANI DEVI VERSUS RAJESH KUMAR & OTHERS 9 advised Neurology opinion also. She further deposed that patient had sustained fractures on both bones of right arm and fracture in left collar bone. She deposed that patient was operated upon on 21.4.2015 by Dr. Modi, Ortho-paedician and proved original Discharge Card Ex.P6 and cash receipts Ex.P7 and Ex.P8. She further proved photocopy of operation record Mark-A, photocopy of Nurses Medication Chart Mark-B, TRP BP Chart Mark-C. She further deposed that patient was advised four weeks' rest w.e.f. 26.4.2015 by Orthopaedic OPD Doctor, as per record. 15.From the statement of PW3, it is clear that after the accident, claimant took treatment from General Hospital, Sector-6, Panchkula. Considering the statements of PW1 and PW3, the documents placed on record regarding her treatment and amount spent on her treatment as Ex.P7, Ex.P8, Ex.P17, Ex.P28 to Ex.P48, Mark-A to Mark-D are easily believable, there being no reason to disbelieve the same, since ld. counsel for respondents have not disputed the same. Accordingly, Rs.25,903/- (as shown in Ex.P7, Ex.P8, Ex.P17, Ex.P28 to Ex.P48) is awarded under the head of medical bills and hospitalization charges. 16.It is case of petitioner that she has become permanently disabled due to the injuries suffered in the accident. She placed on record copy of Discharge Certificate dated 30.9.2015 as Ex.P14. Medical Certificate Ex.P14 is the original Certificate issued by Medical Board consisting of three Doctors of General Hospital, Sector-6, Panchkula and there is no reason to disbelieve the same. As per Medical Certificate Ex.P14, claimant suffered permanent disability to the extent of 10%. KHAJANI DEVI VERSUS RAJESH KUMAR & OTHERS 10 Accordingly, Rs.20,000/- (Rs.2000/- per percent disability) is awarded to claimant under the head of permanent disability. 17.The petitioner has also claimed compensation under the head of loss of income. It is case of petitioner that she availed 32 days' earned leaves when she was under treatment, thus she is entitled to get compensation on account of loss of income. 18.PW2 Ram Ratti Devi, Clerk in Government Senior Secondary School, Ramgarh, District Panchkula, brought record of petitioner Khajani Devi. The petitioner is employed as Government Teacher in Government Senior Secondary School, Ramgarh, District Panchkula. PW2 proved Salary Certificate Ex.P1 and Ex.P2 of petitioner. She deposed that petitioner remained on leave from 21.4.2015 to 22.5.2015 and proved leave record Ex.P4. She further deposed that petitioner availed 32 earned leaves during her treatment. She further deposed that a Teacher gets ten earned leaves per year. In view of statement of PW2 and record of this case, an employee is entitled to get leave encashment of 300 earned leaves and it is matter of record that petitioner will retire in 2018 and even if she will get ten earned leaves every year, even then total earned leaves will be less than 300 and so she will suffer a loss of salary of 32 days, as she would have availed encashment of 32 days earned leave. Considering the fact that she availed 32 days' earned leave during her treatment and the fact that Basic Pay, Grade Pay and D.A. for a month as on today, this Tribunal considers it appropriate to award Rs.70,000/- under the head of loss of income due to KHAJANI DEVI VERSUS RAJESH KUMAR & OTHERS 11 availing of earned leave. 19.The petitioner has claimed compensation on account of loss of vision, but no Eye Specialist has been examined in order to corroborate her version. Only an Eye Specialist can depose whether the problem faced by petitioner is a result of injuries sustained in the accident in question. Considering the facts of the case, this Tribunal considers it appropriate to award Rs.25,000/- under the head of pain and suffering, Rs.15,000/- under the head of attendant charges, Rs.5000/- under the head of special diet, Rs.10,000/- under the head of transportation charges. In total, Rs.1,70,903/- is awarded in favour of petitioner. 20.Admittedly, Canter bearing registration no.HR37C/0961 was insured with respondent no.3 on the date of accident vide Policy No.35350131140100001431, effective from 19.6.2014 to 18.6.2015 issued by respondent no.3. Hence, all respondents are held jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation amount. ISSUE NO.3: 21.Burden to prove this issue was upon respondent no.3- Insurance Company, but no evidence has been led to prove this issue. Hence, this issue is decided against respondent no.3. Relief: 22.In view of above discussion and findings on the issues, the claim petition is partly allowed. A sum of Rs.1,70,903/- is awarded in favour of petitioner. Petitioner shall also get interest on the awarded amount at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of institution of the KHAJANI DEVI VERSUS RAJESH KUMAR & OTHERS 12 petition till payment.

Shri Anil Kumar Kaushik, Advocate for respondent No.1 &2. Shri R.K.Vig, Advocate for respondent No.3. AWARD:- This claim petition is being preferred u/s 166 of MV Act seeking compensation of Rs.6 lacs on account of total damage of Swift D- Zire Car No. HR-06-V-0266 in a Motor Vehicular Accident, which took place on 20.08.2015, at about 05:30 p.m, in the area of Police Station PARVEEN KUMAR VS MUKESH KUMAR ETC 2 Parao and FIR bearing No. 0201 dated 20.08.2015 u/ss 279, 337 and 427 of IPC was registered against respondent no.1. 2The necessary facts leading to accident in question are that on 20.08.2015, the claimant was going from Ambala City to Ambala Cantt by driving Swift D-Zire Car No. HR-06-V-0266, in the company of his friend namely Mohinder, on his correct left hand side of the road at normal speed. When at about 5.30 PM they were a short about 1.5 KM from the bridge of Kali Palton on Rajpura to Ambala Cantt, G. T. Road, At that time, a Canter/ Truck bearing registration No. HR-45-B-1261 lying stationary on the mid of the road, without twinkling any indicator, parking lights on, without observing traffic rules, without caring other vehicles plying on the road and more so without standing any person, who should suggest the road users that the offending stationary canter/ truck is lying on the road in such a dangerous condition, consequently, the car of the claimant struck with that stationary canter/ truck resulting into complete damage of the car and occupants also suffered injuries. This accident took place due to sole rash and negligent driving of truck bearing registration No. HR-45-B-1261 by respondent no.1 Mukesh Kumar. The said car was badly damaged beyond repair in this accident. The loss of worth Rs. 4,76,295.46 has been assessed by M/s Modern Automobiles Ambala City. However, the claimant has suffered a loss of Rs.6,00,000/- for damage of the vehicle. The offending vehicle on the day of accident was owned by respondent No.2 and insured with respondent no.3, therefore, all respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the PARVEEN KUMAR VS MUKESH KUMAR ETC 3 compensation. 3Upon notice, respondents no.1 and 2 filed joint written statement. They took preliminary objection regarding maintainability and petition is bad for non joinder of necessary parties. On merit, it is submitted that the accident took place due to the own negligence of the claimant while driving his car. The police has registered a false case at the instance of the claimant and his companions. However, in the FIR, the different vehicle number is mentioned. Any-how, the driver, owner and insurer of car bearing registration No. HR-06/V-0266 are also the necessary parties. It is further submitted that the amount claimed is highly excessive; that claimant has cooked up a false story; that the truck-canter bearing registration No. HR-45-B-1261 got mechanical fault and was standing on the side of the road, indicators were twinkling and parking lights were on and even that calendar (helper) of the truck was standing near the truck, who was indicating/ directing the other vehicles and the branches and bricks were placed around the truck and thus all the traffic rules were observed, but the driver of car bearing registration No. HR- 06/V-0266 while driving his car in a very high speed and in rash and negligent manner, came from behind and himself struck his car with the standing truck of the answering respondents and even the driver of the car was under the influence of some intoxicants and due to his own negligence, the car struck with the truck of the answering respondents, there was no negligence on the part of the answering respondents, but as the vehicle of the answering respondents was heavy than the car of the PARVEEN KUMAR VS MUKESH KUMAR ETC 4 claimant, therefore, the claimant at the instance of his companions in order to save himself falsely got registered the case against the respondent No.1. The respondent No.1 had clearly told all these facts before the Investigating Officer during investigation and in the light of facts, the answering respondents are quite innocent persons and prayed for dismissal the same with costs. 4Respondent No.3 Insurance Company filed written statement controverting the contents made in the petition and took preliminary objections regarding maintainability, cause of action; that the claim is bad by the principles of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence; that the driver of the Truck No. HR-45-B-1261 was not having a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the accident or further was not qualified or obtaining such driving license and has not satisfied the requirement of the Rule No.3 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 and therefore, has contravened the breach of the terms and conditions of the alleged insurance policy; that the respondent reserves its right to take all defences and pleas available under section 148, 149 (2), 167,169 and 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and in terms of the insurance policy. On merit, it is submitted that there is placed no record regarding ownership of car in question and damage of vehicle coupled with record by the claimant. However, a false and frivolous FIR No.201 dated 20.08.2015 was lodged in order to get compensation from the answering respondent. It is wrong that Swift Car No. D-Zire HR-06-V- 0266 has been badly damaged in the alleged accident or that Modern PARVEEN KUMAR VS MUKESH KUMAR ETC 5 Automobiles has assessed the loss worth Rs.4,76,295.46/- for the repair of his damage vehicle. The truck No. HR-45-B-1261 was never involved in any accident. It is further submitted that the insurance particulars of the alleged vehicle has not been verified from the issuing authority, so at this stage, it is not admitted but the liability of the company, if any, is subject to the provisions of M. V . Act and also terms and conditions thereof. However, amount claimed as compensation is much more exaggerated and imaginary one. The FIR was registered by manipulating the wrong facts in order to get huge compensation from the answering respondent. The claim petition has been filed after due consultation just to get compensation from the answering respondent on purely made up basis which is not sustainable in the eyes of law. Rests of facts are denied and prayed for dismissal the petitions with special costs. 5Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following issues are framed vide order dated 23.03.2016:- 1Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1 while driving a Truck/Canter bearing registration No. HR-45-B-1261 resulting into causing damage to Swift Car bearing registration No. HR-06-V-0266 belonging to claimant Parveen Kumar, as alleged ? OPP. 2If Issue No 1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom, the claimant is entitled to ? OPP. 3Whether petition is not maintainable in the present form ? OPR 4Whether the petition is bad for non joinder of necessary parties ? OPR 5Whether the petition is bad by the principles of PARVEEN KUMAR VS MUKESH KUMAR ETC 6 estoppel, waiver and acquiescence ? OPR 6Whether petitioner has no cause of action to file the present petition ? OPR 7Whether respondent No.1 was not having a valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accidence ? OPR 8Whether respondent No.3 is entitled to take all the defences available to it under the M. V . Act ? OPR 9Relief 6 To establish his claim through this inquiry, in evidence, claimant stepped into witness box as PW1 and tendered affidavit Ex.PW1/A reiterating the contents mentioned in the petition. He also tendered documents Ex.P1 to Ex.P3 and Mark-A in his evidence. In cross-examination, he answered that he purchased Swift D-zire Car No. HR-06-0266 from Harish Kumar in the year 2015. He had paid Rs.3,80,000/- in cash to previous owner at the time of purchase. His car was not insured with any insurance company at the time of accident. It is correct that it is mandatory to get the vehicle insured at the time of plying on the road. He cannot tell the insured declared value of his car. It is correct that every year depreciation value of the car has been reduced. He did not get his damaged vehicle assessed from any authorized surveyor. V olunteered, he got his vehicle serviced estimate from Modern Automobiles, Ambala City. He got clicked the photographs of his vehicle of his own. His vehicle was also got mechanically checked by the police and no photograph was clicked in his presence by the police. He is doing agricultural work. He is PARVEEN KUMAR VS MUKESH KUMAR ETC 7 permanent resident of Village Mastpur but now he is residing at House No.2164-65 Sector-10 Ambala City. He was also cross-examined on other questions. PW2 Pawan Kumar , Body Shop Manager, Modern Automobiles, Ambala City stated that he had prepared service estimate Ex.P4 of Vehicle No. HR-06-V-0266 Swift Dzire on 27.10.2015 and identified his signatures thereof. In cross-examination, he answered that he is working in Modern Automobiles for the last 13 years. He is not having any diploma in any automobiles services. Ex.P4 is just a service estimate. The vehicle in question was not repaired by their workshop. He cannot say whether the vehicle has been repaired by the owner from outside or not. He cannot say whether the vehicle was insured with any insurance company or not. Police never recorded his statement. It is correct that every year depreciation has been deducted as per policy terms. It is also correct that if vehicle comes within the definition of 4-5 years, depreciation value of the vehicle will be assessed at 50 percent. It is correct that depreciation of the parts of the vehicle will be 50 percent after 5 years of the purchase of the vehicle. It is correct that in general claim will be paid insured declared value of the vehicle in question if service estimate amount increase to the IDV value of the vehicle. He cannot tell the IDV value of the vehicle in question in the year 2015. Thereafter, learned counsel for claimant tendered copy of charge sheet as Ex.P5; copy of report under section 173 Cr.P.C as Ex.P6, release order of the damaged vehicle No. HR-06-V-0266 as Ex.P7 and closed the claimant PARVEEN KUMAR VS MUKESH KUMAR ETC 8 evidence. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent No. 1 and 2 tendered documents Mark-A copy of DL of respondent No1; Mark-B copy of RC; Mark-C copy of receipt; Mark-D copy of payment book; Mark-E copy of route permit; Mark-F copy of authorization certificate; Mark-G copy of receipt; Mark-H copy of insurance policy and closed his evidence. Learned counsel for respondent No.3 tendered documents Ex.R1 Form-A; Ex.R2 postal receipt; Ex.R3 postal order receipt; Ex.R4 application under RTI Act; Ex.R5 envelope; Ex.R6 Insurance policy; Ex.R7 copy of DL of respondent No.1 and closed the evidence. No rebuttal evidence was led and closed on 01.08.2016. 7I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1: 8Onus to prove this issue is upon claimant. Under this issue, petitioner- claimant is required to establish that motor vehicular accident was occurred due to sole rash and negligent act of respondent No.1 while parking his vehicle without observing any traffic rules. Learned counsel for claimant has argued that respondent No.1 had parked his vehicle bearing registration No. HR-45-B-1261 without adopting any preventive safety measure and without observing rules and therefore his Swift D-zire Car No. HR-06-0266 vehicle of claimant rammed into standing truck, as a result of that, it was totally damaged. He further argued that FIR Ex.P1 was lodged and on culmination of investigation, final report was also PARVEEN KUMAR VS MUKESH KUMAR ETC 9 submitted against respondent No.1 who has been facing trial under sections 279, 337 and 427 of IPC as per charge sheet Ex.P5 on file and so factum of rash and negligent act of the respondent No.1 is proved and prayed for deciding this issue in favour of claimant. In support to his contentions, he has placed reliance upon case laws. In Saudagarsing Chhajusing and Others Vs. Jashodaben and another, 1986 ACJ 1070, it has been observed that Leaving vehicle in a dangerous position- Negligence-Contributory negligence- Collision between a stationary truck-trailer and motor cycle- Truck-trailer parked on national high way when it was dark without any indication, reflector or parking lights- Motor-cyclist dazzled by the lights of another truck coming from the opposite direction collided with the stationary truck-trailer- Opposite parties contended that motorcycle was driven without proper look out as it collided with a stationary vehicle and there was contributory negligence of the motor-cyclist- Whether truck driver was negligent in parking his vehicle without putting any signal to indicate its presence- Held: Yes: he is solely responsible for the accident and there is no contributory negligence of the deceased motor-cyclist. In Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993(2) P.L.R. 109 wherein it has been observed that Negligence- Driver was being tried on account of rash and negligent driving- Prima Facie safe to conclude that the accident occurred on account of rash and negligent driving of the driver. In Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd Vs. Smt. Manohari and others, 2012 (2) T.A.C., 459 (Rajasthan), it has been observed that Negligence- Offending vehicle standing in middle of road PARVEEN KUMAR VS MUKESH KUMAR ETC 10 and did not bear any rear lights- Collision of jeep with stationary truck on road- Finding of gross negligence on part of truck driver does not require any interference. 9 On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent no.3 has vehemently argued that claimant was driving his Swift D-zire Car No. HR-06-0266 in a very high speed and despite watching standing truck at a distance of 15 sq feet, claimant did not control over the vehicle by using brakes and rammed the vehicle directly into standing truck. He further argued that claimant was neither overtaking any vehicle nor offending vehicle was parked in the middle of the road, rather it was four lane road and offending vehicle was standing a side and it was a day light at about 5.30 PM in month of August, and so false and frivolous FIR was lodged due to extract compensation from the Insurance company and prayed for deciding this issue against the claimant. In support to his contentions, he placed reliance upon following authorities:- In The New India Assurance Co.Ltd. Vs. Smt. Harbans Kaur and others, 2010 (4) PLR 422 , it has been observed that Negligence- If there was a parked vehicle and still there had been a collision, it is normally be taken only that the vehicle, which was dashed against the parked vehicle, was responsible for the accident- The aggravating circumstance could be when the parked vehicle had been parked inappropriately at the middle of the road or without adequate parking lights- Truck had been parked without adequate signs or parking lights and therefore, the car driver could not avoid hitting the truck at the PARVEEN KUMAR VS MUKESH KUMAR ETC 11 last minute in his attempt to save himself from hitting the oncoming vehicle- On the rival contentions of the parties, the Tribunal has apportioned the liability as 60:40-Upheld. In Jaspal Kaur and others Vs. Sachkhand Bricks Gram Udyog and others, 2013 (4) PLR 489 , it has been observed that Negligence- It is a case where the deceased was driving his scooter and he had hit the back side of a truck, which was standing parked- There is no evidence on record that the truck was parked on the metalled road- Some portion of it might have been there on the metalled road but at the same time there is no iota of evidence to prove that any other vehicle at the time of the accident was coming from the opposite side having head lights in high beam by which the deceased was blinded and he could not see the truck- In these circumstance, learned Tribunal has rightly taken it to be a case of contributory negligence where responsibility for the accident is equal on both the deceased and respondent. In Subhash Chand and Others Vs. Satya Rani and others, 2014 ACJ 2362 , it has been observed that Negligence- Contributory negligence- Hitting from behind- Scooterist rammed his scooter against tractor-tailer going ahead when tractor driver suddenly applied brakes and scooterist sustained fatal injuries- Tractor driver deposed that at the relevant time tractor was parked on kacha berm of the road and accident resulted from reckless driving of the scooterist- Eyewitness deposed that collision happened when tractor driver suddenly applied brakes and scooterist rammed against the tractor- A person who rammed his vehicle against back of another vehicle going ahead ought to be taken as a person PARVEEN KUMAR VS MUKESH KUMAR ETC 12 contributing to the accident- Tribunal was not justified in casting entire responsibility for the accident only on tractor driver- Held: both tractor driver and scooterist were equally negligent in causing the accident. 10I have given thoughtful consideration to the rival contentions put forth by learned counsel for respective parties and have perused the entire evidence carefully. After thorough examination, it is observed that canter/truck was standing on the side of road and so drivers of vehicle plying on the road ought to have taken precaution while driving their vehicle, but it reflects that due to over speed of claimant's car, he could not take extra precaution while driving his Swift D-zire Car No. HR-06- 0266 on the road, rather, he directly rammed his car from behind in to the standing truck in day light. Had it been the case of claimant that he was driving his vehicle in night and truck was standing without twinkling indicator etc, then it would be on different footing but here, it is the case of claimant that alleged accident took place at 5.30 PM in the month of August 2015 and if claimant being driver of the car was not in a position to control over his car from the distance of 15 feet which was noticed prior to accident, then it would certainly establish that speed of his car was very high and so claimant remained unable to control over the speed and directly rammed his car into standing truck from behind in day light particularly when no vehicle was overtaking at that time. 11 It would be appropriate to mention here that claimant had purchased second hand swift D-zire car bearing registration No. HR-06- 0266 in a sum of Rs.3,80,000/- from its previous owner, but he did not get PARVEEN KUMAR VS MUKESH KUMAR ETC 13 insured of said car reason best known to him. If claimant purchased second hand car in the year 2015 and did not get it insured from any insurance company, then it shall show the negligent act of claimant while plying the vehicle without getting it insured at his own risk and responsibility. Needless to state that it was/is mandatory for claimant to get the vehicle insured at the time of plying on the road, but claimant himself admitted that he did not insure the vehicle and as such he also violated the provisions of law. So question of rash and negligent act at the behest of Respondent No.1 while standing truck aside the four lane road could not be established which may impose contributory liabilities rather as per evidence it was negligent act at the behest of claimant while rammed his car into standing truck due to over speed etc. The solitary statement of PW1 Parveen Kumar is not found sufficient to prove rash and negligent act at the behest of respondent No.1. It may not be out of place to mention here that mere lodging FIR and submission of final report under section 173 Cr.P.C would not be held liable the respondent No.1 to pay compensation for rash and negligent act, rather, criminal act is required to be proved beyond shadow of the reasonable doubt before trial court and here claimant is required to establish rash and negligent act on the basis of balance of probabilities and preponderance which tilts in favour of respondent no.1 and so claimant has failed to establish this issue against the respondent No.1. Accordingly, this issue is decided against the claimant. ISSUE NO.2: PARVEEN KUMAR VS MUKESH KUMAR ETC 14 12Onus to prove this issue is upon claimant. It has already decided Issue No.1 against claimant, therefore, question of assessment of compensation amount do not arise having become infractous in eyes of law. However, I would like to point out the fact that claimant was plying his swift D-zire car bearing registration No. HR-06-0266 without getting it insured from the Insurance company. Further, claimant has simply produced estimate Ex.P4 of damaged car, which was prepared by PW2 on 27.10.2015, though, alleged accident was taken place on 20.08.2015. If there was occurred any accident on 20.08.2015, then it was incumbent upon claimant to mechanically examine damaged vehicle immediately thereafter. However, it is not understandable as to why claimant got prepared only the estimate of his damaged vehicle from Modern Automobiles, Ambala City, after expiry of more than two months despite PW2 neither repaired the vehicle nor charged any amount etc. It is worth mentioning here that statement of PW2 is not found sufficient at all for assessing amount of compensation because his statement was never recorded by police nor Investigating Officer visited the workshop nor IO has been examined in this case. Not only this, claimant did not adduce any bills on account of repair of vehicle, which may corroborate the estimate prepared by PW2. Non production of bills on account of repair of damaged vehicle create strong doubt in the mind of this Tribunal to the extent that if vehicle of the claimant is insured with any insurance company and claimant submitted his bills to that company, who used to retain original bill while passing claim and if claimant got claim from his PARVEEN KUMAR VS MUKESH KUMAR ETC 15 own company on production of original bills which may be on very lessor side as compared to estimate and in absentia of original bills, it would be highly improbable for this Tribunal to assess compensation with regard to loss of damaged vehicle, which was being purchased by original previous owner in the year 2010 and every year depreciation of vehicle has to be deducted as per terms and conditions laid down by the Insurance company and if vehicle in questions comes within definition of five years then depreciation of vehicle would be assessed less than 50 per cent. Here, PW2 cannot tell the IDV value of the vehicle in question in the year 2015 and so without production of original bills of the damaged vehicle, it would not be justified to assess compensation proportionately . Accordingly, this issue is decided against claimant. ISSUE NO.3 to 5 & 7 : 13The onus to prove these issues is upon Respondents, but they neither pressed these issues nor led any evidence. Further it has been discussed in detail under issue no.1&2, that accident was not occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. It has become obvious for this tribunal that respondents failed to prove these issues and as such this tribunal has left with no other option except to decide the same against Respondents. Accordingly, these issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.6 14Onus to prove this issue is upon respondent No.3. Learned counsel for respondent No.3 has contended that respondent No.1 was not PARVEEN KUMAR VS MUKESH KUMAR ETC 16 holding valid DL which was being issued from Nagaland and so if any compensation is assessed in this claim petition then liability to pay compensation be imposed upon respondents No.1 and 2 and prayed for deciding this issue in favour of respondent No.3. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent No.1 and 2 has argued that no doubt DL Mark-A was being issued from Government of Nagaland, but same is neither fake nor procured, rather, offending vehicle in question is insured with respondent No.3 and so, respondents No. 1 and 2 are not sole liable to pay compensation if awarded. However, considering the findings rendered on Issues No.1 and 2, this issue has become redundant in eyes of law and same stands struck down. ISSUE NO.8 (RELIEF): PETITION FAILS 15In view of the foregoing discussion, instant claim petition stands dismissed with costs. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.3000/-.

AWARD:- Petitioner has brought this claim petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, for grant of compensation of Rs.60,00,000/- on SHEPAL SINGH VS. SATNAM SINGH ETC 2 account of injuries/permanent disability suffered by him in a road side accident, which was taken place on 26.11.2014 at about 03.30 PM and FIR No.114 dated 27.11.2014, u/ss 279 and 337 of IPC was registered against respondent No.1 at Police Station Naggal. 2The necessary facts leading to accident are that on 26.11.2014, Vijay Pal (brother of claimant) along-with Kanwar Pal Singh s/o Duni Chand attended the marriage in their relation in Sunrise Palace, Matheri Shekhan, Tehsil and District Ambala. After attending the marriage, claimant was going in his Swift Car bearing Registration No.HR-01AF-4600 and Vijay Pal Singh along-with Kanwar Pal started their journey to village Danipur. He was driving his car ahead the car of Vijay Pal Singh and at about, 03/03:30 PM, before village Naggal on Ambala-Hissar road, a truck bearing Registration No.HR-69-8597 'being driven by respondent no.1 on wrong side so rashly and negligently, came from Hisar side and hit the car of claimant and the impact was so hard that car of claimant revolved and then fell on the side of road. The said truck driver fled from the spot after leaving truck on the road side. The claimant was brought to the Civil Hospital, Ambala City in an ambulance by Kanwar Pal Singh and Vijay Pal Singh, thereafter, he was referred to Fortis Hospital, Mohali for further treatment. The s econd aspect of this claim petition are that before the accident, claimant was quite young man and married having two small school going kids and doing the agricultural work on his land and other SHEPAL SINGH VS.

The respondent No.2 is registered owner of the offending Car, which is insured with respondent No.3, hence, all respondents are equally liable to pay the amount of compensation to the claimant. 3Upon notice, respondent no.1 and 2 filed their written statement inter-alia on the preliminary objections with regard to maintainability; that claim petition is bad for mis-joinder and non-joinder of necessary party; that no accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of Truck bearing registration No.HR-69-8597 by respondent No.1.

OPR 8.Relief 6 In order to establish claim through this inquiry, in evidence, claimant examined following testimonies:- PW1 Dr. Deepika Garg tendered affidavit EX.PW1/A along-with copy of MLR EX.P1, copy of bed head ticket EX.P2 and copy of ruqa{ police information} EX.P3. In cross-examination, she answered that it is correct that MLR EX.P1 is of dated 28.11.2014. V olunteered, initially, the patient was brought to their hospital on 26.11.2014, however, seeing his critical condition, bed head ticket EX.P2 was prepared and the patient was referred to some higher medical institute and therefore, MLR could not be prepared on 26.11.2014. MLR dated 28.11.2014 was SHEPAL SINGH VS. SATNAM SINGH ETC 7 prepared, however, in the same date and time, arrival of patient in the hospital was mentioned as 26.11.2014. No name of any person in Column E of “brought by” has been mentioned in EX.P1 MLR. She was also cross-examined on other questions. PW2 HC Ranjit Singh has brought the summoned record of FIR No.114 dated 27.11.2014 u/ss 279, 337 and 338 of IPC. He was cross-examined. PW3 Vijay Pal (brother of claimant and eye witness of accident) tendered affidavit EX.PW3/A and FIR EX.P4 in his evidence. In cross-examination, he answered that he is real brother of claimant Sher Pal Singh. It is incorrect to suggest that he had come to help his brother (claimant). V olunteered, he is a summoned witness. On 26.11.2014 they had attended marriage at Sunrise Marriage Palace, Matheri. V olunteered, it was a family function and all relatives had come to attend the marriage ceremony. It is incorrect to suggest that hard drinks were being served in said ceremony and Sher Pal Singh had also consumed liquor and was under influence of liquor. V olunteered, Sher Pal Singh had not consumed liquor in said function. After taking lunch, Sher Pal Singh had started for Sunrise Palace to his village Danipur. It is correct that Sunrise marriage palace and village Danipur are situated at Hissar Road which is a state high way. He remembers number of car of Sher Pal on which he had started from Matheri to Danipur. He along with Kanwar Pal had also started from ceremony to village Danipur on a separate car bearing SHEPAL SINGH VS. SATNAM SINGH ETC 8 registration No. HR 01 AJ 6633. It is correct that winter season had started at that time. It is incorrect to suggest that foggy season had started and visibility on the road was not clear and hence Sher Pal could not notice the upcoming traffic on the state Highway. V olunteered, he could clearly see the traffic coming from the opposite side, therefore, he can say that Sherpal Singh could also clearly see the traffic coming from opposite side. He had seen the truck No. HR 69 8567 coming from Hissar side towards village Matheri side. It is incorrect to suggest that no accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of truck No. HR 69 8567. The truck in question had hit the swift car of Sherpal Singh and due to impact car of Sherpal had fallen down on the side of the road. His car was not hit by the said truck. It is incorrect to suggest that truck in question being driven in rash and negligent manner that it would have dragged his car also. V olunteered seeing the accident of vehicle of Sherpal Singh, he had stopped his car 500-700 meters prior. It is incorrect to suggest that it was a head on collusion and that too on the middle of the road. No version regarding head on collusion has been mentioned in FIR lodged by him. By that time police had not visited at the site. He does not know whether any photographs of both vehicles were clicked by th police or not. He had taken Sherpal Singh to Civil Hospital Ambala City from where he was referred to some higher instituted at Chandigarh, therefore, he had taken Sherpal Singh to Fortis Hospital, Mohali. He does not remember whether his name was referred in “brought by” column of SHEPAL SINGH VS. SATNAM SINGH ETC 9 MLR of Sher Pal Singh. It is correct that no MLR was prepared on 26.11.2014. V olunteered Bed Head Ticket was prepared on 26.11.2014, however, on request the MLR was prepared on 28.11.2015. Other relatives had also rushed to civil Hospital Ambala City. 7-8 persons had gone to Fortis Hospital Mohali alongwith him. He does not remember whether any ruqa was sent by Civil Hospital Ambala City or not. Sherpal Singh had suffered fracture on both legs, lower jaw injury besides other injuries. He does not remember how much expenditure on treatment was made by Sherpal Singh, details of same can be obtained from Sherpal Singh. He does not know when the driver was arrested or when the truck in question was taken into police possession. He knew that the driver had ran away from the site after leaving the truck there. It is correct that FIR was lodged after one day and not on 26.11.2014. It is incorrect to suggest that he being brother of claimant had wrongly lodged FIR Ex.P4 by involving the truck in question. It is further incorrect to suggest that accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of Sherpal Singh who could not notice the vehicle coming from opposite side due to foggy season and that too in the middle of the road. PW4 Dr. Ajay Bhambri has brought the summoned record pertaining to patient Sherpal Singh, aged 38 years, UHID No.00509408, date of admission 26.11.2014. As per summoned record, the patient was brought in the emergency department of Fortis Hospital after being referred from Civil Hospital, Ambala with alleged history of RSA SHEPAL SINGH VS. SATNAM SINGH ETC 10 sustaining injuries on the face with fracture of multiple bones of face and mandible with fracture of right forearm and arm bones and fracture of right leg and left leg bonds with multiple fractures of ribs with injury to the arch of aorta with injury to liver. The patient was admitted and managed in the hospital by doctors of various specialties namely Dr. Rajiv Kapoor, Dr. Ravul Jindal, himself, Dr. Ashish Gupta, Dr. K.M. Kapoor and Dr. Ashish Pathak. Patient underwent various surgical procedures as detailed in discharge summary and true attested copy of same is EX.P4/`. He has identified bills EX.P4/2 to EX.P4/35. In cross-examination, he answered that he is Orthopedist surgeon. He was in the team of multiple specialties managing the patient initially. It is correct that treatment provided to the patient was leaving no chance for any surgery relative deformity or disability. It is correct that patient was discharged on 08.12.2014 from their hospital in satisfactory condition. EX.P4/2 is not prepared by him. V olunteered, it is a separate selection and as he knows Vinay Kumar Sharma, who had prepared this bill, therefore, he had identified this bill. Documents EX.P4/2 to EX.P4/35 were not issued by him. It is correct that these are computerized generated. The total amount of bill issued by their hospital was Rs.14,20,392/-. It is correct that proper receipts are issued by their hospital section against this bill. He does not know if any rukka was sent to the police or not. PW5 Ram Lakshman, Chemist Ram Medicos, Rattangarh, SHEPAL SINGH VS. SATNAM SINGH ETC 11 Ambala has brought the summoned record pertaining to medicine bills issued to claimant Ex.PW5/1 to EX.PW5/9. He was cross-examined. PW6 Dr. Raj Kamal Grewal has brought the summoned record pertaining to patient Sherpal bearing Card No.21608 for dental implants to replace fractured teeth due to accident. All the infected teeth which were 10 in number were extracted and replaced by way of dental implants and root canal treatment. The treatment is still continuing. He identified bill dated 10.11.2015 along-with original prescription slips EX.PW6/1 to EX.PW6/6 and as per record, today a sum of Rs.10,000/- is still due from the patient Sherpal. In cross-examination, he answered that the patient approached him for giving his treatment from Fortis Hospital, Mohali and for the treatment, the patient had given him history of road side accident. Infected teeth were fractured one. It is correct that treatment given to the patient was on the lines leaving no chance for any deformity or disability. PW7 Sherpal Singh (claimant) tendered affidavit X.PW7/A along-with documents EX.P1 to EX.P6/6, EX.P7 in is evidence. In cross- examination, he answered that on 26.11.2014, at Mathrei Marriage Palace, there was marriage ceremony of son of Jasbir Singh, r/o village Jalbehra. He is in relation of them. He along-with his other family members had attended the said marriage ceremony. It is correct that Vijay Pal is his real brother. He does not remember whether liquor was being served in the said ceremony or not. It is incorrect to suggest that he had consumed SHEPAL SINGH VS. SATNAM SINGH ETC 12 liquor in the said function and was not in position to drive the vehicle. He remembers the number of his swift car as HR 01 AF 4600. He had moved out from the marriage palace at about 3.00 PM and was crossing the village Naggal within 15 minutes. It is incorrect to suggest that he was driving his car in rash and negligent manner, therefore, only he was able to reach village Naggal within 15 minutes. He had seen the truck Half KM away. It is wrong to suggest that he was trying to overtake a tractor trolley, without caring for the upcoming traffic from the opposite side of said national highway and in a process to overtake tractor trolley in high speed, he noticed some other vehicle coming from opposite direction which was being driven in its correct left side of the road. It is further incorrect to suggest that he being overtaking the tractor trolley in rash and negligent manner, could not control his car all of a sudden, he seeing the vehicle coming from opposite side and himself had hit his car with the truck in question coming from opposite direction and that too in his correct left side of the road and in correct speed. He does not know the above fact regarding overtaking the tractor trolley has been mentioned by the truck in question in his OD claim form. V olunteered, the truck owner might have stated wrong version in said OD claim form. It is incorrect to suggest that no accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of truck No. HR 69 8597. In further cross-examination, he answered that he had become unconscious and was taken to G.H Ambala City by his brother SHEPAL SINGH VS. SATNAM SINGH ETC 13 Vijay Pal. He does not know whether the name of Vijay Pal has been mentioned in column “brought by” of MLR or not. Thereafter, he was shifted to Fortis Hospital, Mohali. He does not know whether any ruqqa was sent by doctors of GH Ambala City. Police had visited the spot and hospital also. It is correct that his statement was not recorded by the police. V olunteered, statement of Vijay Pal was recorded and he was medically unfit to give any statement. He does not know whether any photographs at the site of the accident was taken by the police or not. He does not know when the truck or car was taken into police possession. He does not know that what site plan was prepared by the police. It is incorrect to suggest that as per the site plan prepared by the police the truck is shown to be in his correct left side of the road. He does not know regarding the status of criminal case registered against Satnam Singh. V olunteered said case is pending before the concerned Illaqa Magistrate. It is correct that he had come of his own in this case to depose and that too without any support of any person or any artificial support. It is also correct that he is doing his routine work as he used to do earlier. V olunteered he feels some pain in his legs some times for which he had to take pain killer medicine. He had placed on record all medical prescription, treatment and its bills. He took best of the treatment leaving no chance of any deformity or disability. V olunteered, he had been issued 15 percent disability by the medical board . It is incorrect to suggest that despite taking best treatment disability certificate SHEPAL SINGH VS. SATNAM SINGH ETC 14 Ex.P7 has been wrongly obtained and that too without any factual disability. It is correct that his children are still continuing with their studies. His agricultural work and commission agent shop is continuing and is in running status. He does not have any record qua business loss. He had all bills of treatment which have been placed on record. It is incorrect that exaggerated bills have been got prepared by him. It is incorrect to suggest that treatment taken by him can be provided at a much cheaper rates at Government hospital and PGI. It is incorrect to suggest that he is not entitled for all alleged treatment bills paid by him in five star hospital. PW8 Dr. Vikas Paul, Orthopedic surgeon, deposed that on 1.6.2016 he along with other members of board examined Sherpal son of Mewa Singh R/o VPO Danipur for assessing his disability and it was found that Sher Pal Singh having 15 percent permanent disability on account of right fixation and law. He had seen the original disability certificate and proved the copy of the same as Ex.P7. In cross- examination, he answered that he had never treated the patient prior to issuing Ex.P7. The disability as assessed is relating to particular limb only and will not affect working of other parts of the body. Thereafter, learned counsel for claimant tendered documents Ex.P8 to Ex.P10 and closed the evidence of the claimant. SHEPAL SINGH VS. SATNAM SINGH ETC 15 On the other hand, respondent No.3 examined RW1 Arun Kumar Sharma {Crimnal Ahlmad in the court of Sh. Udhay Partap, JMIC Ambala} who has brought the summoned record pertaining to case titled as State Vs. Satnam Singh bearing FIR No.114 dated 27.11.2014 u/s 279, 337, 338 of IPC, P.S, Naggal and the case was fixed on 28.09.2016 for prosecution evidence. As per record, accused was arrested on 30.11.2014 vide arrest memo Ex.R1. He has proved the recovery memo of truck in question as Ex.R2; recovery memo of DL of accused as Ex.R3 and site plan as Ex.R4. In cross-examination, he answered that the accused in this case was arrested on 30.11.2014 and later released on same day. Vehicle No. HR 69 8597 was released on superdari on 1.12.2014. Challan was filed and charge was framed against accused Satnam Singh u/s 279, 337, 338 of IPC on 22.04.2015. Thereafter, learned counsel for respondents No.1 and 2 tendered documents Ex.R5/A copy of old DL; Ex.R6 attested copy of smart card; Ex.R7 RTI application; Ex.R8 postal order; Ex.R9 postal receipt; Ex.R10 RTI Information; Ex.R11 Postal envelope; Ex.R12 copy of RC, Ex.R13 RC Index; Ex.R14 Road tax; Ex.R15 National Permit; Ex.R16 All India permit; Ex.R17 fitness certificate; Ex.R18 Insurance cover note and closed the evidence on 21.11.2016.

SATNAM SINGH ETC 16 Ex.R30 List of RTOs, Mark R1 to Ex.R3 zimney orders and closed the evidence. In rebuttal evidence, counsel for claimant tendered documents Ex.P11 and Ex.P12 and closed the same. 7I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1: 8Onus to prove this issue is upon claimant. It is argued by counsel for claimant that claimant received injuries in a motor vehicular accident due to rash and negligent driving of Respondent no.1, who is facing trial before the Court of Sh. Udhay Partap, learned JMIC Ambala, as per charge sheet etc. It is further argued that claimant examined himself as PW7 and eye witness PW3 supporting the facts mentioned in the petition and so their statement in the shape of affidavits EX.PW3/A& Ex.PW7/A corroborated with other documentary evidence make it clear that accident in question was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. He urged that this issue be decided against the respondent No.1 and in favour of claimant. 9On the other hand, it is argued by learned counsel for respondent no.1&2 that no accident was taken place with offending vehicle, which was insured with respondent No.3 at the day of relevant time. It is argued by counsel for respondent No.3 that no accident took place with the offending vehicle due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 and if any accident was occurred, even then, respondent SHEPAL SINGH VS. SATNAM SINGH ETC 17 No.1 was not having valid and effective driving licence and so respondent is not liable to pay compensation and prayed for deciding this issue against claimant. 10I have considered rival contentions put forth by learned counsel for respective parties and have perused the entire evidence meticulously. After thorough examination, it is observed that PW7 Sherpal Singh (injured) tendered affidavit Ex.PW7/A reiterating the contents mentioned in the petition. The author of FIR namely Vijay Pal as PW3 has also supported the contents of accident. It is apparent that investigation was carried out on the basis of FIR and final report prepared u/s 173 CRPC was submitted against respondent No.1 who was found involved for committing offence punishable under sections 279, 337 and 338 of IPC. Looking into consideration the statements of PW3 & PW7, corroborated with documentary proof like FIR, Final report, charge sheet etc, it can be safely gathered that there are available sufficient material which would establish the factum of motor vehicular accident due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1. 11It is quite well settled that though lodging of first information report is not an essential prerequisite for claiming compensation arising from a motor accident as Tribunal has to decide the case on the basis of evidence available on file without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. However, it is, indeed, a settled preposition of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil SHEPAL SINGH VS. SATNAM SINGH ETC 18 cases. It must be remembered that in a criminal case, prosecution is required to prove its case beyond shadow of reasonable doubt. However, in a motor accident claim, the claimant is not required to prove the case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. The claimant is required to establish that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts upon the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way alleged by the claimant. Unquestioned, each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The provisions regarding claim under the Act are enacted by keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimants are always entitled for compensation irrespective of fact whether the police has registered the offence regarding the incident or not because no claim case can be left over on the mercy of the police. 12 It is evident that respondent no.1 is facing trial in criminal case. In this way, it can be easily said that claimant received injuries in the motor vehicular accident due to rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1, against whom FIR was lodged and he has also been facing trial. In view of law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993(2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008(2) R.C.R. (civil) 774 , and entire facts and circumstances, this Tribunal is of the considered opinion that there is sufficient evidence on SHEPAL SINGH VS. SATNAM SINGH ETC 19 file to reach the formidable conclusion that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. Accordingly, issued no.1 is decided against respondent no.1 and in favour of claimant. ISSUE NO.2: 13Onus to prove this issue is upon claimant. It is argued by counsel for claimant that condition of injured was not stable after the accident and he remained undergoing medical treatment for a long period. His permanent disability has been assessed to the extent of 15 percent as per disability certificate Ex.P7 and so claimant deserves appropriate compensation according to loss of income, medical bills etc. It is also argued that prior to accident claimant was young married man having two small school going kinds and doing the agricultural work on the land of his share alongwith other land on lease. He is also having partnership in commission agent shop in grain market shop No.15 Ex.New Grain Market, Ambala City under the name and style of Sher Pal Dilbagh Singh. He suffered great loss as most vital part of his body has fractures such as forearm, both legs and right arm, crushed hear nerves was beaten lower jaw due to this accident and he became incapable due to 15 percent permanent disability. 14On the other hand, it is argued by learned counsel for respondent No.3 that claimant was discharged from hospital on 8.12.2014 in satisfactory condition from forties hospital as per statement of PW4. It is further argued that PW2 has admitted that injured is able to walk SHEPAL SINGH VS. SATNAM SINGH ETC 20 properly and so permanent disability to the extent of 15 percent is relating to particular limb and so injured is not entitled to claim compensation according to multiplier, rather, his permanent disability can be assessed from other mode and prayed for deciding this issue against the claimants. 15 Having due regard to the contentions, it is apparent that claimant sustained 15 percent disability with regard to particular limb which would have no effect qua his business etc. He proved disability certificate as Ex.P7. PW4 categorically stated that it is correct that patient was discharged on 08.12.2014 from their hospital in satisfactory condition. PW4 has also identified bills EX.P4/2 to EX.P4/35 total amounting Rs.14,20,392/-{ in round figure 14,20,400/-}. Although, claimant has also produced different bills relating to future treatment from different doctors after long period, but same can not be considered to be part of this claim petition as claimant was discharged from forties Hospital in satisfactory condition. Additionally, claimant must have spent some amount on account of rich diet, attendants, transportation, visitors, follow up treatment etc. In Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences versus Prasanth S.Dhananka, 2010 ACJ 38 (SC) , by the three-Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court, it was observed that sympathy for the victim does not, and should not, come in the way of making a correct assessment, but if a case is made out, the Court must not be chary of awarding adequate compensation. It was further observed that the case of an injured and disabled person is, however, more pitiable SHEPAL SINGH VS. SATNAM SINGH ETC 21 and the feeling of hurt, helplessness, despair and often destitution ensues every day. The support that is needed by a severely handicapped person comes at an enormous price, physical, financial and emotional, not only on the victim but even more so on his family and attendants and the stress saps their energy and destroys their equanimity. In Raj Kumar versus Ajay Kumar, 2011 ACJ-1- (SC); it was observed that a person is not only to be compensated for the physical injury, but also for the loss which he suffered as a result of such injury. This means that he is to be compensated for his inability to lead a full life, his inability to enjoy those normal amenities which he would have enjoyed but for the injuries, and his inability to earn as much as he used to earn or could have earned. 16 It is further made clear that he received 15 per cent disability as per disability certificate Ex.P7 . In view of extent of physical disability and its nature when examined in the light of Judgment in Ram Kiran Goyal vs Sub Divisional engineer, mechanical and other 2008{2} RCR {Civil} 103 , claimant is entitled to Rs.30,000/- @ 2000/- per percent. 17 In the light of overall facts and circumstances arising out in this petition, this Tribunal finds justification in assessing compensation according to injuries attributed to claimant as per settled preposition of law in Raj Kumar Vs Ajay Kumar, (2011)1 SCC 343 , the petitioner- claimant is held entitled to the following compensation: Pecuniary damages (Special damages) SHEPAL SINGH VS. SATNAM SINGH ETC 22 15% permanent disability; Rs. 30,000/- (i).Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and miscellaneous expenditure.Rs.14,20,400/- /-{medicine bills of Forties}plus Rs.10000/- including all expenses. (ii).Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising: (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment; (b) Loss of future earning on account of injuries etc. 10000/- 10000/- (iii). Future medical expenses. 10,000/ - None-pecuniary damages (General damages) (iv). Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries. 10 000/- (v). Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage). nil (vi).Loss of expectation of life ( shortening of normal longevity). nil /- Total Compensation Rs.14,90,400/- 18 The petitioner is also entitled to interest @ 7.5% per annum on the total awarded compensation amount from the date of filing of petition till realization. The computation of compensation is just, equitable, fair and reasonable. Remaining relief sought by petitioner- claimant stands declined. Accordingly, Issue no.2 is decided in the above stated terms, in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.3,4,5 & 7: 19 The onus to prove these issues are upon Respondents, but they neither pressed these issues nor led any evidence. Further it has been SHEPAL SINGH VS. SATNAM SINGH ETC 23 discussed in detail under issue no.1, that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and thus it can not be said that no accident was taken place with offending vehicle or the instant claim petition is not maintainable etc. In this way, it has become obvious for this tribunal that respondents have failed to prove these issues and as such this tribunal has left with no other option except to decide the same against Respondents. Accordingly, these issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.6: 20The onus to prove this issue is upon the respondent No.3, who is under the obligation to prove this fact that the respondent No.1 was not holding valid D/L at the relevant time of accident and as such he has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and so respondent No.3 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimant. However, there is nothing on record to show that respondent no.1 was not having valid D/L at the relevant time, rather valid D/L was issued from Government of Nagaland which was also verified while issuing fresh samrt card D/L as per government Notification. Needless to state that Insurance Policy revealed that offending vehicle, as per RC was insured with the respondent No.3 at the relevant time. In the fact and circumstances, this tribunal has no hitch to say that respondent no.3 can not be exonerated from its liability to indemnify the insured and thus all respondents are jointly, equally and severally liable to pay the awarded SHEPAL SINGH VS. SATNAM SINGH ETC 24 compensation amount to claimant and respondent no.3 shall indemnify the insured. Accordingly, this Issue is decided against the respondent No.3. ISSUE NO8 (RELIEF): PETITION SUCCEED S 21In view of the foregoing discussion, instant claim petition stands allowed with costs in a manner that the claimant-petitioner is entitled to compensation of Rs.14,90,400/ - along with interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition till the date of actual payment. The awarded compensation amount along with interest shall be payable jointly, equally and severally by all Respondents and respondent no.3 shall indemnify the insured. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.3000/-. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly. After due compliance, file be consigned to records.

KA VITA DEVI ETC VS WAZIRU JHAMA ETC 3 -.- Present:- Shri J. P. S. Chauhan, Counsel for the petitioners. Shri R. K.Vig, Counsel for respondent No.3. Respondent No.1 & 2 already ex parte vide order dated 13.10.2016. AWARD:- This award shall dispose of aforesaid two claim petitions titled as Kavita Devi etc Vs. Waziru Jhama etc ( in short to be refer as “First Petition”) and titled as Kanwar Singh Vs. Waziru Jhama etc (in short to be refer as “Second Petition”). Both the claim petitions are being preferred relating to motor vehicular accident on 24.05.2015, which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of Tata Magic bearing Registration No. UP-11T-5147 by respondent No.1 {driver} and at the relevant time, the vehicle in question was owned with respondent No.2 and was insured with the respondent no.3. 2The relevant facts leading to accident in both claim petitions are that on 24.05.2015, Karan Singh alias Labh Singh, {since deceased} was going in his Alto Car bearing Registration No. HR-54-B-5350 in the company of his father-claimant No.4, his wife Kavita Devi-claimant No.1- his daughter Riya- claimant No.2 and his son- Shiv Raj, from his village Thambar for Pipal Shah and accidental car was being driven by its driver on his correct left side of the road in a very carefully, cautiously and in a normal speed by observing the traffic rule. At about 10.00 AM, when they reached near Electricity House, Bye-pass, Ambehta Peer, Nakur, District Saharanpur (U.P), meanwhile, a Tata Magic bearing Registration No. UP-11T-5147 came from opposite side, being driven by KA VITA DEVI ETC VS WAZIRU JHAMA ETC 4 its driver in a most rash and negligent manner, without taking care of by observing the traffic rules, struck against car straightly and due to this impact, all the occupants of the car suffered multiple, grievous and serious injuries and Karan Singh was succumbed to the accidental injuries on the spot. His father noted number of offending vehicle, but, the respondent No.1 by taking undue benefit, fled from the place of accident. Soon after the accident, all occupants were shifted to civil hospital Nakur in ambulance, but the doctor on duty declared the Karan Singh brought as dead and PMR of dead body was conducted and other injured were medically treated there. Other aspects of first claim petition are that age of deceased was 34 years and was posted as police constable in Police Line Kurukshetra and he was drawing salary of Rs. 30,000/- per month. All the claimants being widow {claimant No.1}, minor children {claimants No.2 and 3} and parents {claimants No.4 and 5} were dependent upon the income of the deceased. She {claimant No.1} has become widow when she is hardly 30 years of age and she has suffered consortium, the claimants No.2 and 3 have lost the love and affection of their father and claimants No.4 and 5 have lost their son and they had seen the death of their deceased son before their eyes. Further, study of claimant No.2 has been disturbed and is likely to be discontinued for want of funds due to death of only earning member in this accident. The future of all claimants has gone to darkness and they have been driven on road and their source of income has all of a sudden gone to an end and the claimants No.1 to 4 KA VITA DEVI ETC VS WAZIRU JHAMA ETC 5 also suffered multiple injuries in this accident. The claimants were having hopes which have been scattered like broken glasses due to accidental death. They have spent more than Rs. One lac on transportation, cremation and last rites of the deceased. Other aspects of second claim petition are that soon after the accident, injured was taken to General Hospital, Nakur. On seeing the critical condition, injured was at once referred to Synergy Hospital, Dehradun, where he was admitted for three days. Thereafter, on 27.05.2015 he was got shifted to Kohli Hospital Orthopedic Surgeon, Jagadhri, where he remained admitted from 27.05.2015 to 04.06.2015 as Indoor patient. Pin in his right wrist was inserted, Belt was applied and stitches on his both eyebrow were applied and his operation was conducted. He used to go to the hospital for weekly check up by arranging private taxi at the cost of Rs.1500/- per visit. He spent approximately 2.5 lacs on his medical treatment, special diet, medicines, transportation, attendant and a huge sum is also likely to be spent on follow up treatment and he is still on bed and has not recovered as yet and has become permanent disabled due to fractures suffered in his right arm, right leg and rib etc. He was advised by doctors to take rich diet for some recovery . His age is 65 years and prior to accident, he was hale and healthy person being an agriculturist and he is having agricultural land about 15 acres in joint name and he also used to sell milk and he was earning more than Rs.25,000/ - per month {i.e Rs.20,000/- per month from agricultural and Rs.5000/- per month by selling milk} and his entire family was dependent KA VITA DEVI ETC VS WAZIRU JHAMA ETC 6 upon the injured and after the accident he has been confined to bed being permanent disabled person. He is not in a position to even stand with the help of stick of his own and pick up weight from his right arm. His thumb impression is obtained on the paper being unable to sign due to fracture in his right wrist. He has kept an attendant to assist him to answer the call. He suffered huge financial losses due to this accident and his family have also suffered financial hardship. His son Karan Singh alias Labh Singh has also died in this accident. The accident took place due to sole rash and negligence of driver of Offending Tata Magic bearing Registration No. UP-11T-5147. FIR bearing No. 154 dated 24.05.2015 under section 279, 337, 338,427, 304-A IPC was registered in Police Station, Nakur against the respondent No.1. Since, the vehicle in question was owned by respondent No.2 and was insured with respondent No.3 at the day of accident and as such all respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation, hence, both separate petitions. 3 Notice of both petitions were given to the respondents. However, respondents No.1 and 2 did not appear despite service and so, they were proceeded against ex parte vide order dated 13.10.2016. Further, respondent No. 3 insurance company filed written statement controverting the assertions made in the petition and took some preliminary objections regarding maintainability, cause of action; that the claim petitions are hit by the principles of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence; that the petitions are bad for non joinder of necessary parties and mis joinder of parties; that the person driving the Tata KA VITA DEVI ETC VS WAZIRU JHAMA ETC 7 Magic No. UP-11-T-5147 was not having a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the accident and further was not qualified for obtaining such driving license and has not satisfied the requirements of the Rule 3 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules and therefore, has contravened the breach of the terms and conditions of the insurance policy; that the respondent reserves its right to take all defences and pleas available under section 148, 149 (2), 167,169 and 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and in terms of the insurance policy. On merit, it has been submitted that no record regarding alleged age, occupation and income of the deceased and that of injured has been placed on record. It is denied that deceased and other occupations of the car suffered serious and grievous injuries due to this accident and the deceased died due to the injuries suffered by him in the alleged accident and the injured/claimant remained admitted in any hospital due to the injuries suffered in the alleged accident and spent such huge amount on their medical treatment, transportation etc. However, a false and frivolous FIR was lodged in order to get compensation from the answering respondent. The Tata Magic bearing registration No. UP-11-T-5147 was never involved in any accident, however, it is submitted that insurance policy stands admitted subject to the terms, conditions, exception and limitation thereof and the confirmation of the compliance of section 64 VB of the Insurance Act, 1938. The policy issued in favour of owner of the vehicle is in possession of the insured who may kindly be directed to produce the same before this Tribunal, failing which, the answering respondent shall KA VITA DEVI ETC VS WAZIRU JHAMA ETC 8 produce the same before the court. The FIR was registered by manipulating the wrong facts in order to get huge compensation from the answering respondent. It is submitted that without prejudice and without admitting the accident, if Ld Tribunal comes to conclusion that accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of driver of Tata Magic in question, then, it is also a contributory negligent on account of rash and negligent driving of the deceased himself who was driving his car in a most rash and negligent manner and without observing traffic rules on the road and as such the answering respondent is not liable to be burdened to pay any compensation. The actual cause of alleged accident has been suppressed as such the answering respondent is not liable in any manner. The claim petition has been filed after due consultation just to get compensation from the answering respondent on purely made up basis which is not sustainable in the eyes of law, so the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. The amount claimed as compensation is much more exaggerated and imaginary one. It is denied that the claimant Kanwar Singh suffered serious and grievous injuries due to this accident and he remained admitted in any hospital due to the injuries suffered in the alleged accident. Rests of facts are denied and prayed for dismissal the petitions with special costs. 4Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following consolidated issues are framed vide order dated 15.12.2016:- 1.Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent of the respondent No.1 while driving Tata Magic bearing Number UP-11-T-5147 resulting into causing injuries to Kanwar Singh and death of Karan KA VITA DEVI ETC VS WAZIRU JHAMA ETC 9 Singh alias Labh Singh, as alleged?

He had not received any compensation from any other authority. He was also cross-examined on other questions. PW4 Kavita Devi (widow of deceased) tendered affidavit Ex.PW4/A reiterating the averments made in the petition. In cross- examination, she answered that she is VIII th class pass. She got married KA VITA DEVI ETC VS WAZIRU JHAMA ETC 12 to Karan Singh on 28.02.2008. Her husband was four years elder to her. Her daughter Ria was born after one year and son Shivraj was born after five and half years of their marriage. They had their own house in Village Thamber.

On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent No.3 has tendered documents i.e Ex.R1 Legal notice dated 21.11.2016; Ex.R2 postal receipt; Ex.R3 Legal notice dated 21.11.2016; Ex.R4 postal receipt; Ex.R5 notice dated 15.12.2016; Ex.R6 postal receipt; Ex.R7 notice dated 15.12.2016; Ex.R8 postal receipt; Ex.R9 attested copy of Insurance Policy and close its evidence. 6I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone KA VITA DEVI ETC VS WAZIRU JHAMA ETC 15 through the case file very carefully. My findings on issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1 : 7 Under this issue, petitioners- claimants are required to prove the fact that motor vehicular accident was occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Tata Magic bearing registration number UP-11-T- 5147 by Respondent no.1, resulting death of Karan Singh @ Labh Singh and causing injuries to second claimant Kanwar Singh and as such they are entitled to appropriate compensation from respondents. 8It is argued by learned counsel for the petitioners-claimants that four persons were travelling in the accidental car and they all sustained injuries, but Karan Singh @ Labh Singh was succumbed to his injuries and second claimant Kanwar Singh sustained multiple injuries. It is further argued that factum of accident is well proved and age of deceased was 34 years and so multiplier of 16 will be applied. Further, second claimant aged 65 years received 15 percent permanent disability and prayed for allowing both claim petitions. 9On the other hand, it is vehemently argued by learned counsel for respondents No.3 that no accident took place with the offending vehicle and false and frivolous FIR has been lodged. It is further argued that respondent No.1 was not holding D/L while plying the vehicle at the relevant date and so if any, compensation is awarded, then respondent No.3 is not liable to indemnify the claimants as per insurance policy and prayed for dismissal of both claim petitions. 10 I have given due regard to the rival contentions put forth by KA VITA DEVI ETC VS WAZIRU JHAMA ETC 16 learned counsel for respective parties and have perused the entire oral evidence coupled with documentary evidence carefully. After thorough examination, it is observed that the petitioners-claimants have come to this Tribunal with categorical stand that the accident was taken place due to rash and negligent driving Tata Magic bearing registration number UP- 11-T-5147 by Respondent No.1, resulting into death of Karan Singh alias Labh Singh and injuries attributed to Shri Kanwar Singh. In order to prove factum of accident, PW1 & PW3 categorically stated through affidavit Ex.PW1/A and EX.PW3/A proving factum of motor vehicular accident, which was occurred due to sole rash and negligent act of the respondent No.1 while driving offending vehicle in question resulting death of Karan Singh alias Labh Singh and injuries attributed to Kanwar Singh. Although, they were cross examined at length, but nothing fruitful can be extracted which may disbelieve factum of motor vehicular accident and thus statement of eye witness PW1 and injured PW3 can not be discarded from any angle relating to death of young person and injuries attributed to PW3 in the aforesaid motor vehicular accident, especially in the circumstances, when their statements are corroborated with documentary evidence like Copy of FIR; Copy of MLR; copy of PMR and copy of final report prepared u/s 173 CRPC etc. It may not be out of place to mention here that despite availing opportunities, respondent no.1 neither appeared nor examined in evidence to rebut the versions of PW1 & PW3. Mere denial of rash and negligent act by respondents 'after causing accident resulting death of young person aged 34 years and KA VITA DEVI ETC VS WAZIRU JHAMA ETC 17 causing injuries to old age person of 65 years, are not found sufficient at all, rather, if there was no rash and negligent act of driver, then respondent no.1 could easily appear in the witness box to rebut the stand taken by claimants-petitioners. However, no reason has been assigned for non- examination of offending vehicle's driver before this Tribunal. In accident cases, it may collect the first hand report from the driver. It may also be said that the driver do not always speak the truth, but the driver's version is the one, which is to be given to the best consideration, because he knows reality as to what actually happened and if the driver of offending vehicle has not been examined, then an adverse inference must be drawn against respondents. 11It is quite well settled that the lodging of the first information report is not an essential prerequisite for claiming compensation arising from a motor accident. Each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The Tribunal is expected to adjudge a case on the basis of the evidence produced without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled position of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. It must be remembered that in a motor accident claim, the claimants are not required to prove their case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. It is trite law that claimants-petitioners are required to prove its case, which sets up the particular case relating to the accident which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts upon the respondents to show that the accident did not KA VITA DEVI ETC VS WAZIRU JHAMA ETC 18 happen in the way as alleged by the claimants. The provisions with regard to claim under the Act are enacted keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimants are always entitled for compensation irrespective whether the police has registered the offence regarding the incident or not because no claim case can be left over on the mercy of the police. 12 The evidence brought on record irrefutably leads to the inference in terms of unrebutted evidence at the instance of petitioners that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1, resulting death of police employee and injuries attributed to deceased father namely Kanwar Singh. Since the respondent No.1 has been facing trial u/ss 279, 337, 304 A and 427 of IPC, therefore, in view of the law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993 (2) P .L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008 (2) R.C.R. (Civil) 774 , it can be safely held that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1. Accordingly, this issue no.1 is decided in favour of the claimants. ISSUE NO. 2: 13 Onus to prove this issue is upon claimants. Here, PW1,PW3 & PW4 have categorically stated that about death of Karan Singh on account of injuries suffered in a motor vehicular accident. Further deceased was government employee being posted as constable in police KA VITA DEVI ETC VS WAZIRU JHAMA ETC 19 department. It is not disputed that age of deceased was 34 years at the relevant time of accident. He was died leaving behind four dependent legal heirs including widow, minor children and mother because father is excluded from dependency. He was to retire from services on 31.3.2039. He was getting monthly salary of Rs.27228/- certificate EX.P4. The claimant no.1 has suffered loss of consortium and all claimants have also deprived from love & affection, pain & agony etc. It may not be out of place to mention here that the monetary compensation will never be a sufficient succor for victims of accidental cases, rather their needs can only be prevented by providing just compensation. The best manner in which victims can be compensated for sufferings only to prevent recurrence of any such road incident. In failure to protect or prevent the sufferings of victims due to death of their bread earner in road accident, it also imposes liability of state to take extra ordinary precaution to reduce such type of road accident by deputing sufficient trained traffic police for compliance of strict traffic rules to avoid such incident. It will certainly take lot of time for rehabilitation by the family members of deceased. In Smt. Sarla Verma and Ors. Vs Delhi Transport Corporation and another AIR 2009 Supreme Court 3104 , it has been held that where the deceased was married and having four to six dependents, the deduction towards personal and living expenses of the deceased, should be one-fourth (1/4th). Here, number of dependent family members i.e widow, two minor children and mother are four and thus, deduction KA VITA DEVI ETC VS WAZIRU JHAMA ETC 20 towards personal and living expenses of the deceased should be 1/4th. Further, 50% future prospects according to age of deceased between 30- 35 from monthly income shall be counted being a government employee . In this way, by applying multiplier of 16, assessment of compensation would come to {30687x12= 368244 x 16=} Rs. 58,91904/--. In view of case law titled as Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd vs Shashi Sharma and others 2016 ACJ 2727{SC} it has been held that amount received or receivable towards the financial assistance equivalent to the pay and allowances for the period specified under rule 5{1} of Haryana Compassionate Assistance to the dependents of deceased Government Employees Rules, 2006, has to be deducted otherwise it would amount to double payment. It is undisputed that claimant no.1 has been getting monthly amount of Rs. 20,497/- w.e.f 25.05.2015 which shall be payable up to 24.05.2030 by Haryana Government and if this period of salary is counted, then it comes to Rs. 20497X 181=3709957/- and after adjusting the same out of total amount of Rs.5891904/-, it comes to Rs. 2181947/- respectively. Additionally, petitioners no.1 to 3 & 5 being legal heirs have deprived from love and affection and also suffered pain, agony due to untimely death, therefore, they are entitled to Rs.50,000/- in that head. They have also spent amount on last rites/funeral of deceased and so they are entitled to funeral expenses amounting Rs.25,000/-. Further, claimant no.1 being widow has suffered loss of consortium in young age, so she is entitled to Rs One lakh in this head. In the manner, a total compensation is computed to Rs.23,56,947/- which shall be payable KA VITA DEVI ETC VS WAZIRU JHAMA ETC 21 along with interest @ 7.5/- per annum from the date of filing the petition till its realization to the petitioners no.1 to 3 & 5 by all respondents. Rests of relief sought by petitioners-claimants stands declined. In this way, first claimants no.1 to 3 & 5 are held entitled to Rs. 23,56,947/- along with interest @ 7.5/- per annum from the date of filing the petition till its realization in equal share except amount of consortium, which shall be paid to claimant no.1 only and rest of amount shall be divided in equal share among them. Accordingly, issue no.2 is decided in favour of claimants-petitioners. 14 So far as second claim petition is concerned; it is evident that claimant received injuries in the accident . He sustained 15 percent permanent disability. Further claimant has produced medicine bills total amounting Rs. 1,15,841/- {in round figure1,16,000/-}. He remained hospitalized for eleven days and so Rs.1000/- per day expenses are taken into consideration on account of diet, transportation etc. In view of extent of physical disability and its nature when examined in the light of Judgment in Ram Kiran Goyal vs Sub Divisional engineer, mechanical and other 2008{2} RCR {Civil} 103 , claimant is entitled to Rs.30,000/- @ 2000/- per percent. According to version of petitioner coupled with medical evidence and i n the light of the law settled in Raj Kumar Vs Ajay Kumar, (2011)1 SCC 343 , second claimant is held entitled to the following compensation: Pecuniary damages (Special damages) 15% permanent disability; Rs. 30,000/- KA VITA DEVI ETC VS WAZIRU JHAMA ETC 22 (i).Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization in PGI, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and miscellaneous expenditure.RS.116000/-medical expenses plus 11000/- as indoor patient including other expenses. (ii).Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising: (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment; (b) Loss of future earning on account of injuries etc. nil nil (iii). Future medical expenses. 10000/- Non-pecuniary damages (General damages) (iv). Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries. RS. 10 000/- (v). Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage). nil (vi).Loss of expectation of life ( shortening of normal longevity). Nil. Total Compensation Rs.,177,000/- 15 In this way, second-claimant is held entitled to comenstaion of Rs.1,77,000/- along with interest @ 7.5% per annumfrom the date of filing of petition till realization of awarded amount. The assessed amount of compensation in both petition are quite fair, just and reasonable. Rests of relief sought by petitioner-claimant stands declined. Accordingly, In view of above discussions, Issue no.2 is decided in the above stated terms, in favour of the petitioners and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.3 to 6 & 8: 16 The onus to prove these issues are upon Respondents but they neither pressed these issues nor led any evidence. However, it has KA VITA DEVI ETC VS WAZIRU JHAMA ETC 23 already discussed in detail under Issue No.1 & 2 that accident was occurred due to rash ad negligent driving of respondent no.1. In this way, it has become obvious on file that this tribunal has left with no other option except to decide these issues against Respondents. Accordingly, these issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.7: 17 Coming to question of liability, where under, onus to prove this issue is upon the respondent No.3, who is under the obligation to prove this fact that the respondent No.1 was not holding valid driving licence to drive offending vehicle at the day of accident and as such respondent n.2 being owner has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. However, respondent No.1&2 neither appeared nor produced D/L and RC before this Tribunal. However, claimants' counsel has produced RC after collecting from state case file in rebuttal evidence. It is, however, undisputed that offending vehicle as per RC was fit to ply on public road. Further, Insurance Policy Ex.R9 would reveal that accidental vehicle, as per RC, was insured with the respondent No.3 at the relevant time. However, Driving licence could not be brought on record by respondent no.1&2 to rebut the plea of respondent no.3 and so, it shall presume that respondent no.1 was not holding valid D/L in compliance the terms and conditions of the insurance policy EX.R9 at the relevant time. Due to non production of D/L, it would draw adverse inference qua respondent no.1 & 2, because, respondent no.3 could not verify the genuineness of D/L and so, it can be safely said that respondent no.2 being owner has KA VITA DEVI ETC VS WAZIRU JHAMA ETC 24 breached the terms and condition of insurance policy due to non production of D/L before this tribunal. Looking into entire facts and circumstance, this Tribunal has no hesitation to say that all respondents all jointly and severally liable to pay amount of compensation to all claimants in both petition, however, at the first instance, respondent no.3 shall indemnify the insured by making payment to claimants and then shall have right to recover 50 percent amount from respondent 1&2 on account of non production of D/L respectively. Accordingly, this Issue in the above terms is decided in favour of the respondent No.3. ISSUE NO.9 (RELIEF): petitions succeed ; 18 In view of the foregoing discussion, all both petition are allowed with cost. In first claim petition, claimants-petitioners no.1 to 3 & 5 of first petition are entitled to compensation of Rs.23,56,947/- along with interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing the claim petition till the date of actual payment. However, amount of compensation to the extent of 1/4th share of claimant no.1 & 5 shall be deposited in the shape of FDR in any nationalized bank for two years and thereafter, same shall be disbursed to them. Further, 1/4th each share of minor children {claimant no.2 & 3} shall be deposited in the shape of FDR and shall be disbursed to them at the time of attaining their majority. However, additional amount of Rs. 1,75,000/-{ consortium etc} shall be deposited in the bank account of claimant no.1 respectively. In S econd claim petition , claimant -petitioner is entitled to compensation of Rs.1,77,000/- along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per KA VITA DEVI ETC VS WAZIRU JHAMA ETC 25 annum from the date of filing the claim petition till the date of actual payment. It is, however, made clear that entire awarded compensation amount along with the interest shall be payable by respondents and respondent no.3 insurance company shall indemnify the insured at the first instance and then shall have right to recover the amount from respondent 1&2 respectively. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.3000/-in each petition. A copy of this award be placed on second claim petition file for record.

Respondents Petitions under Sections 166 of Motor Vehicles Act Present: Shri Lakhwinder Singh Advocate for petitioners Shri Jaswinder Singh Advocate for respondent no.1 Shri Mohinder Bindal Advocate for respondent no.2 A W A R D Vide this common Award, this Tribunal is deposing of above- mentioned three connected claim petitions arising out of the same accident filed by the petitioners under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. 2.Firstly, the facts are taken from MACP No.324 of 2015 titled as Harpreet Singh versus Satpal Singh and another , which has been filed by Harpreet Singh seeking compensation on account of damage caused to his motorcycle bearing registration no.HR54A/6181 in vehicular accident. In this claim petition, while providing necessary particulars as required under the Motor Vehicles Act and the Rules thereunder, petitioner inter- HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 4 alia averred that on 21.6.2015, he was going from Barara to Guru Nanak College, Mullana for leaving his mother Paramjeet Kaur, while driving motorcycle no.HR54A/6181 at moderate speed on left side of the road by observing traffic rules. He averred that around 6.30 PM, when they reached village Sohana near Central Bank, meanwhile, Car no.HR54/8524 came from the side of Mullana i.e. opposite side, being driven by respondent no.1 at very high speed, rashly and negligently in zig-zag manner. He averred that on seeing the Car, he lowered down the speed of his motorcycle and came on extreme left side of the road, but even then the Car by coming on wrong side, struck against his motorcycle, resultantly, he and his mother entangled with the Car, which dragged them for around 10/15 paces. He further averred that they both received multiple, serious and grievous injuries on various parts. He further averred that his motorcycle also got badly damaged. He averred that after accident, respondent no.1 fled away with the Car. He further averred that from the spot, he and his mother were immediately shifted to MM Hospital, Mullana.

It is prayed that an award of Rs.50,000/- alongwith interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of accident till realization be passed in favour of petitioner. 3.In MACP No.325 of 2015 titled as Paramjeet Kaur versus Satpal Singh and another , compensation has been claimed on account of injuries sustained by petitioner Paramjeet Kaur. Other than necessary particulars about the accident, it has been specifically averred in the petition that petitioner suffered multiple, serious and grievous injuries on various parts including spinal cord, neck, head, left arm, thumb etc. and also suffered fractures and she got treatment from Doctors at MM Hospital Mullana as well as other Doctors. She further averred in hospital at Mullana, she was operated upon and she remained admitted for many days and after being discharged, she got treatment as an outdoor patient. She averred that more than Rs.One lakh was spent on her treatment, transportation, medical expenses, attendant and special diet etc. She further averred that prior to accident, she was having good health and physique, but after the accident, she has become disabled. She averred that she was doing job, thereby getting Rs.10,000/- per month. She averred that due to injuries received in accident, she could not attend her job for around three months and remained on leave and an attendant continuously remained with her and thus, she suffered physically, mentally as well as financially on account of injuries suffered HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 6 in the accident. In this claim petition, compensation to the tune of Rs.5 lakh alongwith interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of accident till realization is claimed. 4.In MACP No.326 of 2015 titled as Harpreet Singh versus Satpal Singh and another , compensation has been claimed on account of injuries sustained by petitioner Harpreet Singh. Other than necessary particulars about the accident, it has been specifically averred in the petition that petitioner suffered multiple, serious and grievous injuries on various parts including forehead, left eye, left thigh, right elbow and stomach etc. and also suffered fractures and he got treatment from Doctors at MM Hospital Mullana as well as other Doctors.

He averred that due to injuries received in accident, he could not do his work for around three months and an attendant continuously remained with him and thus, he suffered physically, mentally as well as financially on account of injuries suffered in the accident. HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 7 In this claim petition, compensation to the tune of Rs.5 lakh alongwith interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of accident till realization is claimed. 5.On notice, respondent no.1 appeared and filed written statement in main claim petition titled as Harpreet Singh versus Satpal Singh and another , by taking preliminary objections qua maintainability and suppression. It is averred that no accident, as alleged, had taken place with Car in question and a false FIR has been registered against answering respondent in collusion with police. It is further averred that there is delay of one day in lodging of FIR, which has not been properly explained. On merits, it is submitted that since no alleged accident had occurred, damage to motorcycle in question does not arise. Denying all other averments, dismissal of petition was prayed for. 6.On notice, respondent no.2 also appeared and filed written statement by taking preliminary objections regarding the petition being misconceived, vexatious, untenable and devoid of merit, collusion, respondent no.1 not having valid and effective driving licence, RC and fitness at the time of alleged accident and locus standi, were taken. On merits, accident in question is denied and it is submitted that if accident in question is presumed to have taken place, then claimant suffered alleged loss of motorcycle due to his own negligent driving at fast speed. Denying all other averments, dismissal of the petition was prayed for. 7.In other connected petitions, separate written statements have HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 8 been filed. The stand of the respondents in these claim petitions is same regarding the accident and liability as taken by them in claim petition no.324 of 2015 titled as Harpreet Singh versus Satpal Singh and another . 8.All above mentioned three claim petitions were consolidated vide Order dated 13.5.2016 and from pleadings of parties, following issues were framed: 1.Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 while driving Car bearing registration no.HR54/8524 resulting into damage to motorcycle bearing no.HR54A/6181, injuries to Paramjeet Kaur and Harpreet Singh, as alleged? OPP 2.If issue no.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom, claimants are entitled? OPP 3.Whether respondent no.1 was driving the offending Car in violation of terms and conditions of Insurance Policy? OPR (2) 4.Relief 9.In order to prove their case, petitioner Paramjeet Kaur herself stepped as PW1, whereas claimant Harpreet Singh stepped as PW2. In documentary evidence, documents Ex.P1 to Ex.P58 were tendered. 10.On the other hand, only documents Ex.R1 to Ex.R3 were tendered on behalf of respondent no.1, whereas respondent no.2 led no oral or documentary evidence. 11.No rebuttal evidence was led. HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 9 12.I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the material pleadings, evidence and the legal proposition applicable to the present case. My findings on the above issues are as under:- Issue No.1: 13.To prove this issue, learned counsel for the petitioners took me to the testimony of PW1 Paramjeet Kaur and PW2 Harpreet Singh and contended that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving Car no.HR54/8524 in rash and negligent manner. 14.PW2 Harpreet Singh filed his affidavit Ex.PW2/A and specifically deposed that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 as he was driving Car no.HR54/8524 in rash and negligent manner at that time. He specifically deposed about the manner of accident and the rash and negligent driving on part of respondent no.1. PW1 Paramjeet Kaur corroborated the version of PW2 on the point of rash and negligent driving by respondent no.1 and the manner in which the accident was caused. PW1 and PW2 were cross examined at length, but there is nothing on record on the basis of which their statements can be disbelieved. 15.In regard to the accident, FIR no.131 dated 22.6.2015, P.S. Mullana, District Ambala (Ex.P48) was registered on the statement of PW2 Harpreet Singh. After investigation of case, final report under Section 173 Cr.P.C Ex.P57 was filed and respondent no.1 is facing trial. The respondent no.1 was the best witness, but for reasons best known to him, he failed to appear as witness to controvert the allegations levelled HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 10 against him that he was driving the offending vehicle bearing registration no.HR54/8524 in rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. In a situation, when respondent no.1-driver is facing criminal trial for having caused accident, it is safe to presume that it was due to his negligence that the accident had occurred. 16.Considering the above facts, this tribunal is of the view that the petitioners have successfully proved that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving offending vehicle bearing registration no.HR54/8524 in rash and negligent manner. Hence, this issue is decided in favour of petitioners. Issue no.2 & 3: MACP No.324 of 2015 Harpreet Singh vs. Satpal Singh & another 17.This claim petition has been filed by petitioner claiming compensation of Rs.50,000/- on account of damage to his vehicle i.e. motor-cycle bearing registration no.HR54A/6181. Claimant appeared as PW2 and specifically deposed in his affidavit Ex.PW2/A that his motor- cycle bearing registration no.HR54A/6181, Make Splendor, Model 2012 was badly damaged. In his affidavit, he has not deposed about the amount spent on repair of his motor-cycle. In his cross-examination, he deposed that period of insurance policy of his motor-cycle expired about twenty days prior to this accident and his motor-cycle was not insured. He further deposed that he did not know if repair work of the engine was also done or not or whether engine HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 11 of his motor-cycle was damaged or not. 18.In order to support his claim, petitioner placed on record repair bills of motor-cycle Ex.P49 to Ex.P51, which shows that he spent Rs.29,186/-. As per Insurance Policy of motor-cycle Ex.R1, total value of the motor-cycle has been assessed as Rs.26,700/- for the purpose of calculating the premium. Even if it is taken that motor-cycle was totally damaged, even then he would have claimed Rs.26,700/-. On perusal of bills Ex.P49 to Ex.P51, it is clear that he had got changed some parts of the motor-cycle, which would not been damaged in the accident. It shows that he got changed all parts, which were not in working condition, presuming that Insurance Company will pay against the same. The claimant has not examined any Mechanical Expert or any person from Rekhi Motors, otherwise all things would have been cleared during cross- examination. Nothing is mentioned in bills Ex.P49 to Ex.P51 qua disposal of changed damaged parts of the vehicle nor value of such parts has not been deducted. He has simply placed on record the bills Ex.P49 to Ex.P51. 19.Considering the facts and insured value of the vehicle, this Tribunal is of the view that petitioner is not entitled to get whole of the amount shown in the bills Ex.P49 to Ex.P51. This Tribunal is of the view that petitioner is only entitled to Rs.20,000/- for damage of the vehicle. Accordingly, Rs.20,000/- is awarded to petitioner under the head of damage to vehicle. HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 12 MACP No. 325 of 2015 Paramjeet Kaur vs. Satpal Singh & another 20.The petitioner sustained injuries in the accident in question and she claimed compensation of Rs.5 lakh on account of injuries sustained by her and amount spent by her on her treatment etc. The petitioner appeared as PW1 and deposed that after the accident, she was shifted to MM Hospital, Mullana, where she remained hospitalized for around fifteen days, during which she was operated upon. She deposed that she spent more than Rs.One lakh on her treatment, transportation, medicines, special diet and attendant etc. She further deposed that she was working as Warden in GNI, Mullana and was earning Rs.10,000/- per month. In her cross-examination, she deposed that she had not brought any document to prove her employment or about any loss of income. 21.In order to support her version regarding amount spent by her on treatment, she placed on record her medical bills Ex.P1 to Ex.P29 and Admission Form Ex.P31. On perusal of Admission Form, it is clear that she remained admitted for twelve days (21.6.2015 to 2.7.2015) in MM Institute of Medical Science, Mullana. Considering the fact that petitioner remained hospitalized for twelve days and suffered pain and suffering, this Tribunal is of the view that petitioner is entitled to Rs.12,000/- under the head of pain and suffering. Accordingly, Rs.12,000/- is awarded to petitioner under the head of pain and suffering. HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 13 22.On perusal of medical bills Ex.P1 to Ex.P29, it is clear that petitioner spent Rs.11,597/- on her treatment. Accordingly, Rs.11,600/- is awarded to petitioner under the head of medical bills and treatment charges. 23.Compensation has also been claimed under the head permanent disability. As per Disability Certificate Ex.P30, disability of 5% has been assessed due to mild back ache. It is also clear that the disability is provisional and not permanent. Accordingly, it is held that petitioner is not entitled to any compensation under the head of permanent disability. 24.Now coming to loss of income. Petitioner remained hospitalized and under treatment. As per Certificate Ex.P52, issued by Guru Nanak Institute of Technology, petitioner was working as Care Taker in Girls' Hostel and was drawing salary of Rs.8000/- per month. She remained on leave for one month and the leave for said period was without pay. So, she is entitled to get Rs.8000/- under the head of loss of income and accordingly, Rs.8000/- is awarded to claimant under the head of loss of income. 25.In addition to the amount awarded above, Rs.3000/- is awarded under the head of special diet and Rs.2000/- under the head of transportation. In total, Rs.36,600/- is awarded in favour of the petitioner on account of the injuries suffered by the petitioner in the accident. HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 14 MACP No. 326 of 2015 Harpreet Singh vs. Satpal Singh & another 26.The petitioner sustained injuries in the accident in question and he claimed compensation of Rs.5 lakh on account of injuries sustained by him and amount spent by him on his treatment etc. The petitioner appeared as PW2 and deposed that after the accident, he was shifted to MM Hospital, Mullana, where he remained hospitalized for around ten days, during which he was operated upon. He deposed that he spent more than Rs.One lakh on his treatment, transportation, medicines, special diet and attendant etc. He further deposed that he was getting training in T.B. Hospital, Ambala and was earning Rs.10,000/- per month. 27.In order to support his version regarding amount spent by him on treatment, he placed on record his medical bills Ex.P32 to Ex.P46 and Admission Form Ex.P47. On perusal of Admission Form, it is clear that he remained admitted for five days (21.6.2015 to 25.6.2015) in MM Institute of Medical Science, Mullana. Considering the fact that petitioner remained hospitalized for five days and suffered pain and suffering, this Tribunal is of the view that petitioner is entitled to Rs.5000/- under the head of pain and suffering. Accordingly, Rs.5000/- is awarded to petitioner under the head of pain and suffering. 28.On perusal of medical bills Ex.P32 to Ex.P46, it is clear that petitioner spent Rs.9500/- on his treatment. Accordingly, Rs.8478/- is awarded to petitioner under the head of medical bills and treatment charges. HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 15 29.Compensation has also been claimed under the head permanent disability. He has not placed on record any document in support of any disability. So, he is not entitled to any compensation under the head of permanent disability. 30.In addition to the amount awarded above, Rs.3000/- is awarded under the head of special diet, Rs.5000/- is awarded under the head of loss of income and Rs.2000/- under the head of transportation. In total, Rs.23,478/- is awarded in favour of petitioner on account of injuries suffered by petitioner in the accident. 31.Now coming to the question of liability to pay compensation. No evidence has been led by Insurance Company to prove issue no.3. Accordingly, issue no.3 is decided against respondent no.2. Admittedly, vehicle in question was insured with respondent no.2. Accordingly, respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to petitioners.

Other than necessary particulars about the accident, it has been specifically averred in the petition that petitioner suffered multiple, serious and grievous injuries on various parts including spinal cord, neck, head, left arm, thumb etc. and also suffered fractures and she got treatment from Doctors at MM Hospital Mullana as well as other Doctors.

HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 7 In this claim petition, compensation to the tune of Rs.5 lakh alongwith interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of accident till realization is claimed. 5.On notice, respondent no.1 appeared and filed written statement in main claim petition titled as Harpreet Singh versus Satpal Singh and another , by taking preliminary objections qua maintainability and suppression. It is averred that no accident, as alleged, had taken place with Car in question and a false FIR has been registered against answering respondent in collusion with police. It is further averred that there is delay of one day in lodging of FIR, which has not been properly explained. On merits, it is submitted that since no alleged accident had occurred, damage to motorcycle in question does not arise. Denying all other averments, dismissal of petition was prayed for. 6.On notice, respondent no.2 also appeared and filed written statement by taking preliminary objections regarding the petition being misconceived, vexatious, untenable and devoid of merit, collusion, respondent no.1 not having valid and effective driving licence, RC and fitness at the time of alleged accident and locus standi, were taken. On merits, accident in question is denied and it is submitted that if accident in question is presumed to have taken place, then claimant suffered alleged loss of motorcycle due to his own negligent driving at fast speed. Denying all other averments, dismissal of the petition was prayed for. 7.In other connected petitions, separate written statements have HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 8 been filed. The stand of the respondents in these claim petitions is same regarding the accident and liability as taken by them in claim petition no.324 of 2015 titled as Harpreet Singh versus Satpal Singh and another . 8.All above mentioned three claim petitions were consolidated vide Order dated 13.5.2016 and from pleadings of parties, following issues were framed: 1.Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 while driving Car bearing registration no.HR54/8524 resulting into damage to motorcycle bearing no.HR54A/6181, injuries to Paramjeet Kaur and Harpreet Singh, as alleged? OPP 2.If issue no.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom, claimants are entitled? OPP 3.Whether respondent no.1 was driving the offending Car in violation of terms and conditions of Insurance Policy? OPR (2) 4.Relief 9.In order to prove their case, petitioner Paramjeet Kaur herself stepped as PW1, whereas claimant Harpreet Singh stepped as PW2. In documentary evidence, documents Ex.P1 to Ex.P58 were tendered. 10.On the other hand, only documents Ex.R1 to Ex.R3 were tendered on behalf of respondent no.1, whereas respondent no.2 led no oral or documentary evidence. 11.No rebuttal evidence was led. HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 9 12.I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the material pleadings, evidence and the legal proposition applicable to the present case. My findings on the above issues are as under:- Issue No.1: 13.To prove this issue, learned counsel for the petitioners took me to the testimony of PW1 Paramjeet Kaur and PW2 Harpreet Singh and contended that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving Car no.HR54/8524 in rash and negligent manner. 14.PW2 Harpreet Singh filed his affidavit Ex.PW2/A and specifically deposed that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 as he was driving Car no.HR54/8524 in rash and negligent manner at that time. He specifically deposed about the manner of accident and the rash and negligent driving on part of respondent no.1. PW1 Paramjeet Kaur corroborated the version of PW2 on the point of rash and negligent driving by respondent no.1 and the manner in which the accident was caused. PW1 and PW2 were cross examined at length, but there is nothing on record on the basis of which their statements can be disbelieved. 15.In regard to the accident, FIR no.131 dated 22.6.2015, P.S. Mullana, District Ambala (Ex.P48) was registered on the statement of PW2 Harpreet Singh. After investigation of case, final report under Section 173 Cr.P.C Ex.P57 was filed and respondent no.1 is facing trial. The respondent no.1 was the best witness, but for reasons best known to him, he failed to appear as witness to controvert the allegations levelled HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 10 against him that he was driving the offending vehicle bearing registration no.HR54/8524 in rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. In a situation, when respondent no.1-driver is facing criminal trial for having caused accident, it is safe to presume that it was due to his negligence that the accident had occurred. 16.Considering the above facts, this tribunal is of the view that the petitioners have successfully proved that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving offending vehicle bearing registration no.HR54/8524 in rash and negligent manner. Hence, this issue is decided in favour of petitioners. Issue no.2 & 3: MACP No.324 of 2015 Harpreet Singh vs. Satpal Singh & another 17.This claim petition has been filed by petitioner claiming compensation of Rs.50,000/- on account of damage to his vehicle i.e. motor-cycle bearing registration no.HR54A/6181. Claimant appeared as PW2 and specifically deposed in his affidavit Ex.PW2/A that his motor- cycle bearing registration no.HR54A/6181, Make Splendor, Model 2012 was badly damaged. In his affidavit, he has not deposed about the amount spent on repair of his motor-cycle. In his cross-examination, he deposed that period of insurance policy of his motor-cycle expired about twenty days prior to this accident and his motor-cycle was not insured. He further deposed that he did not know if repair work of the engine was also done or not or whether engine HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 11 of his motor-cycle was damaged or not. 18.In order to support his claim, petitioner placed on record repair bills of motor-cycle Ex.P49 to Ex.P51, which shows that he spent Rs.29,186/-. As per Insurance Policy of motor-cycle Ex.R1, total value of the motor-cycle has been assessed as Rs.26,700/- for the purpose of calculating the premium. Even if it is taken that motor-cycle was totally damaged, even then he would have claimed Rs.26,700/-. On perusal of bills Ex.P49 to Ex.P51, it is clear that he had got changed some parts of the motor-cycle, which would not been damaged in the accident. It shows that he got changed all parts, which were not in working condition, presuming that Insurance Company will pay against the same. The claimant has not examined any Mechanical Expert or any person from Rekhi Motors, otherwise all things would have been cleared during cross- examination. Nothing is mentioned in bills Ex.P49 to Ex.P51 qua disposal of changed damaged parts of the vehicle nor value of such parts has not been deducted. He has simply placed on record the bills Ex.P49 to Ex.P51. 19.Considering the facts and insured value of the vehicle, this Tribunal is of the view that petitioner is not entitled to get whole of the amount shown in the bills Ex.P49 to Ex.P51. This Tribunal is of the view that petitioner is only entitled to Rs.20,000/- for damage of the vehicle. Accordingly, Rs.20,000/- is awarded to petitioner under the head of damage to vehicle. HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 12 MACP No. 325 of 2015 Paramjeet Kaur vs. Satpal Singh & another 20.The petitioner sustained injuries in the accident in question and she claimed compensation of Rs.5 lakh on account of injuries sustained by her and amount spent by her on her treatment etc. The petitioner appeared as PW1 and deposed that after the accident, she was shifted to MM Hospital, Mullana, where she remained hospitalized for around fifteen days, during which she was operated upon.

In her cross-examination, she deposed that she had not brought any document to prove her employment or about any loss of income. 21.In order to support her version regarding amount spent by her on treatment, she placed on record her medical bills Ex.P1 to Ex.P29 and Admission Form Ex.P31. On perusal of Admission Form, it is clear that she remained admitted for twelve days (21.6.2015 to 2.7.2015) in MM Institute of Medical Science, Mullana. Considering the fact that petitioner remained hospitalized for twelve days and suffered pain and suffering, this Tribunal is of the view that petitioner is entitled to Rs.12,000/- under the head of pain and suffering. Accordingly, Rs.12,000/- is awarded to petitioner under the head of pain and suffering. HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 13 22.On perusal of medical bills Ex.P1 to Ex.P29, it is clear that petitioner spent Rs.11,597/- on her treatment. Accordingly, Rs.11,600/- is awarded to petitioner under the head of medical bills and treatment charges. 23.Compensation has also been claimed under the head permanent disability. As per Disability Certificate Ex.P30, disability of 5% has been assessed due to mild back ache. It is also clear that the disability is provisional and not permanent. Accordingly, it is held that petitioner is not entitled to any compensation under the head of permanent disability. 24.Now coming to loss of income. Petitioner remained hospitalized and under treatment. As per Certificate Ex.P52, issued by Guru Nanak Institute of Technology, petitioner was working as Care Taker in Girls' Hostel and was drawing salary of Rs.8000/- per month. She remained on leave for one month and the leave for said period was without pay. So, she is entitled to get Rs.8000/- under the head of loss of income and accordingly, Rs.8000/- is awarded to claimant under the head of loss of income. 25.In addition to the amount awarded above, Rs.3000/- is awarded under the head of special diet and Rs.2000/- under the head of transportation. In total, Rs.36,600/- is awarded in favour of the petitioner on account of the injuries suffered by the petitioner in the accident.

Hospital, Ambala and was earning Rs.10,000/- per month. 27.In order to support his version regarding amount spent by him on treatment, he placed on record his medical bills Ex.P32 to Ex.P46 and Admission Form Ex.P47.

HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 15 29.Compensation has also been claimed under the head permanent disability. He has not placed on record any document in support of any disability.

All other material averments were denied and dismissal of the claim petition was prayed for. 8)Respondent No.5 Insurance Company contested the petition by filing separate written statement that driver of the offending vehicle/respondent No.4 was not having valid and effective driving license, registration certificate and other documents at the time of alleged accident and insured willfully violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. The factum of accident as alleged by the claimants in the petitions was denied and submitted that the alleged vehicle was involved in collusion with the respondent no.4 and police just to get compensation from respondent no.5. Remaining contents of the petition were denied and prayer to dismiss the petition was made. 9)Replication was not filed. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed :- 1.Whether the accident in question took place by rash and Ajay Kumar Sharda Gyano Devi etc Versus Muzaffar Ahmad etc. 6 negligent driving of Truck bearing registration No.JK-03E- 3252 respondent no.1 Muzaffar Ahmad resulting into death of Pala Ram and injuries to Surjit Singh as alleged?

Besides oral evidence, the following documents were placed on record:- Ex.R-1 :Copy of permit of offending Truck Ex.R-2 :Copy of RC of offending truck Ex.R-3 :Copy of DL of respondent no.1. Ex.R-4 :Copy of Insurance Policy of offending Truck Ex.R-5 :Copy of Insurance Policy of alleged Sumo Ex.R-6 :Copy of Verification report of alleged Sumo. Thereafter, learned counsels closed the evidence of respondents. 12)No evidence in rebuttal was led by the petitioner. 13)I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the material placed on record. My issue-wise finding are given as under:- 14)After due consideration of the evidence of all the parties and their contentions including the case law relied upon, the findings on the above issues along with reasons for its decision are as under: ISSUE NO.1 15)In order to prove this issue, claimant Surjit Singh stepped into the witness box as PW2 and tendered in evidence his duly sworn affidavit, Ex.PW-2/A, wherein he deposed that on 6.8.2015,after dropping Harjinder Singh at Delhi Airport he was coming back to village Raiwali in Tata Sumo bearing registration No.HR37-C-3343 which was driven by respondent No.4 at moderate speed on correct side of road. Jaspal Singh, Pala Ram, Satwinder, Bansi Lal and Parveen Kumar were also traveling in Ajay Kumar Sharda Gyano Devi etc Versus Muzaffar Ahmad etc. 8 Sumo with him. When they reached in the area of Ramba T.Point, District Karnal, on G.T.Road, Ambala, respondent No.4 Diler Singh tried to over take offending vehicle. However, respondent No.1 who was driving offending vehicle rashly and negligently without any signal took a sharp cut towards his right hand side and in that process hit into left front portion of Tata Sumo as a result of which all the persons sitting in Sumo suffered multiple and grievous injuries. He further stated that he got registered FIR, Ex.P1 against respondent No.1,who is facing trial in the Court of JMIC, Karnal for causing the accident. Claimants also tendered in evidence copy of charge sheet filed under section 173 Cr.P.C., Ex.P-2 and copy of order dated 12.10.2015 passed by ld. JMIC, Karnal charge sheeting respondent no.1 for offences punishable under Sections 279, 337 and 304-A IPC. Claimants have also tendered in evidence Post-Mortem Report, Ex.P-4 of deceased Pala Ram a perusal of which shows that he had expired on account of having suffered injuries in a road side accident. 16)Respondent No.4 Diler Singh, driver of Tata Sumo bearing No.HR37C-3343 examined himself as RW2 and in his duly sworn affidavit Ex.RW2/A corroborated version of claimant. 17)Factum of accident has also not been disputed by respondent no.1 who stepped into witness box as RW-1 and tendered in evidence his duly sworn affidavit, Ex.RW1/A deposing therein that accident had taken place due to negligence of respondent No.4 who was driving offending vehicle rashly and negligently. It is argued on behalf of respondent no.1 that since claimant Surjeet and others were coming back after dropping Harjinder Singh at Airport and respondent no.4 had sleepless night and for this reason he dozed off while traveling and hit into offending vehicle Ajay Kumar Sharda Gyano Devi etc Versus Muzaffar Ahmad etc. 9 from behind. It is also pointed out that though PW2 Surjeet Singh and RW2 Diler Singh in their affidavits deposed that accident had taken place while Sumo was overtaking offending vehicle but RW2 in his cross- examination stated that it was offending vehicle which was overtaking Sumo. Ld.counsels argued that this fact itself is indicative of the fact that respondent no.1 was not negligent and has been falsely implicated in this case. However, respondent no.1 could not dispute the fact that he is facing trial for causing accident in question. Though he deposed about his false implication in case but stated that he had not moved any complaint before any higher authorities in this regard. Even no suggestion was put to respondent no.4 that he dozed off while driving and hit Offending vehicle from behind. As far as contradiction in statement of witnesses regarding overtaking of vehicles involved in accident are concerned,these are minor in nature and can not be given undue weightage. Moreover i n Girdhari Lal Versus Radhey Shyam, 1993-2 Punjab Law Reporter (Punjab and Haryana) 109, it has been held that when the driver of offending vehicle is facing trial, it can be presumed that he was responsible for causing the accident. In view of this matter, I have no hesitation to hold that Pala Ram died and Surjit Singh suffered injuries as a result of accident caused by respondent No.1 while driving the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. In view of aforesaid findings, this issue is decided in favour of petitioner and against respondents. ISSUE NO.2: 18)In view of the findings on issue no.1, it is proved that Pala Ram died in this accident. Now, the question arises as to what amount of compensation the claimants are entitled for and from whom. Ajay Kumar Sharda Gyano Devi etc Versus Muzaffar Ahmad etc. 10 19)As far as the principles governing the quantum of compensation in fatal cases are concerned, in The General Manager Kerala State R.T.C. Vs. Susamma Thomas and others I(1994) A.C.C. 346 (S.C), the Hon'ble Apex Court held that the multiplier method is the appropriate method for assessing the quantum of compensation. It is further settled that in fatal accident cases, the accepted measure of damages awarded to the dependents is the pecuniary loss suffered by them as a result of the death and this loss can be ascertained only by balancing on the one hand the loss to the claimants of the future pecuniary benefit and on the other hand, the pecuniary advantage which from whatever source comes to him by reason of the death. Thus, the balance of loss and gain to a dependent by the death, must be ascertained. 20)PW-1 Gyano Devi, widow of deceased Pala Ram, stated that her husband was working as labourer and was earning 10,000/-/-per ₹ month. He was 55 years of age at the time of his death in accident. Though no birth certificate or any other document showing date of birth of deceased has been tendered or proved in evidence by claimants, however in the claim petition, affidavit, Ex.PW1/A and in post mortem report Ex.P4, age of deceased is stated to be 55 years. In the absence of any other documentary evidence led by claimants and any contrary evidence on behalf respondents regarding age of deceased, I have no hesitation to hold that Pala Ram was 55 years old at the time of his death in accident. 21)Though according to claimants, Pala Ram was working as labourer and was earning 10,000/-/-per month ₹ but apart from their oral testimony there is no documentary evidence on record to substantiate their Ajay Kumar Sharda Gyano Devi etc Versus Muzaffar Ahmad etc. 11 version. However, as the deceased was 55 years old only, therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the case he can be treated to be daily wager and his monthly income is assessed to the tune of 9560/- which a daily ₹ wager could have easily earned as per administrative order passed by learned Deputy Commissioner, Ambala for the year 2015-16. 22)Learned counsel for the claimants has contended that the increase in monthly income of deceased by 100% towards future prospects should also be given to the claimants. In support of his submission he relied upon Vimal Kanwar and others Vs. Kishore Dan and others, 2013(3) PLR, 776 and argued that the deceased was 55 years old only therefore he would have worked for next more than 20 years and his income would have increased multifold and thus the claimants are entitled to 100% increase in the income of deceased towards future prospects. On the other hand Ld. counsel for the respondents relying upon the law laid down in the case of Uma Sharma and another Vs. Avtar Singh and others, 2012(2) PLR, 254 contended that the future prospects can be taken into account only in respect of a deceased employed in a government job. Since the deceased was in private employment, so, the claimants are not entitled for the future prospects. Moreover, Ld. counsel submitted that issue as to whether future prospect must be provided has already been referred by Hon'ble Supreme Court in National Insurance Company Ltd. Vs Pushpa and others , therefore no such increase or compensation for future prospect can be awarded in favour of claimants while determining dependency. However, this submission is devoid of merit as in case titled as Smt.Neeta W/O Kallappa Kadolkar and others vs The Divisional Manager,MSRTC, Kohlapur 2015(1) RCR Ajay Kumar Sharda Gyano Devi etc Versus Muzaffar Ahmad etc. 12 (Civil) 625 it has been held by Hon'ble Supreme Court that even in case of private employment, the future prospects can be taken into consideration to determine the loss of dependency. Now as far as National Insurance Company Ltd vs Pushpa case(Supra) is concerned, in FAO No.9363 of 2014 titled as Shri Ram General Insurance Company it has been held by Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High court that though issue of future prospects has been referred to larger bench but there ought to be certainty and mere reference to a larger bench can not fetter right of court to decide on what would be the appropriate prospect of future increase. In case titled Rajesh and others Vs Rajbir Singh and others, 2013(3) RCR(Civil), 171 the Hon'ble Apex Court had held that in case the deceased/victim was above 50 years of age at the time of accident, increase to the extent of 15% of the actual income of the deceased should be taken towards future prospects. It further held that it will be inappropriate to say that the wages or total emoluments/income of a person who is self employed or who is employed on a fixed salary without provision for annual increment etc. would remain the same throughout his life. It further held that it has now become settled law that the court should not succumb to niceties or technicalities, in such matters. Attempt of the court should be to equate, as far as possible, the misery on account of the accident with the compensation so that the injured or dependents should not face the vagaries of life on account of the discontinuance of the income earned by the victim. As held above deceased was about 50 years of the age. In view of the law laid down in the case of Rajesh and others (supra case) , 15% of the amount should be included towards future prospects in his income. Thus, his income Ajay Kumar Sharda Gyano Devi etc Versus Muzaffar Ahmad etc. 13 (including future prospects) is assessed as 9560+1434=10994/- per ₹ month. 23)The claim petition has been filed by widow and three major children of deceased. PW-1 Gyano Devi in her cross-examination stated that except one, all her children are married. Claimant No.2,3 and 4 have not stepped into witness box to depose about their dependency upon their deceased father. Learned counsel for respondents has rightly argued that claimant no.2 to 4 being married and major sons cannot be said to be dependent upon earnings of their deceased father. Therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the case no ground is made out to award any compensation to claimant no.2 to 4. However, deceased had many social and other obligations towards his sons and daughters, therefore, he cannot be expected to have spent one half of his income upon himself as argued by respondents. Thus, after deducting one third of income for personal expenses of deceased, the monthly dependency of claimant No.1 comes to 7366/-. ₹ 24)As the deceased was 55 years of age at the time of death in accident, therefore, i n view of the law laid down in the case of Sarla Verma's case (supra) multiplier of 11 would be suitable on this case. Thus, claimants are entitled to 7366 x12 x 11= 972312/- ₹ 25) In Rajesh Versus Rajbir Singh, 2013(3) RCR (Civil)-170 and Sanobanu Nazirbhai Mirza & Ors. Versus Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service, 2013(3) Apex Court Judgments-413 (SC) widow was held entitled to 1,00,000/- for loss of consortium. However, ₹ admittedly during pendency of claim petition claimant Gyano expired on 28.6.2017, therefore, it would be fair to grant compensation to the tune of 25,000/- ₹ Ajay Kumar Sharda Gyano Devi etc Versus Muzaffar Ahmad etc. 14 only for loss of consortium to her. Claimant is further awarded 25,000/- ₹ for funeral expenses as per aforesaid cases. Thus, in all, claimant no.1 is held entitled to total compensation of 10,22,312/- i.e. 10,22,000/-(round ₹ figure) to be paid jointly and severally by all respondents. Hence, this issue is decided in favour of claimants no.1 and against claimants no.2 to 4 and respondents. (2 nd claim petition) . 26)PW2 Surjit Singh, claimant, stated that as a result of accident, he suffered multiple and serious injuries including fracture in upper and lower jaw and dislocation of teeth. Immediately, after the accident, he was taken to Civil Hospital, Karnal, from where after first aid, due to serious condition, he was shifted to Munjal's Dental Care, Ambala Cantt where he was operated upon and implants were inserted in lower jaw. He remained admitted in said hospital from 6.8.2015 to 7.8.2015 and he is still under treatment as out door patient. In support of his submission, he tendered in evidence Ex.P6 i.e. a certificate issued by Dr. Gaurav Munjal of Munjal's Complete Dental Care, Ambala Cantt, a perusal of which shows that micro plating of three fractures in interior mandible was done for three fracture suffered by the claimant. 27)Thus, from conjoint reading of afore referred evidence, it is clear that claimant must have suffered a lot of mental and physical pain agony for which, he is awarded 50,000/- as compensation. ₹ 28)Claimant has also tendered in evidence medical bills Ex.P5, Ex.P7 to Ex.P14 for 45017/-. Learned counsel for respondent has argued ₹ that these bills cannot be taken into consideration as petitioner had not examined any doctor or chemist to prove her injuries and bills in question. Ajay Kumar Sharda Gyano Devi etc Versus Muzaffar Ahmad etc. 15 However, this submission is devoid of merit. In Smt. Parsanni Devi Versus Sube Singh & Others, 2011 (2) PLR-764 , it has been held by Hon'ble High Court that practice of merely marking medical bills but not exhibiting without any evidence and looking for proof by examination of a chemist is quite a needless exercise. Tribunals must be more pragnatic in their approach while dealing with cases for motor accident victims and invoking the powers which is vested in them under Sections 168, 169 in such a fashion that they do not shackle themselves by unrealistic procedures to meet the ends of justice. Unless, the bills seems fabricated or there is something more peculiar at the trial to doubt genuineness of the bills, the Tribunal dealing with motor accident cases ought not to be looking for evidence through a chemist who had issued bills. The production of bills relating to purchase of medicines during the period of hospitalization and oral evidence given by parties about purchase of medicines ought to be taken as sufficient proof of authentication and admissibility of these documents. Thus, claimant is awarded Rs.45017/- on account of treatment expenses. The claimant is further awarded 50,000/- on account of transportation charges, attendant charges and for₹ special diet which he must have to take to recover from illness. 29)Regarding loss of income, claimant stated that he was a shopkeeper and was earning 10,000/-per month ₹ but apart from his oral testimony there is no documentary evidence on record to substantiate his version. However, as the claimant is a young person therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the case he can be treated to be daily wager and his monthly income is assessed to the tune of 9560/- which a daily wager ₹ could have easily earned as per administrative order passed by learned Ajay Kumar Sharda Gyano Devi etc Versus Muzaffar Ahmad etc. 16 Deputy Commissioner, Ambala for the year 2015-16. On account of injuries suffered by him claimant must have remained out of job for at least 6 months. Thus, he is awarded 9560x6= 57360/- for loss of income ₹ ₹ In all claimant Surjeet is awarded 2,02,377/- i.e 2,02,000(round figure) ₹ ₹ for injuries suffered by him in accident. ISSUE No.3 30)Respondent No.1 tendered in evidence copy of driving licence Ex.R3 authenticity and genuineness of which has not been disputed by counsel for Insurance Company. Therefore, it is held that at the time of accident, respondent No.1 was holding a valid licence to drive the offending vehicle. As such this issue is decided against respondent No.3 ISSUE NO.4 (RELIEF) 31) Keeping in view my observations, discussion and reasoning on the aforesaid issues, the claim petition is partly allowed with costs. An amount of 2,02,000/-₹( Two Lacs & Two Thousand only) ₹ is hereby awarded in favour of claimant in MACP No.339 titled as Surjit Singh Versus Muzaffar Ahmad & Ors . Claimants no.1 is awarded 12,22,000/-₹ as compensation in MACP No.284 titled as Gyano Devi & Ors. Versus Muzaffar Ahmad & Ors. The claimants in both the petitions shall also be entitled to interest @ 9% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization. Out of awarded amount 50% of the amount shall be kept in FDR for a period of 5 years and remaining amount shall be released in favour in cash in favour of legal heirs of Gyano Devi in equal share whereas entire amount awarded to claimant Surjeet Singh will be disbursed to him in cash. Ajay Kumar Sharda Gyano Devi etc Versus Muzaffar Ahmad etc. 17 32) In view of the directions of the Hon’ble High court vide letter no. 24887 Gaz.II 17 dated 19.7.2011 passed in Civil Revision No. 7407 of 2010 titled Jyoti Burmi vs. Anusandeep Burmi, the insurance company is directed to deposit the amount directly in the account of the claimant after obtaining her account number under intimation to this court. Claimant is directed to furnish her bank account to the insurance company within a period of one week. Counsel fee is assessed Rs. 2200/- on each side. Memo of costs be prepared and file be consigned to record room after due compliance. Pronounced in open Court on this 25th day of September, 2017.

Ex.P-3 :Copy of the Charge Sheet Ex.P-4 :Copy of the Postmortem Report Ex.P-5 to P-14 :Medical/Medicine bills/receipt of injured Surjit Singh Mark-A :Copy of Insurance Policy of offending Truck Mark-B :Copy of Insurance Policy of alleged Sumo Thereafter, ld. Counsel for the petitioners closed the evidence. 11)On the other hand, the respondents have examined Vinay Sharma as RW-1, respondent no.1 himself stepped into witness box as RW-2 (wrongly mentioned as RW-1) and respondent no.4 stepped into Ajay Kumar Sharda Gyano Devi etc Versus Muzaffar Ahmad etc. 7 witness box as RW-3 (wrongly mentioned as RW-2). Besides oral evidence, the following documents were placed on record:- Ex.R-1 :Copy of permit of offending Truck Ex.R-2 :Copy of RC of offending truck Ex.R-3 :Copy of DL of respondent no.1. Ex.R-4 :Copy of Insurance Policy of offending Truck Ex.R-5 :Copy of Insurance Policy of alleged Sumo Ex.R-6 :Copy of Verification report of alleged Sumo. Thereafter, learned counsels closed the evidence of respondents. 12)No evidence in rebuttal was led by the petitioner. 13)I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the material placed on record. My issue-wise finding are given as under:- 14)After due consideration of the evidence of all the parties and their contentions including the case law relied upon, the findings on the above issues along with reasons for its decision are as under: ISSUE NO.1 15)In order to prove this issue, claimant Surjit Singh stepped into the witness box as PW2 and tendered in evidence his duly sworn affidavit, Ex.PW-2/A, wherein he deposed that on 6.8.2015,after dropping Harjinder Singh at Delhi Airport he was coming back to village Raiwali in Tata Sumo bearing registration No.HR37-C-3343 which was driven by respondent No.4 at moderate speed on correct side of road. Jaspal Singh, Pala Ram, Satwinder, Bansi Lal and Parveen Kumar were also traveling in Ajay Kumar Sharda Gyano Devi etc Versus Muzaffar Ahmad etc. 8 Sumo with him. When they reached in the area of Ramba T.Point, District Karnal, on G.T.Road, Ambala, respondent No.4 Diler Singh tried to over take offending vehicle. However, respondent No.1 who was driving offending vehicle rashly and negligently without any signal took a sharp cut towards his right hand side and in that process hit into left front portion of Tata Sumo as a result of which all the persons sitting in Sumo suffered multiple and grievous injuries. He further stated that he got registered FIR, Ex.P1 against respondent No.1,who is facing trial in the Court of JMIC, Karnal for causing the accident. Claimants also tendered in evidence copy of charge sheet filed under section 173 Cr.P.C., Ex.P-2 and copy of order dated 12.10.2015 passed by ld. JMIC, Karnal charge sheeting respondent no.1 for offences punishable under Sections 279, 337 and 304-A IPC. Claimants have also tendered in evidence Post-Mortem Report, Ex.P-4 of deceased Pala Ram a perusal of which shows that he had expired on account of having suffered injuries in a road side accident. 16)Respondent No.4 Diler Singh, driver of Tata Sumo bearing No.HR37C-3343 examined himself as RW2 and in his duly sworn affidavit Ex.RW2/A corroborated version of claimant. 17)Factum of accident has also not been disputed by respondent no.1 who stepped into witness box as RW-1 and tendered in evidence his duly sworn affidavit, Ex.RW1/A deposing therein that accident had taken place due to negligence of respondent No.4 who was driving offending vehicle rashly and negligently. It is argued on behalf of respondent no.1 that since claimant Surjeet and others were coming back after dropping Harjinder Singh at Airport and respondent no.4 had sleepless night and for this reason he dozed off while traveling and hit into offending vehicle Ajay Kumar Sharda Gyano Devi etc Versus Muzaffar Ahmad etc. 9 from behind. It is also pointed out that though PW2 Surjeet Singh and RW2 Diler Singh in their affidavits deposed that accident had taken place while Sumo was overtaking offending vehicle but RW2 in his cross- examination stated that it was offending vehicle which was overtaking Sumo. Ld.counsels argued that this fact itself is indicative of the fact that respondent no.1 was not negligent and has been falsely implicated in this case. However, respondent no.1 could not dispute the fact that he is facing trial for causing accident in question. Though he deposed about his false implication in case but stated that he had not moved any complaint before any higher authorities in this regard. Even no suggestion was put to respondent no.4 that he dozed off while driving and hit Offending vehicle from behind. As far as contradiction in statement of witnesses regarding overtaking of vehicles involved in accident are concerned,these are minor in nature and can not be given undue weightage. Moreover i n Girdhari Lal Versus Radhey Shyam, 1993-2 Punjab Law Reporter (Punjab and Haryana) 109, it has been held that when the driver of offending vehicle is facing trial, it can be presumed that he was responsible for causing the accident. In view of this matter, I have no hesitation to hold that Pala Ram died and Surjit Singh suffered injuries as a result of accident caused by respondent No.1 while driving the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. In view of aforesaid findings, this issue is decided in favour of petitioner and against respondents. ISSUE NO.2: 18)In view of the findings on issue no.1, it is proved that Pala Ram died in this accident. Now, the question arises as to what amount of compensation the claimants are entitled for and from whom. Ajay Kumar Sharda Gyano Devi etc Versus Muzaffar Ahmad etc. 10 19)As far as the principles governing the quantum of compensation in fatal cases are concerned, in The General Manager Kerala State R.T.C. Vs. Susamma Thomas and others I(1994) A.C.C. 346 (S.C), the Hon'ble Apex Court held that the multiplier method is the appropriate method for assessing the quantum of compensation. It is further settled that in fatal accident cases, the accepted measure of damages awarded to the dependents is the pecuniary loss suffered by them as a result of the death and this loss can be ascertained only by balancing on the one hand the loss to the claimants of the future pecuniary benefit and on the other hand, the pecuniary advantage which from whatever source comes to him by reason of the death. Thus, the balance of loss and gain to a dependent by the death, must be ascertained. 20)PW-1 Gyano Devi, widow of deceased Pala Ram, stated that her husband was working as labourer and was earning 10,000/-/-per ₹ month. He was 55 years of age at the time of his death in accident. Though no birth certificate or any other document showing date of birth of deceased has been tendered or proved in evidence by claimants, however in the claim petition, affidavit, Ex.PW1/A and in post mortem report Ex.P4, age of deceased is stated to be 55 years. In the absence of any other documentary evidence led by claimants and any contrary evidence on behalf respondents regarding age of deceased, I have no hesitation to hold that Pala Ram was 55 years old at the time of his death in accident. 21)Though according to claimants, Pala Ram was working as labourer and was earning 10,000/-/-per month ₹ but apart from their oral testimony there is no documentary evidence on record to substantiate their Ajay Kumar Sharda Gyano Devi etc Versus Muzaffar Ahmad etc. 11 version. However, as the deceased was 55 years old only, therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the case he can be treated to be daily wager and his monthly income is assessed to the tune of 9560/- which a daily ₹ wager could have easily earned as per administrative order passed by learned Deputy Commissioner, Ambala for the year 2015-16. 22)Learned counsel for the claimants has contended that the increase in monthly income of deceased by 100% towards future prospects should also be given to the claimants. In support of his submission he relied upon Vimal Kanwar and others Vs. Kishore Dan and others, 2013(3) PLR, 776 and argued that the deceased was 55 years old only therefore he would have worked for next more than 20 years and his income would have increased multifold and thus the claimants are entitled to 100% increase in the income of deceased towards future prospects. On the other hand Ld. counsel for the respondents relying upon the law laid down in the case of Uma Sharma and another Vs. Avtar Singh and others, 2012(2) PLR, 254 contended that the future prospects can be taken into account only in respect of a deceased employed in a government job. Since the deceased was in private employment, so, the claimants are not entitled for the future prospects. Moreover, Ld. counsel submitted that issue as to whether future prospect must be provided has already been referred by Hon'ble Supreme Court in National Insurance Company Ltd. Vs Pushpa and others , therefore no such increase or compensation for future prospect can be awarded in favour of claimants while determining dependency. However, this submission is devoid of merit as in case titled as Smt.Neeta W/O Kallappa Kadolkar and others vs The Divisional Manager,MSRTC, Kohlapur 2015(1) RCR Ajay Kumar Sharda Gyano Devi etc Versus Muzaffar Ahmad etc. 12 (Civil) 625 it has been held by Hon'ble Supreme Court that even in case of private employment, the future prospects can be taken into consideration to determine the loss of dependency. Now as far as National Insurance Company Ltd vs Pushpa case(Supra) is concerned, in FAO No.9363 of 2014 titled as Shri Ram General Insurance Company it has been held by Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High court that though issue of future prospects has been referred to larger bench but there ought to be certainty and mere reference to a larger bench can not fetter right of court to decide on what would be the appropriate prospect of future increase. In case titled Rajesh and others Vs Rajbir Singh and others, 2013(3) RCR(Civil), 171 the Hon'ble Apex Court had held that in case the deceased/victim was above 50 years of age at the time of accident, increase to the extent of 15% of the actual income of the deceased should be taken towards future prospects. It further held that it will be inappropriate to say that the wages or total emoluments/income of a person who is self employed or who is employed on a fixed salary without provision for annual increment etc. would remain the same throughout his life. It further held that it has now become settled law that the court should not succumb to niceties or technicalities, in such matters. Attempt of the court should be to equate, as far as possible, the misery on account of the accident with the compensation so that the injured or dependents should not face the vagaries of life on account of the discontinuance of the income earned by the victim. As held above deceased was about 50 years of the age. In view of the law laid down in the case of Rajesh and others (supra case) , 15% of the amount should be included towards future prospects in his income. Thus, his income Ajay Kumar Sharda Gyano Devi etc Versus Muzaffar Ahmad etc. 13 (including future prospects) is assessed as 9560+1434=10994/- per ₹ month. 23)The claim petition has been filed by widow and three major children of deceased. PW-1 Gyano Devi in her cross-examination stated that except one, all her children are married. Claimant No.2,3 and 4 have not stepped into witness box to depose about their dependency upon their deceased father. Learned counsel for respondents has rightly argued that claimant no.2 to 4 being married and major sons cannot be said to be dependent upon earnings of their deceased father. Therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the case no ground is made out to award any compensation to claimant no.2 to 4. However, deceased had many social and other obligations towards his sons and daughters, therefore, he cannot be expected to have spent one half of his income upon himself as argued by respondents. Thus, after deducting one third of income for personal expenses of deceased, the monthly dependency of claimant No.1 comes to 7366/-. ₹ 24)As the deceased was 55 years of age at the time of death in accident, therefore, i n view of the law laid down in the case of Sarla Verma's case (supra) multiplier of 11 would be suitable on this case. Thus, claimants are entitled to 7366 x12 x 11= 972312/- ₹ 25) In Rajesh Versus Rajbir Singh, 2013(3) RCR (Civil)-170 and Sanobanu Nazirbhai Mirza & Ors. Versus Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service, 2013(3) Apex Court Judgments-413 (SC) widow was held entitled to 1,00,000/- for loss of consortium. However, ₹ admittedly during pendency of claim petition claimant Gyano expired on 28.6.2017, therefore, it would be fair to grant compensation to the tune of 25,000/- ₹ Ajay Kumar Sharda Gyano Devi etc Versus Muzaffar Ahmad etc. 14 only for loss of consortium to her. Claimant is further awarded 25,000/- ₹ for funeral expenses as per aforesaid cases. Thus, in all, claimant no.1 is held entitled to total compensation of 10,22,312/- i.e. 10,22,000/-(round ₹ figure) to be paid jointly and severally by all respondents. Hence, this issue is decided in favour of claimants no.1 and against claimants no.2 to 4 and respondents. (2 nd claim petition) . 26)PW2 Surjit Singh, claimant, stated that as a result of accident, he suffered multiple and serious injuries including fracture in upper and lower jaw and dislocation of teeth. Immediately, after the accident, he was taken to Civil Hospital, Karnal, from where after first aid, due to serious condition, he was shifted to Munjal's Dental Care, Ambala Cantt where he was operated upon and implants were inserted in lower jaw. He remained admitted in said hospital from 6.8.2015 to 7.8.2015 and he is still under treatment as out door patient. In support of his submission, he tendered in evidence Ex.P6 i.e. a certificate issued by Dr. Gaurav Munjal of Munjal's Complete Dental Care, Ambala Cantt, a perusal of which shows that micro plating of three fractures in interior mandible was done for three fracture suffered by the claimant. 27)Thus, from conjoint reading of afore referred evidence, it is clear that claimant must have suffered a lot of mental and physical pain agony for which, he is awarded 50,000/- as compensation. ₹ 28)Claimant has also tendered in evidence medical bills Ex.P5, Ex.P7 to Ex.P14 for 45017/-. Learned counsel for respondent has argued ₹ that these bills cannot be taken into consideration as petitioner had not examined any doctor or chemist to prove her injuries and bills in question. Ajay Kumar Sharda Gyano Devi etc Versus Muzaffar Ahmad etc. 15 However, this submission is devoid of merit. In Smt. Parsanni Devi Versus Sube Singh & Others, 2011 (2) PLR-764 , it has been held by Hon'ble High Court that practice of merely marking medical bills but not exhibiting without any evidence and looking for proof by examination of a chemist is quite a needless exercise. Tribunals must be more pragnatic in their approach while dealing with cases for motor accident victims and invoking the powers which is vested in them under Sections 168, 169 in such a fashion that they do not shackle themselves by unrealistic procedures to meet the ends of justice. Unless, the bills seems fabricated or there is something more peculiar at the trial to doubt genuineness of the bills, the Tribunal dealing with motor accident cases ought not to be looking for evidence through a chemist who had issued bills. The production of bills relating to purchase of medicines during the period of hospitalization and oral evidence given by parties about purchase of medicines ought to be taken as sufficient proof of authentication and admissibility of these documents. Thus, claimant is awarded Rs.45017/- on account of treatment expenses. The claimant is further awarded 50,000/- on account of transportation charges, attendant charges and for₹ special diet which he must have to take to recover from illness. 29)Regarding loss of income, claimant stated that he was a shopkeeper and was earning 10,000/-per month ₹ but apart from his oral testimony there is no documentary evidence on record to substantiate his version. However, as the claimant is a young person therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the case he can be treated to be daily wager and his monthly income is assessed to the tune of 9560/- which a daily wager ₹ could have easily earned as per administrative order passed by learned Ajay Kumar Sharda Gyano Devi etc Versus Muzaffar Ahmad etc. 16 Deputy Commissioner, Ambala for the year 2015-16. On account of injuries suffered by him claimant must have remained out of job for at least 6 months. Thus, he is awarded 9560x6= 57360/- for loss of income ₹ ₹ In all claimant Surjeet is awarded 2,02,377/- i.e 2,02,000(round figure) ₹ ₹ for injuries suffered by him in accident. ISSUE No.3 30)Respondent No.1 tendered in evidence copy of driving licence Ex.R3 authenticity and genuineness of which has not been disputed by counsel for Insurance Company. Therefore, it is held that at the time of accident, respondent No.1 was holding a valid licence to drive the offending vehicle. As such this issue is decided against respondent No.3 ISSUE NO.4 (RELIEF) 31) Keeping in view my observations, discussion and reasoning on the aforesaid issues, the claim petition is partly allowed with costs. An amount of 2,02,000/-₹( Two Lacs & Two Thousand only) ₹ is hereby awarded in favour of claimant in MACP No.339 titled as Surjit Singh Versus Muzaffar Ahmad & Ors . Claimants no.1 is awarded 12,22,000/-₹ as compensation in MACP No.284 titled as Gyano Devi & Ors. Versus Muzaffar Ahmad & Ors. The claimants in both the petitions shall also be entitled to interest @ 9% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization. Out of awarded amount 50% of the amount shall be kept in FDR for a period of 5 years and remaining amount shall be released in favour in cash in favour of legal heirs of Gyano Devi in equal share whereas entire amount awarded to claimant Surjeet Singh will be disbursed to him in cash. Ajay Kumar Sharda Gyano Devi etc Versus Muzaffar Ahmad etc. 17 32) In view of the directions of the Hon’ble High court vide letter no. 24887 Gaz.II 17 dated 19.7.2011 passed in Civil Revision No. 7407 of 2010 titled Jyoti Burmi vs. Anusandeep Burmi, the insurance company is directed to deposit the amount directly in the account of the claimant after obtaining her account number under intimation to this court. Claimant is directed to furnish her bank account to the insurance company within a period of one week. Counsel fee is assessed Rs. 2200/- on each side. Memo of costs be prepared and file be consigned to record room after due compliance. Pronounced in open Court on this 25th day of September, 2017.

JA VEDA KHATUN ETC VS LAKINDER SINGH ETC 2 -.- Present:- Shri Anil Kumar Kaushik, counsel for the petitioners. Shri Sanjeev Vashisht, counsel for the respondent No.1 & 2. Shri S. C. Jaiswal, counsel for the respondent No.3. AWARD:- Claimants 'being first class legal heirs of Abdul Sitar, have brought the instant petition 'under Section 166 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, for claiming compensation of Rs.25,00,000/- along with interest @ 12% per annum, on account of death of Sh. Abdul Sitar son of Sh. Umerdin @ Umera, resident of Village Samlehri, Tehsil Saha, District Ambala, who died in a road side accident, which was taken place on 20.09.2014 at about 8.50 P.M, near ESSAR petrol pump on NH-2 within the area of Police Station Etmadpur, District Agra and FIR No. 234 dated 20.09.2014 under sections 279, 304-A IPC was registered against the respondent No.1 Lakinder Singh at Police Station Etmadpur. 2The necessary first part of petition relating to accident dated 20.09.2014 are that Sh. Abdul Sitar was working as driver with M/s MG Constructions Pvt. Ltd. Nagla Ram Baksh Kuber Pur, Agra. On 20.09.2014 at about 8.50 PM, he had gone to the Canteen of ESSAR petrol pump on NH-2 after crossing the road on other side to purchase some goods. After purchasing the goods, he was returning from Canteen of ESSAR petrol pump and was waiting on the bank of road to cross the same, meanwhile, a Tanker bearing registration No. UP-85P-9492 came from Agra side, being driven by its driver respondent No.1 so rashly and negligently and at very high speed, and hit directly to Abdul Sitar by JA VEDA KHATUN ETC VS LAKINDER SINGH ETC 3 coming on the bank of road on kachha portion, as a result of that, he suffered fatal injuries and succumbed to injuries on the spot. This occurrence was witnessed by Sh. Sanjay Singh son of Sh. Prem Narayan, who was also working with the deceased and was present on the spot. Doctor of Civil Hospital Agra has conducted the autopsy on 21.09.2014. Second part of the claim petition with regard to family status and income of deceased are that, claimant No.1 is widow, claimants No. 2 and 3 are the sons of the deceased. At the time of death, the deceased was hale and hearty aged 48 years and was enjoying very good health and physique and was free from all vices. The deceased was an expert driver and was earning Rs.12,000/- per month approximately and was sole bread earner of the family and due to his sudden death, the life of claimants has been ruined and entire family is under the great mental shock. The claimants were fully dependent upon the income of the deceased. The claimants have spent Rs.50,000/- on the last rites of the deceased. In the end of petition, it is pleaded that t his accident was caused due to sole rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1/ driver of Tanker bearing Registration No. UP-85P-9492, which is owned by respondent No.2 and insured with respondent No.3. Hence, all respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the claimants . 3Upon notice, respondent No.1 and 2, contested this claim petition by filing written statement. They took some preliminary objections regarding maintainability; locus-standi; that no accident has JA VEDA KHATUN ETC VS LAKINDER SINGH ETC 4 taken place with the vehicle in question of the answering respondents on the alleged date and time and respondent No.1 and 2 have been falsely implicated by the police in connivance with the claimants. On merit, they denied entire facts of the accident as well as family status of deceased. It is further submitted that false case at the instance of claimants was registered against respondent No.1. The amount claimed is highly exaggerated and can not be permitted under any law. As a matter of fact, no accident took place with the vehicle of the answering respondents which has been falsely implicated and this fact was also disclosed with the police, but the police asked him to prove his version in the Court. In view of the facts stated above, claim petition is liable to be dismissed. 4The respondent No.3 (insurance company) filed separate written statement inter-alia with preliminary objections regarding concealment of true and material facts; respondent No1 was not holding valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident; that petition has been filed in connivance with respondent No.1 and 2 and respondent No.3 takes all the defences without prejudice to their right under section 149 (2), 169/170 of the M.V . Act and the alleged offending vehicle was not having valid route permit, fitness certificate etc at the time of the alleged accident. On merit, it is submitted that claim petition is false, frivolous, motivated and concocted one and petitioners are not entitled to claim compensation. The alleged accident is denied. It is wrong that the deceased was earning Rs.12,000/- per month. The age of the deceased was more than 60 years at the time of alleged accident as in JA VEDA KHATUN ETC VS LAKINDER SINGH ETC 5 the Haryana Government Ration Card issued on 15.03.2013, the age of the deceased was mentioned as 58 years. The income of the deceased is false and malafide. The alleged eye witness has been planted by the police in connivance with the claimant and insured. It is further submitted that alleged offending vehicle was being driven in violation of the conditions of the insurance policy, if any. However, the liability of the answering respondent is subject to the conditions of the insurance policy. It is wrong that claimants are legal heirs and dependents upon the deceased. Rests of facts are denied and prayed for dismissal the petition with costs. 5Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed vide order dated 18.08.2015:- 1Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1 while driving Tanker bearing registration No. UP-85P-9492, resulting into causing death of Abdul Sitar, as alleged? OPP. 2If Issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom, the claimants are entitled to? OPP. 3Whether petition is not maintainable in the present form? OPR. 4Whether the petitioners have no locus-standi to file the present petition ?OPR 5Whether the petitioners have not come to the court with clean hands and have suppressed true and material facts from the court ? OPR 6Whether respondent no.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect? OPR. 7Whether respondent no.3 is entitled to take all the defences available to it under the M.V . Act ? OPR. JA VEDA KHATUN ETC VS LAKINDER SINGH ETC 6 8Relief. 6 To establish their claim, petitioners examined the following testimonies:- PW1 Sanjay Singh , (eye witness of accident) tendered his affidavit Ex.PW1/A reiterated the factum of accident dated 20.09.2014 at about 8.50 PM, which was taken place due to rash and negligent driving of Tanker bearing registration No. UP-85P-9492 near ESSAR petrol pump on NH-2. In cross-examination, he answered that he is working as Account Officer in M.G. Construction P. Ltd since the year 2009. His office is situated at Nagla Rambaksh Kuberpur, Agra which is site office. The accident took place in front of their site office after crossing the road. The place of accident is 100 feet away from their office. Abdul Sitar was working in their company since 2002, but he was working in their site office since 2011. He was Tipper driver. He was also cross-examined on various other questions by counsel for respondent No.3. PW2 Rajesh Verma {Manager of M.G. Construction Pvt. Ltd Panchkula ,} has proved the Pay slip of deceased as Ex.P1 and authority letter as Ex.P2. In cross-examination, he answered that deceased was permanent employee in their company and was drawing fixed salary. He does not know prior to year 2002 what deceased was doing. He has not brought the qualification, age proof of the deceased, which was not summoned. Documents Ex.P1 and Ex.P2 were not prepared by him nor same were prepared in his presence, however same were signed by the Director of their company. He was also cross examined on other JA VEDA KHATUN ETC VS LAKINDER SINGH ETC 7 questions. PW3 Javeda Khatun (widow of deceased) tendered her affidavit Ex.PW3/A reiterating the facts with regard to status of family and income of deceased. In cross-examination, she answered that her husband Abdul Sitar was Matriculate. She came to know the accident of her husband about 9.45/10.00 PM on the day of accident. She was informed by the police on telephone about the accident of her husband and told her to come immediately. Her son and her brother went to Agra on the same night. Her elder is 20 years of age and younger son is 18 years of age. Both of them are studying in B.Com first year. Her husband was driver prior to her marriage. Her marriage was solemnized about 21 years ago. Her husband was working with M/s MG Construction P. Ltd for last 12/13 years. She does not know how much salary was drawn by her husband about five years ago. She is getting blind pension and some time her brother helped her financially. She is getting Rs.1200/- as blind pension. She is 49 years of age. Her husband was one year elder to her again said he was one year younger to her. Her husband used to deposit his salary in his account of which ATM was with her. He used to sent Rs.12,000/- monthly. Learned counsel for claimants tendered documents i.e copy of FIR as Ex.P3, PMR of deceased as Ex.P4, school leaving certificate Mark-A, copy of death certificate of Abdul Sitar as Mark-B and closed his evidence. On the other hand, following witnesses are examined by Respondent no.1 to 3; JA VEDA KHATUN ETC VS LAKINDER SINGH ETC 8 RW1 Sh. H. S. Raghav has been examined by respondent No.3,who stated that he is doing investigation job and on the penal of various public undertaking insurance companies. He had investigated thousands of cases pertaining to accident etc. In this case, he was entrusted with the investigation of the case arising out of accident bearing FIR No.234/14 dated 20.09.2014 by the United India Insurance Company and as such he carried out the investigation and it was found that tanker No. UP-85P-9492 was not involved in the alleged accident resulting in death of Abdul Sattar. He further stated about his investigation and produced documents Ex.P5 to Ex.P11 in his evidence. In cross- examination, he answered that he is a private professional investigator in various Insurance companies. He has no certificate from government to investigate the cases parallel to police. He had given so many evidence in court of law, similarly, he is giving evidence in this case as investigator. It is incorrect to suggest that he has not been authorized by respondent No.3 to investigate and give evidence in this case. He is not eye witness to the accident. He was also cross-examined on other questions by claimants' counsel. RW2 Lakinder Singh {respondent No.1} denied the accident in question in his chief-examination. In cross-examination put forth by counsel for claimants, he answered that it is correct that on 20.09.2014, he was the driver of tanker bearing registration No. UP-85-P-9492. It is correct that Mathura-Agra road is a four lane highway. It is incorrect to suggest that on four lane highway the heavy vehicles used to run at a speed of 70-80 KMPH. It is correct that Ex.R5 does not bear my JA VEDA KHATUN ETC VS LAKINDER SINGH ETC 9 signatures but bears the signatures of official of the petrol pump. It is also correct that no time is mentioned in Ex.R5. He does not know Sanjay Singh son of Sh. Prem Narain. It is correct that FIR No. 234 dated 20.09.2014 was registered in Police Station Etmadpur under section 304 IPC. He went to police station in this case from where he was released on police bail. He was not given any clean chit certificate in this case by the police. It is correct that on the date of occurrence after accident his tanker stopped near ESSAR petrol pump. He was also cross-examined on various other questions. Learned counsel for Respondent no.1 and 2 also tendered documents i.e copy of DL as Ex.R1, Copy of RC as Ex.R2, copy of fitness certificate as Ex.R3 Copy of route permit as Ex.R4 and closed their evidence. Learned counsel for respondent No.3 also tendered copy of insurance policy as Ex.R12 and evidence of respondent No.3 was closed by order of this Tribunal. No rebuttal evidence was led, though opportunity for the same was granted and same was closed on 19.01.2016. however learned counsel for respondent no.3, sought permission of this tribunal to tender copy of Ration card of deceased which was allowed and then he produced copy of ration card as Mark .DA and closed the same. 7I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on various issues are as under: ISSUE NO.1: 8 Under this issue, claimants-petitioners are required to establish fact that motor vehicular accident was occurred 'due to sole rash and JA VEDA KHATUN ETC VS LAKINDER SINGH ETC 10 negligent driving of Respondent no.1, resulting, death of Abdul Sitar and as such, they being first class legal heirs and dependents are entitled to appropriate compensation from respondents who are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation amount. 9 Learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that accident in question was taken place due to sole rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1, resulting death of Abdul Sitar, therefore, respondent No.1, driver, respondent No.2 owner and respondent no.3 insurer, are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the petitioners and prayed for allowing the petition. 10 On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent no.1&2 has submitted that no such accident, as alleged, was ever taken place with the involvement of offending vehicle, thus, no negligence could be attributed to the respondent No.1, in this view of the matter, no liability can be fastened upon respondent No 1&2 to pay any compensation to the petitioners. He further argued that for the sake of discussion, if accident was taken place 'though not admitted, even then, Respondent no.1 was holding valid license as Ex.R1, at the day of alleged accident and respondent no.2 was owner of offending vehicle as per RC as Ex.R2 and copy of fitness certificate as Ex.R3 and Copy of route permit as Ex.R4. The offending vehicle was also insured vide policy EX.R12 with respondent no.3, therefore, respondent no.3 is liable to indemnify the insured and prayed for dismissal the petition against them. 11 Learned counsel for respondent no.3 has submitted that no JA VEDA KHATUN ETC VS LAKINDER SINGH ETC 11 such accident, as alleged, was ever taken place with the involvement of offending vehicle rather unidentified vehicle had occurred accident with deceased and thus, no negligence could be attributed to the respondent No.1, in this view of the matter, no liability can be fastened upon respondent No.3, to pay any compensation to the petitioners. He further argued that claimants are not dependent upon the income of deceased and claimant no.1 is getting monthly blind pension of Rs.1200/-. He further argued that the age of deceased was 58 years instead of 48 at the time of death as per entry in the Ration card Mark-DA, but claimants did not disclose the exact date of birth of deceased and prayed for dismissal the petition. 12 I have given due regard to the rival contentions put forth by learned counsel for respective parties and have evaluated entire oral evidence coupled with documentary evidence carefully. After thorough examination, it is observed that the petitioners-claimants have come to the Court with categorical stand that accident was taken place due to rash and negligent driving of Tanker bearing registration No. UP-85-P-9492 by Respondent No.1, resulting death of Abdul Sitar on 20.09.2014. In order to prove factum of accident, PW1 {complainant-eye witness of accident} tendered affidavit Ex.PW1/A in evidence with specific averments that accident in question took place due to sole rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1/ driver. He recorded his statement before police and then formal FIR under section 279, 304-A IPC was registered against the respondent No.1. Although, PW1 was cross examined, however, nothing JA VEDA KHATUN ETC VS LAKINDER SINGH ETC 12 can be elicited disbelieving factum of motor vehicular accident with the offending vehicle as statement of RW1 is not found sufficient to rebut the version of PW1 {who is witness of scene of crime} rather RW1 being salaried person shall depose in favour of Respondent no.3 and so his statement do not disbelieve involvement of offending vehicle in this accident. Here, respondent no.1, appeared in the witness box as RW2 but his statement is not found sufficient at all to rebut the stand taken by claimants-petitioners supporting with oral as well as documentary evidence. In accident cases, it is necessary to have the first hand report from the witness of scene of crime who can tell exact picture of accident. It is quite well settled that the lodging of the first information report is not an essential prerequisite for claiming compensation arising from a motor accident. Each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The Tribunal is expected to adjudge a case on the basis of the evidence adduced without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled position of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. It must be remembered that in a motor accident claim, the claimants are not required to prove their case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. It is trite law that claimants-petitioners are required to prove its case, which sets up the particular case relating to the accident which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts upon the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way alleged by the claimants. The provisions with regard JA VEDA KHATUN ETC VS LAKINDER SINGH ETC 13 to claim under the Act are enacted keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimants are always entitled for compensation irrespective whether the police has registered the offence regarding the incident or not because no claim case can be left over on the mercy of the police. 13 The evidence proved on record irrefutably leads to the inference that offending vehicle was involved in the motor vehicular accident and accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1, resulting death of Abdul Satar and FIR was also registered against respondent No.1 and mere non submission of final report under section 173 CRPC would not taken away the criminal rash and negligence liability of respondent no.1, and therefore, in view of case law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993 (2) P .L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008 (2) R.C.R. (Civil) 774, it can be safely held that the offending vehicle was involved in the accident in question which was taken place due to sole rash and negligent driving by respondent No.1. Accordingly, this issue no.1 is decided in favour of the claimants. ISSUE NO. 2: 14The onus to prove this issue is upon claimants. It is undisputed that deceased was married and died leaving behind his wife, two sons. The deceased was enjoying very good health and physique. Here, PW3 categorically stated that all claimants were fully dependent JA VEDA KHATUN ETC VS LAKINDER SINGH ETC 14 upon income of deceased, but due to untimely death of their only bread earner, they all have deprived from their source of income and also suffered mental shock and agony. PW3 also stated that they have spent Rs.50,000/- on transportation of dead body and funeral/ last rites of her deceased husband. Coming to question of age of deceased; it is evident that the age of deceased has been shown above 58 years in the Ration Card, whereas, in school leaving certificate, it reveals date of birth as 8.7.1965 and so age of deceased was 49 at the day of death. However, entry in Ration card can not be disbelieved as it is to maintained on the basis of information supplied by concerned and so age of deceased is taken in to consideration between 51 to 55 proportionately. However, claimants have wrongly shown age of deceased as 48 years, and monthly income of deceased as 12000/- and so it can be safely said that age of deceased was 51 to 55 years at the time of death and so multiplier of 11 is applicable as per law. It may not be out of place to mention here that the monetary compensation will never be a sufficient succor for victims of accidental cases rather their needs can only be prevented by providing just compensation. The best manner in which victims can be compensated for sufferings only to prevent recurrence of any such road incident by wrongdoer. In failure to protect or prevent the sufferings of victims due to death of their sole bread earner in road accident, it also imposes liability of state to take extra ordinary precaution to reduce such type of road accident by deputing sufficient trained traffic police or to comply JA VEDA KHATUN ETC VS LAKINDER SINGH ETC 15 with strict traffic rules to avoid such incident. It will certainly take lot of time for rehabilitation by the family members of deceased. 15 Coming to question of income of deceased; though, claimants- petitioners pleaded that deceased was earning Rs.12,000/- per month. However, PW2 categorically stated that deceased was getting fixed salary as per pay slip EX.P1. According to pay slip EX.P1, it can be gathered that deceased was getting basic salary of Rs.6500/- plus house rent allowance of Rs.2500/- plus bonus Rs.500/- and a sum of Rs.780 was deducted for PF and was getting net pay of Rs.8920/-. However, it is not understandable that house rent allowance of 2500/- is above the 1/3rd of basic salary of Rs.6500/- rather as per rules, 5 percent of basic salary is given as house rent allowance as per rules and if it is counted then it comes to Rs.325/-per month. If this amount is added in the basic salary then it comes to Rs.6825/- per month and so monthly salary of deceased can not be taken above 6825/-. 16 It would be appropriate to say that widow of deceased is getting blind pension which is not deduct-able in eyes of law. He was died on 20.9.2014 leaving behind widow, two sons below 21 years and therefore, they all are taken under his dependency. If two or three persons are dependent upon income of deceased, then 1/3th amount is deducted on account his living and personal expenses. Therefore, by considering the age of deceased between 51 to 55 years, multiplier of 11 is to be applied in view of Smt. Sarla Verma and Ors. Vs Delhi Transport Corporation and another AIR 2009 Supreme Court 3104 . By applying multiplier of JA VEDA KHATUN ETC VS LAKINDER SINGH ETC 16 11, the exact assessment of compensation would come to {54600 x11} Rs. 6,00,600/-. Additionally, petitioners being children and widow have deprived from love and affection and also suffered pain and agony due to untimely death, therefore, they are entitled to Rs.50,000/- in these head. They have also spent amount on last rites/funeral of deceased and so they are entitled to funeral expenses amounting Rs.25,000/-. The petitioner no.1 being widow is also entitled to Rs.50000/- as consortium and in this manner, total compensation is computed to Rs.7,25,000/-- which shall be payable along with interest @ 7.5/- per annum from the date of filing the petition till its realization to the petitioners. Rests of relief sought by petitioners-claimants stands declined. Accordingly, issue no.2 is decided in favour of claimants-petitioners. ISSUE NO.3 to 5 & 7 : 17The onus to prove these issues are upon Respondents but they neither pressed these issue nor led any evidence. However, it has already discussed in detail under Issue No.1 & 2 that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. In this way, it has become obvious on file that this tribunal has left with no other option except to decide these issues against Respondents. Accordingly, all these issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.6 : 18 The onus to prove this issue is upon the respondent No.3, who is under the obligation to prove this fact that the respondent No.1 was not having a valid driving licence at the time of alleged accident and JA VEDA KHATUN ETC VS LAKINDER SINGH ETC 17 as such respondent no.2 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy EX.R5 and so respondent No.3 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimants. However, there is nothing on record to show that respondent No.1 was not holding any valid license, rather same is proved as EX.R1. Further, Insurance Policy Ex.R5 reveals that offending vehicle 'as per RC EX.R2, was insured with the respondent No.3 at the relevant time. The offending vehicle was also fit to ply on road as per fitness certificate EX.R3 and route permit EX,R4. There is nothing brought on record to show that the Driving licence Ex.R1 was invalid at the day of occurrence. In the fact and circumstances, it is quite clear that the respondent no.2 did not violate or breach any covenant and condition of the insurance policy. Accordingly, this Issue is decided against the respondent No.3. ISSUE NO.8 (RELIEF): PETITION SUCCEEDS ; 19 In view of the foregoing discussion, instant claim petition stands allowed with costs in a manner that the claimants-petitioners are held entitled to compensation of Rs.7,25,000/- along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this claim petition till the date of actual payment. The awarded compensation amount along with interest shall be payable jointly and severally by respondent No.1 to 3 and respondent no.3, shall indemnify the insured. The 1/3 rd each share of claimant-petitioner No.2 to 3 shall be deposited in any nationalized bank in the shape of FDR and shall be payable to them at the time of their marriage. However, claimant-petitioner no.1 being mother shall be at JA VEDA KHATUN ETC VS LAKINDER SINGH ETC 18 liberty to receive accrued interest on their FDR either quarterly or half yearly for their education etc. The 1/3rd share of petitioner no.1, and amount of additional compensation in the shape of consortium etc shall be payable to the account of claimant-petitioner No. 1 respectively. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.3000/-. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly and file be consigned to records after due compliance. Announced in open Court.

It is further submitted that Bus in question was handed over to respondent AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 33 no.4, who has contravened the Policy. It is further submitted that as per mandatory provisions in Sub Section 6 of Section 158 of the Act, immediately on receipt of information qua death/bodily injury to a person in an accident, the Investigating Officer shall forward a copy thereof to the Claims Tribunal, insurer and owner and the owner is required to intimate the Claims Tribunal within thirty days. On merits, it is denied that claimant sustained any injury in this accident or remained admitted in any hospital or spent Rs. One lac on her treatment. It is further submitted that petition has been filed after due consultation just to get compensation from answering respondent Denying all other averments, dismissal of petition was prayed for. 18.Though separate written statements were filed by respondents in each connected claim petition, yet same stand, as taken in main MACP no.208 of 2015 titled as Aman Sharma versus Rohit Kumar and others, has been taken. 19.Replication was not filed. From pleadings of parties, following issues were framed: 1.Whether the accident in question took place by rash and negligent driving of Tipper/Dumper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635 by respondent no.1 Rohit Kumar resulting into injuries to Aman Sharma, Ajay Kumar, Pritam Singh, Yogesh, Pawan, Vivek and Amit Saini and death of Deepak Sharma, Parminder Singh, Aamir Furqan and Manish Kumar, as alleged? OPP AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 34 2If Issue no.1 is proved, then whether the claimants are entitled to compensation, if so, how much and from whom? OPP 3Whether respondent no.1 was driving offending vehicle in violation of terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy, if so, its effect? OPR (3) 4Relief 20.Petitioners, in order to prove their case, examined as many as thirteen witnesses: PW1 Harpreet Kaur PW2 Manju PW3 Aliya Khatun PW4 Pritam Singh PW5 Amit Saini PW6 Aman Sharma PW7 Alka Sharma PW8 Ajay Kumar PW9 Yogesh PW10 Pawan Kumar PW11 Dr. Vikas Paul PW12 Vivek Sharma PW13 Amarjeet In documentary evidence, documents Ex.P37 to 178 were tendered. AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 35 21.On the other hand, respondents examined RW1 Rohit Kumar/respondent no.1. In documentary evidence, documents Ex.R1 to Ex.R11 were tendered. 22.No rebuttal evidence was led. 23.After due consideration of the arguments and evidence of both parties, the findings on the above issues along with reasons for the decision are given below:- ISSUE NO.1: 24.Burden to prove this issue was upon claimants. Ld. counsel for claimants submitted that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving vehicle no.HR37C/8635 in a rash and negligent manner. Ld. counsel relied upon the statements of PW4 to PW6, PW8 to PW10 and PW12 and copy of Challan Ex.P37 and copy of charge-sheet dated 30.07.2015 Ex.P38. and submitted that respondent no.1 was responsible for causing the accident as he was driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. 25.On the other hand, ld. counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 submitted that PW10 Pawan Kumar was driving Bus no.HR68A/2180 in a rash and negligent manner and he could have avoided the accident if he had control over his Bus as he dashed his bus against the Dumper/Tipper, which had turned turtle on the road. Ld. counsel further submitted that last control was in hands of PW10 and had he been driving his bus at moderate speed, the accident could have been avoided. 26.Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 Shri Mohinder Bindal AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 36 Advocate supported the arguments raised by ld. counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 and submitted that even if it is taken that respondent no.1 was not driving Dumper/Tipper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635 at moderate speed and so the Dumper turned turtle in middle of the road, even then the accident could have been avoided by PW10 Pawan Kumar by applying brakes, but he could not control his bus as he was driving in a rash and negligent manner and at high speed and his bus dashed against the Dumper/Tipper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635. Ld. counsel further submitted that all injured witnesses have wrongly deposed that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and these witnesses can not be believed as they have wrongly deposed the facts only in order to support the case of College authorities and to support PW10, so that College be not held liable to pay compensation. Ld. counsel further submitted that PW10 Pawan Kumar appeared as PW16 in criminal case titled as State versus Rohit and admitted that driver of the Tipper/Dumper had not received any injury in the accident and driver side of said Tipper was not damaged, so entire version of claimants and PW10 that it was head-on-collision between Bus and truck, is not believable. Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 further submitted that even if it is taken that respondent no.1 was also responsible for the accident, even then this case is of contributory negligence. 27. Ld. counsel for respondents no.4 to 6 supported the case of claimants and submitted that only respondent no.1 was responsible for the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 37 accident as he was driving vehicle no.HR37C/8653 in a rash and negligent manner. Ld. counsel further submitted that there is no evidence on record, from which it can be held that it is a case of contributory negligence and Pawan Kumar driver was also responsible for causing the accident. 28.I have given anxious consideration to the arguments raised by ld. counsel for the parties and have perused record of the case. 29.In this case, thirteen (13) witnesses have been examined on behalf of petitioners and respondent no.1 Rohit appeared as RW1. Statements of PW1 to PW3, PW7, PW11 and PW13 are not relevant for decision of Issue no.1. 30.This Tribunal is of the view that once drivers of both vehicles have appeared in the witness box i.e. Pawan Kumar/respondent no.4 as PW10 and Rohit Kumar/respondent no.1 as RW1, then statements of other injured witnesses are not so relevant as the drivers would be the best witnesses to make statement about manner, in which accident occurred. Otherwise also, there are vital contradictions om material points in statements of other eye-witness/injured witnesses i.e. PW4 to PW7, PW8, PW9 and PW12. 31.Pawan Kumar/respondent no.4 was driving College Bus bearing registration no.HR68A/2180 on the date of accident and he appeared as PW10. He filed affidavit Ex.PW10/A, wherein he deposed about the accident to the effect that on 31.3.2015, he alongwith students and staff was going from Ambala Cantt. to SDDI Global College and AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 38 SRM Institute of Technology at village Bhurewala, while driving College Bus no.HR68A/2180 at moderate speed on left side of the road and around 7.30/8.00 AM when reached in the area of village Rajpura on Saha Road, offending Dumper/Tipper no.HR37C/8635 being driven by respondent no.1 at very fast speed and in rash and negligent manner, came from opposite side and upon this he lowered down the speed of his Bus and came on extreme left side of the road, but said Dumper came on wrong side of the road and struck against the Bus, resultantly, all passengers in the Bus received multiple and grievous injuries. He further deposed that due to this accident, Aamir Furqan, Vipin wife of Sahil, Parminder Singh, Manish Kumar, Kesar Singh, Ankit Gupta and Deepak Sharma died at the spot. In his cross-examination, he admitted that driver side of Tipper struck against driver side of his Bus and sand/soil entered the Bus from front wind screen as both winds screens of the Bus had broken. So PW10 has admitted in his cross-examination that both wind screens of his Bus had broken and soil/sand came inside the bus. 32.Pawan Kumar (appeared as PW10 in this case), who was driving the Bus in question, appeared as PW16 in criminal case titled as 'State versus Rohit' pertaining to FIR no.41 dated 31.3.2014 registered for commission of offences punishable u/Ss.279, 337, 338, 304 IPC in Police Station Shahzadpur in regard to the accident in question and in his statement dated 16.2.2016 Ex.P41, he deposed that soil of the Tipper entered the Bus when Bus came in contact with the Tipper and stated that AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 39 it was a head-on-collision. He admitted that photographs attached with the file are the same photographs, which were taken after the accident. He further admitted that driver of the Tipper had not received any injury in said accident and driver side of the Tipper had not damaged in the accident. 33.The statement of RW1 is most relevant and he deposed that on 31.3.2015, he was driving Tipper no.HR37C/8635 on correct side of the road at moderate speed and when reached T-point Rajpura, a tractor trolley came on the road and took sudden turn from the T-point, on which he applied sudden brakes, due to which his Tipper turned sideways and when it was lying on the road, the College Bus no.HR68A/2180 came from opposite side rashly and negligently at high speed and dashed against the Tipper from back side, resultantly, the mud lying in the goods wagon of the Tipper entered the Bus from its windscreen and front windows, as a result thereof the mishap took place. 34.It is clear from statement of RW1 that he had not received any injury in said accident. In his cross-examination he deposed that driver of the Bus was driving his Bus in a rash and negligent manner at high speed and could not control his Bus on seeing the over-turned Tipper. He further deposed that said accident could have been avoided by bus driver, if he had controlled the same. It is admitted fact that respondent no.1 had not suffered any injury and it is not the case of claimants or respondent no.4 that any other occupant of the Tipper had suffered injuries in the accident. AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 40 35.PW5 Amit Saini filed his affidavit Ex.PW5/A and in his cross-examination deposed that driver side of the Bus struck against the conductor side of the truck and both drivers suffered injuries. However his statement is totally contradictory to statements of other witnesses and against record. It is matter of record that driver of Tipper had not suffered any injury. It is also very relevant to mention here that while appearing as PW11 in criminal case, PW Amit Saini deposed that there was T-point at the place of accident and Tipper was carrying mud. He further deposed that mud of the Tipper pumped in the Bus, when Bus came in contact with the Tipper and due to entering of mud, there occurred suffocation and many persons died. 36.PW12 Vivek Sharma deposed that accident occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Tipper driver and police had recorded his statement, wherein he had made same statement regarding cause of accident. But while appearing as PW15 in criminal case titled as State versus Rohit, Vivek Sharma deposed that he does not know as to how said accident occurred. He deposed that he had not made any statement to police. He denied the suggestion that said Tipper was being driven in a rash and negligent manner. He further denied the suggestion that said accident occurred due to negligence of accused. Considering above facts, this Tribunal is of the view that PW12 is not a reliable witness as he has changed his stand from one Court to other. 37.PW8 Ajay Kumar (in present case) appeared as PW10 in criminal case and deposed that he had not seen the driver of Tipper at the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 41 spot. He deposed that only left side of the Tipper was damaged. This Tribunal is of the view that he is not a reliable witness and can not be believed on the point of cause of accident, as being employee of the College, his interest is to avoid liability of the College. While appearing as PW8, he deposed that he was sitting on front seat i.e. conductor seat of the Bus. If he is believed, then version of respondent no.1 is also true that Bus dashed against the Tipper when same had already turned turtle on the road and so PW8 Ajay Kumar has rightly deposed before other Court that he had not seen driver of the Tipper at the spot. 38.It is matter of record that most of the other injured persons, who were travelling in the Bus on that day, while appearing as witnesses in the criminal case titled as State versus Rohit Kumar, admitted that there was curve near the place of occurrence and when driver of Tipper applied brakes, the Tipper turned turtle on the road and they deposed that can not identify driver of the Tipper. They admitted that Bus had entered the mud of the Tipper. 39.After considering the statement dated 16.2.2016 Ex.P41 of Pawan Kumar, this Tribunal is of the view that version of PW10 Pawan Kumar is not believable, as had it been a case of head-on-collision, the driver side of the Tipper would have damaged totally as impact of the accident was such that many persons travelling in the Bus died and other occupants of the Bus suffered grievous injuries. The case file of criminal case titled as “State versus Rohit” was also summoned at the time of arguments in this case and photographs of Tipper bearing registration AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 42 no.HR37C/8635 are on that judicial file, from which it is apparent that driver side of the Tipper even did not hit the Bus and so version of claimants specifically PW10 (driver of bus) regarding head-on-collision is totally false. The photographs on record of criminal case file speak otherwise and substantiate the arguments raised by ld. counsel for respondents no.1 to 3. 40.Sudden crossing of the road by a human being or a child; sudden presence of a stray animal on the road; bursting of tyre due to some alien sharp edge article lying on the road; sudden collapse of the bridge; fall of electric wires; tornado; storm; flush of rain water from cloud burst, etc. are a few illustrative circumstances in which driver of a vehicle can possibly lose control. In any such like sudden events, the drive would try to control the vehicle and may apply sudden brakes, which, instead of stopping the vehicle, may over turn it or cause slip thereby the vehicle might go out of the driver's control. Such kind of accident, happening of which is beyond the control of a driver, may be termed as an “act of God”. However, where the vehicle was in sound roadworthy condition and was driven with an ordinary care, it shall always be expected that it will not go out of control of the driver, yet if any such thing happens, heavy onus shall lie upon either the driver or the owner of the vehicle to divulge that special knowledge of the relevant facts to explain as to why and how the vehicle went out of control of the driver. In the absence of any such explanation, the maxim ' res ipsa loquitur' would undoubtedly be attracted, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 43 Court in Krishna Bus Service Ltd. vs. Smt. Mangli and others AIR 1976 SC 700. 41.The site plan prepared by police after the accident is on record as Ex.P40, from which it is clear that there was a curve near the place of accident and so the version of RW1 Rohit Kumar is believable that in order to avoid the accident with tractor, he had applied brakes and the tractor turned turtle. However, considering the fact that he was also driving at very high speed and that had he been driving at moderate speed, he could have controlled the vehicle. The principle of res ipsa loquitur applies to this case and it can be safely concluded that respondent no.4 was also responsible and had contributed in causing the accident. It is a clear cut case of contributory negligence. From photographs on record, it is apparent that the sand/soil entered the Bus up to about six feet from front of the Bus and it speaks about the speed, at which respondent no.1 was driving the Bus. 42.The claimants and their witnesses had tried their best to prove that it was head-on-collision and respondent no.1 was responsible for the accident. However after perusing entire record and statements of witnesses in criminal case titled as 'State versus Rohit', it is clear that there was a curve near the place of accident and somehow on applying brakes, the Tipper turned turtle on the road, which shows that respondent no.1 was driving the Tipper at high speed and had he been driving at moderate speed, he could have controlled his vehicle, but failed to do so. But on the other hand, it is also clear that respondent no.4 Pawan Kumar AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 44 was driving the Bus at such a high speed that mud loaded in the Tipper entered the Bus, as clear from admissions made by the witnesses and photographs clicked after the accident, which are on record of criminal case file. The quantity of sand/soil entered the Bus was so much that the occupants of the Bus felt suffocated and this suffocation was also the result of some deaths. Had respondent no.4 been driving the College Bus at moderate speed and in a careful manner, even if the Tipper had turned turtle in front of the Bus, the accident could have been avoided. So this can be safely concluded that respondent no.4 Pawan Kumar, driver of the Bus, was also responsible in causing of the accident and so accident was the result of negligence on the part of respondent no.1 (Rohit Kumar) and respondent no.4 (Pawan Kumar) and it is a case of contributory negligence. Both drivers were equally responsible for the accident. 43.After considering the entire evidence on record, it is held that claimed have successfully proved that Aman Sharma, Ajay Kumar, Pritam Singh, Yogesh, Pawan, Vivek and Amit Saini had suffered injuries in the accident in dispute and Deepak Sharma, Parminder Singh, Aamir Furqan and Manish Kumar died due to the injuries suffered in the accident in question. 44.After considering entire evidence on record and keeping in view the above discussion, it is held that accident was not the result of rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 only, but respondent no.4 had also contributed in causing of the accident and both drivers were equally responsible in causing the accident on that day. It is a case of AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 45 contributory negligence. Issue no.1 is decided accordingly. ISSUE NO.2: MACP No.208 of 2015 Aman Sharma vs. Rohit & others 45.In this petition, compensation has been claimed by claimant on account of injuries suffered by her. In the petition, claimant has claimed compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the accident. It has been pleaded that claimant suffered multiple, serious and grievous injuries including multiple fractures in right ankle and foot and that after the accident, she was shifted to Civil Hospital Ambala Cantt. She pleaded that she remained under treatment of private doctors and remained admitted as an indoor patient for many days and spent Rs.1,00,000/- on her treatment, transportation and special diet. 46.Claimant Aman Sharma appeared as PW6 and filed her affidavit Ex.PW6/A, wherein she reiterated the contents of petition regarding suffering of injuries, fractures suffered and shifting to Civil Hospital. She deposed that she spent Rs.1,00,000/- on treatment, medicines, instruments, transportation and special diet. She further deposed that she was 24 years of age and was employed as Lab Technician in Electronics and Communication Branch, S.D.D.I. Global College, village Bhurewala, District Ambala and was getting Rs.7,000/- per month. She further deposed that after said accident, she is not in a position to perform her daily routine and has become permanently disabled and is still under treatment. In cross examination, she deposed AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 46 that she has not brought any proof regarding injuries suffered by her, treatment, medical expenses and her income. 47.To substantiate her claim regarding her disability and injuries suffered in the accident, she has placed on record MLR Ex.P43 and Disability Certificate, issued by Medical Board of three doctors of General Hospital, Ambala City, as Ex.P44. From the MLR Ex.P43, it is clear that she suffered one injury i.e. on leg below knee joint. Due to fracture, she was operated upon and due to the injuries suffered, she suffered permanent disability. As per Disability Certificate Ex.P44, petitioner suffered disability to the extent of 5%. In view of the fact that she suffered permanent disability to the extent of 5%, Rs.10,000/- is awarded under the head of permanent disability. 48.Neither prescription slips nor any Bill showing purchase of medicines has been placed on record by the claimant to substantiate her claim regarding amount spent on treatment. Considering the nature of injuries suffered by petitioner and facts of the case, Rs.30,000/- is awarded in lump sum under the head of pain and suffering, special diet, transportation, attendant charges and loss of income. So, in total, Rs.40,000/- is awarded to claimant as compensation in this case. MACP No.209 of 2015 Manju vs. Rohit & others 49.This claim petition has been filed by petitioners claiming compensation on account of death of Deepak Sharma in the accident in question. Manju, mother of Deepak Sharma (now deceased) appeared as AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 47 PW2 and filed her affidavit Ex.PW2/A, wherein she deposed that her son Deepak Sharma was 27 years of age at the time of his death and was hale and hearty. She further deposed that he was employed as Lecturer of Mechanical Engineering in SRM College, village Bhurewala, District Ambala with management of Shree Ram Mulkh Institute of Engineering and Technology, village Bhurewala, District Ambala and was getting salary of Rs.25,000/- per month and was also taking tuition, thereby earning Rs.10,000/- per month. She further deposed that Rs.One lac was spent on transportation and last rites of deceased. She further deposed that the deceased being their only son, they suffered great loss of love and affection on account of his untimely death. 50.PW13 Amarjit appeared with record regarding employment and salary of deceased Deepak Sharma. He deposed that Deepak Sharma was working in Maha Prabhu Ram Mulkh HI-Tech Education Society as Lecturer at salary of Rs.21,600/- per month. He proved Salary Certificate Ex.P7, Appointment letter Ex.P8, Joining letter Ex.P9 and Attendance Register Ex.P10. In cross-examination, he deposed that as per Ex.P9, he joined as Lecturer Mechanical. 51.No evidence has been lead to probe income from any other source viz tuition etc. From the statement of PW13, it is clear that Deepak Sharma was not a regular employee and was only a Guest Lecturer against salary of Rs.21,600/- per month. Accordingly, his income is assessed as Rs.21,600/- per month. In this petition, claimants are parents of deceased. In this petition, claimants are parents of deceased Deepak Sharma. The AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 48 deceased was unmarried son of claimants and so half of monthly income assessed is to be deducted towards personal expenses of deceased. Accordingly, loss of dependency comes to Rs.10,800/- per month and Rs.1,29,600/- per annum. 52.In view of the law laid down in the case of Munna Lal Jain v. Vipin Kumar Sharma, 2015 AIR SCW 3105, age of the deceased is relevant for selection of multiplier, which is to be used while assessing compensation on account where parents are the claimants. On applying multiplier of '17', amount of compensation to be awarded under the head of loss of dependency comes to Rs.22,03,200/-. Rs.1,00,000/- each is awarded in favour of claimants under the head of loss of love and affection and Rs.25,000/- is awarded under the head of last rites. Accordingly, total compensation of Rs.24,28,200/- is awarded in favour of petitioners. The petitioners will get equal share out of the compensation awarded in this case. MACP No.210 of 2015 Ajay Kumar vs. Rohit & others 53.In this petition, compensation has been claimed by claimant on account of injuries suffered by him.

He suffered fracture of left tibia and fracture of femur. It is clear from Ex.P113 i.e. Discharge Card of Civil Hospital Ambala Cantt. that after first aid, he was referred to PGI, Chandigarh for further treatment. The medical bills are on record as Ex.P115 to Ex.P137 and this Tribunal is of the view that same are genuine and there is no reason to disbelieve the bills Ex.P115 to Ex.P137. In view of above facts, Rs.46,393/- (as shown in Ex.P115 to Ex.P137) is awarded AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 50 under the head of medical bills and hospitalization charges. 56.In addition to the amount awarded above, Rs.10,000/- is awarded under the head of pain and suffering, Rs.5200/- is awarded under the head of transportation (as shown in Ex.P138 to Ex.P141), Rs.5000/- under the head of attendant charges, Rs.5000/- under the head of special diet and Rs.15,000/- under the head of loss of income.

He proved Salary Certificate Ex.P3, Appointment letter Ex.P4, Joining letter Ex.P5 and Attendance Register Ex.P6. In cross-examination, he deposed that as per Ex.P5, he joined as an Assistant Professor. 59.Considering the statement of PW13, it is clear that Parminder Singh was not a regular employee and was only a Guest Lecturer against salary of Rs.24,000/- per month. Accordingly, his salary is assessed as Rs.24,000/- per month. In this petition, claimant no.1 is widow, claimant no.2 is minor son, claimant no.3 is mother and claimant no.4 is father, of the deceased. 60.Considering the fact that there are four claimants, 1/4th of the assessed monthly income is to be deducted towards personal expenses and on deduction of 1/4th, loss of dependency comes to Rs.18,000/- per month and Rs.2,16,000/- per annum. At the time of death, age of deceased was 32 years as per claimants, so multiplier of 16 is to be applied in this case in view of the law laid down in the case of Sarla Verma versus DTC 2009 (6) SCC 121 and on applying of 16, total loss of dependency comes to Rs.34,56,000/-.

My issue-wise findings are as under:- Issue No. 1 10To prove this issue, Bachan Sigh, CW3 has deposed way of affidavit as Ex.CW3/A tendered in his examination-in-chief. He has deposed that, on 15.02.2015 had gone to Shahbad on his motorcycle bearing registration no.HR-01-S-0725 for personal work and after finishing work was returning back to Ambala Cantt. He has further deposed that at about 6.30 p.m. when he stopped at Sharma petrol pump, Kuldeep Nagar for taking petrol and after taking petrol when he started his journey, he saw a white coloured Maruti Zen Estilo car bearing registration no.PB-08-BV-3951 came at very high speed without blowing horn and hit against a motorcycle from behind and front wheel of conductor side of car entangled with the motorcycle and the motorcycle was dragged to a distance of about 50 yards and front tyre of the car also burst. He has further deposed that police had come on the spot and shifted Vimal Kumar (since deceased) to Civil Hospital in ambulance. He has further deposed that lateron name of driver of car was revealed as Ajay son of Ved Parkash, resident of Jalandhar. During cross- examination, he has admitted that he knew Vimal Kumar (since HEMA SHARMA & OTHERS VERSUS AJAY KHURANA & OTHERS -7- deceased) as they live in the same colony. He has denied that he was not present at Sharma petrol pump on 15.02.2015 at about 6.30 p.m. He has further deposed that he himself had seen the accident as Maruti Zen car had hit against a motorcycle. He has further denied that Vimal Kumar (since deceased) was driving his motorcycle in a zig zag manner and was hit by some unknown vehicle. Ms. Anita Kumari, CW4 has proved FIR, order framing charge and challan filed against the accused as Ex.C16 to as Ex.C18 respectively. She has further deposed that case titled “State versus Ajay Khurana” bearing FIR no.27 dated 15.02.2015 under Sections 279/304-A IPC, Police Station Parao, Ambala Cantt. is fixed for prosecution evidence on 14.08.2015. Manish Sharma, CW1 has deposed that FIR no.27 dated 15.02.2015 under Sections 279/304-A IPC was registered in Police Station Parao, on his statement; though during cross-examination he has admitted that he is not witness to the accident. Ajay Khurana, the respondent no.1 did not step into the witness-box to rebut the evidence led by claimants. Learned counsel for the claimants has relied upon Raju & others Versus Sukhwinder Singh & others, 2007(III) ACC page 254, wherein Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that, “ driver of truck did not enter witness box to deny allegations of witness regarding his involvement in accident; adverse inference can be drawn against him. Further it is absolutely necessary to have the first hand report from the driver. It may be that the driver does not always speak the truth, but the driver's version is the one which is to HEMA SHARMA & OTHERS VERSUS AJAY KHURANA & OTHERS -8- be given the best consideration. He only knows as to what actually happened. Therefore, the driver having not been examined, necessarily, an adverse inference arises against him ”. Learned counsel for the petitioner has urged that, factum of registration of FIR no.27 dated 15.02.2015 under Sections 279/304-A IPC with Police Station Parao, Ambala Cantt. as Ex.C16, coupled with challan/report under section 173 CrPC as Ex.C18 filed against accused Ajay Kumar, the driver of car bearing registration no.PB-080BV-3951, order dated 08.06.2015 framing charge against accused Ajay Kumar under Sections 279/304-A IPC as Ex.C17 and testimony of Ms.Anita Kumar, CW4 are sufficient to arrive at the conclusion that, the accident in question causing death of Vimal Kumar had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of Maruti Zen Estilo car bearing registration no.PB-08-BV-3951 by Ajay Khurana, the respondent no.1. Learned counsel for the claimants has also placed reliance upon Gurdeep Kaur Versus Tarsem Singh 2008(2) RCR (Civil) page 775 wherein Hon' ble Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that “ if the driver is being tried on account of rash and negligent driving in a criminal case in a court of law, it is prima facie safe to hold that the accident occurred on account of his rash and negligent act. It is further held that in a claim petition under Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, the evidence should not be scrutinized in the manner as is done in a civil or in a criminal case. The proceedings before the Tribunal are of the nature of summary enquiry, whereas in a criminal case, the rule is of proof HEMA SHARMA & OTHERS VERSUS AJAY KHURANA & OTHERS -9- beyond reasonable doubt and in a civil case, the rule is of preponderance of probabilities. If there is some evidence before the claim Tribunal to prove a fact, no nicety, doubt or suspicion should weigh with it, in deciding a Motor Accident Claim case. It is further held that Tribunals established under the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 are not governed by the rules of procedure envisaged by the Civil Procedure Code and Tribunals are required to evolve their own procedure to meet the ends of justice, based on the principles of justice, equity and good conscience” . It is also held in Bimla Devi Versus Himachal Road Transport Corpn. And others AIR 2009 SC 2819 that “ it is not possible to give strict proof of accident by the claimants and they have to establish their case merely on touchstone of preponderance of probability”. The death of Vimal Kumar stands proved from the death report as Ex.C20 placed on record. 11In view of the above discussion, it is proved that death of Vimal Kumar had occurred on account of the injuries sustained by him in the accident in question, that had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of Maruti Zen Estilo car bearing registration no.PB- 08-BV-3951 by Ajay Khurana, the respondent no.1. Consequently, this issue is decided in favour of claimants and against the respondents. Issue no. 2 12To prove this issue, Hema Sharma, CW2, the petitioner no.1, has deposed by way of affidavit, as Ex.CW2/A tendered in her HEMA SHARMA & OTHERS VERSUS AJAY KHURANA & OTHERS -10- examination-in-chief, reiterating contents of the petition. She has deposed that, Vimal Kumar (since deceased) her husband was employed with M/s Scorpion Express Pvt. Limited as Senior Executive(Accounts) and was getting about Rs.40,000/- per month as salary. During cross- examination, she has deposed that salary of her husband used to be deposited directly in the bank. She has further deposed that her brother-in- law Munish is given compassionate appointment in place of her husband due to his death. She has further deposed that her husband Vimal Kumar (since deceased) was on probation period of six months in the abovesaid firm. Neeraj Yadav, CW5, the Hub Manager, Scorpion Express Private Limited has deposed that late Vimal Kumar was employed in their company. He has further deposed that documents as Ex.C2, as Ex.C4 and marked-5 have been issued by official of their company. He has further deposed that document marked-5 is an annexure to the appointment letter. Hema Sharma, CW2, the petitioner no.1 has claimed income of Vimal Kumar (since deceased), her husband to be Rs.40,000/- per month; however from perusal of annexure marked-5, it can be ascertained that his gross salary is Rs.16,640/- per month. The accident in question is dated 15.02.2015 and Vimal Kumar son of Jayant Kumar was working in M/s Scorpion Express Private Limited since January 2015 as is evident from character certificate as Ex.C3; meaning thereby, he had worked in the said concern only for a period of one and half month. Learned counsel for the petitioners has drawn attention of this court to the document as HEMA SHARMA & OTHERS VERSUS AJAY KHURANA & OTHERS -11- Ex.C4 to show that a sum of Rs.50,000/- per annum as bonus and Rs.2500/- per quarter as incentive was also being paid to Vimal Kumar (since deceased); however, same is not being taken into consideration because Vimal Kumar (since deceased) had worked in the said company only for one and half month so far; therefore, claim qua bonus and incentive does not appear to be genuine. Learned counsel for the petitioners has also relied upon Sarla Verma and others Versus Delhi Transport Corporation and another 2009(6) SCC 121 (SC), Rajesh and others Versus Rajbir Singh and others 2013(9) Supreme Court Cases 54(S.C.), Smt.Manju Devi & Another Versus Sri Gautam & Another, MAC APP. No.489/2009 decided on 18.11.2010 by Hon'ble Delhi High Court, Santosh Devi Versus National Insurance Company Ltd. & Others Civil Appeal no.3723 of 2012 (arising out of SLP(C) No.24489 of 2010) decided on 23.04.2012 by Hon`ble Supreme Court to show that while computing compensation 50% of actual salary/income of the deceased is required to be added towards future prospects; how - ever the said argument is liable to be rejected for the reasons that job of Vimal Kumar (since deceased) cannot be said to be permanent in nature particularly when he was still serving on probation and prior to it was serving in Partap Spintex limited, as is evident from the document marked-6. It is also held in Smt.Savita and others Versus Satpal and others 2015(4) PLR 854 by Hon`ble Punjab and Haryana High Court that, “matter regarding future prospects has been referred to Larger HEMA SHARMA & OTHERS VERSUS AJAY KHURANA & OTHERS -12- Bench of Hon`ble Supreme Court; therefore, it would not be advisable to grant the same now because in case a divergent view is received from the Hon`ble Supreme Court later on, it would not be possible for the insurance company to make recovery .” In the said citation, Munna Lal Jain Vs. Vipin Kumar Sharma (2015-3)179 PLR 304(SC), Rajesh Vs. Rajbir Singh and others (2014-1) 173 PLR 779(SC) and National In- surance Co. Ltd. Vs. Pushpa and others, SLP 8058 of 2014 decided on 02.07.2014 have also been referred. It will be apt to mention here that Vimal Kumar (since deceased) was MBA and thus, his monthly income is taken as Rs.16,640/-. As Vimal Kumar ( since deceased) was married having wife, two minor children and old aged mother to maintain; therefore, he must not be spending more than 1/3rd of his income towards his own personal and living expenses and remaining 2/3rd must be contributing towards his family. Reference can be made to Sarla Verma and others Versus Delhi Transport Corporation and another(supra). Thus, annual dependency comes to Rs.11,094/- x 12 = Rs.1,33,128/-. Vimal Kumar (since deceased) was 32 years of age at the time of his death, as has been mentioned in the death report as Ex.C20; hence in this case the suitable multiplier will be of 16. Thus, on calculating compensation on its basis, it comes to Rs.1,33,128/- x 16 = Rs.21,30,048/-. Further, a sum of Rs.20,000/- on account of transportation, funeral and last rites expenses of the deceased and a sum of Rs.20,000/- on account of loss of consortium are also awarded as HEMA SHARMA & OTHERS VERSUS AJAY KHURANA & OTHERS -13- compensation to Hema Sharma, the claimant no.1. Accordingly, this is - sue is decided in favour of claimants and against respondents . Issue no. 3. 13Onus to prove this issue was on the insurance company, the respondent no.3; however, respondent no.3 did not lead any evidence to show that vehicle in question i.e. Maruti Zen Estilo car bearing registration no.PB-08-BV-3951 was being driven in violation of terms and conditions of insurance policy, as Ex.R3, valid from 09.05.2014 to 08.05.2015. Moreover, learned counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 has tendered copy of registration certificate as Ex.R1, driving licence as Ex.R2 of respondent no.1 bearing no.PB-0820010074362 issued on 10.05.2001 by licensing authority Jalandhar (Punjab) authorizing to drive MCWG/LMV valid till (non-transport) 09.05.2021, insurance policy as Ex.R3 valid from 09.05.2014 to 08.05.2015; hence, under these circumstances, the respondent no.3 has failed to discharge its onus. Accordingly, this issue is decided against respondent no.3 and in favour of the claimant. Issue no.4 (Relief) 14In view of the discussion made above, the present claim petition is partly allowed with costs and a sum of Rs. 21,70,048/- in all is awarded as compensation to the claimants. Out of total amount of HEMA SHARMA & OTHERS VERSUS AJAY KHURANA & OTHERS -14- compensation i.e. Rs.21,70,048/-, a sum of Rs.20,000/- on account of transportation, funeral, last rites expenses of the deceased and a sum of Rs.20,000/- on account of loss of consortium shall be payable exclusively to Smt. Hema Sharma, the claimant no.1. Out of remaining amount of compensation i.e. a sum of Rs.21,30,048/-, a sum of Rs.4,00,000/- lac each shall be payable to Deeksha and Ridima, the claimants no.2 and 3; a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- shall be payable to Smt.Parwati Devi, the claimant no.4 and remaining amount of Rs.11,30,048/- shall be payable to Smt.Hema Sharma, the claimant no.2. Out of the share of claimant no.1, 50% shall be payable to her in cash and remaining 50% shall be deposited in her name in maximum interest bearing fixed deposit scheme for a period of five years in a nationalised bank; whereas the amount of share of Parwati Devi, the claimant no.4 shall be payable to her in cash; however, the share of Deeksha and Ridimi , the minor claimants no.2 and 3, shall be deposited in their names in maximum interest bearing fixed deposit scheme in a nationalised bank till they attain majority . The claimants are also held entitled to interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing the claim petition till realization. As has already been held above, the accident in question had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of Maruti Zen Estilo car bearing registration no.PB- 08-BV-3951 by its driver; hence, Ajay Khurana, the respondent no.1 being driver, Gulshan Rani, the respondent no.2 being owner and the National Insurance Company Limited, the respondent no.3, being insurer HEMA SHARMA & OTHERS VERSUS AJAY KHURANA & OTHERS -15- of Maruti Zen Estilo car bearing registration no.PB-08-BV-3951 shall be liable jointly and severally to pay the compensation to the claimant- petitioners. In order to facilitate the easy release of the amount to the claimants that too without intervention of the court, as per the directions of Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in FAO No. 465 of 2010 (O&M), it is ordered that the insurance company will deposit the amount directly in the name of the claimants, either by way of account payee cheque or demand draft in the tribunal, which shall be released to the claimants on proper identification. The claimants will submit the details of their bank account directly to the insurance company under intimation to this court and the cheques shall be released to the claimants on an application for release of cheque/draft alongwith payment order in the name of concerned Manager with directions to disburse the amount as per the details mentioned in payment order and send a compliance report, which should be made part of the main file and to check the strict compliance, a note be also given on the back side of the cheque or draft that the payment be made as per the details mentioned in the payment order. It is also ordered that the amount due on maturity of the FDRs of claimants no.2 and 3 should be paid to them directly by the concerned bank without the intervention of the court and the case number will be specified on the FDRs alongwith a complete note. The Ahlmad is directed to issue necessary instructions at the relevant time. HEMA SHARMA & OTHERS VERSUS AJAY KHURANA & OTHERS -16- 15Counsel's fee is assessed at Rs.2200/-. Memo of cost be prepared.

Ld. counsel further submitted that last control was in hands of PW10 and had he been driving his bus at moderate speed, the accident could have been avoided. 26.Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 Shri Mohinder Bindal AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 36 Advocate supported the arguments raised by ld. counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 and submitted that even if it is taken that respondent no.1 was not driving Dumper/Tipper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635 at moderate speed and so the Dumper turned turtle in middle of the road, even then the accident could have been avoided by PW10 Pawan Kumar by applying brakes, but he could not control his bus as he was driving in a rash and negligent manner and at high speed and his bus dashed against the Dumper/Tipper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635. Ld. counsel further submitted that all injured witnesses have wrongly deposed that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and these witnesses can not be believed as they have wrongly deposed the facts only in order to support the case of College authorities and to support PW10, so that College be not held liable to pay compensation. Ld. counsel further submitted that PW10 Pawan Kumar appeared as PW16 in criminal case titled as State versus Rohit and admitted that driver of the Tipper/Dumper had not received any injury in the accident and driver side of said Tipper was not damaged, so entire version of claimants and PW10 that it was head-on-collision between Bus and truck, is not believable. Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 further submitted that even if it is taken that respondent no.1 was also responsible for the accident, even then this case is of contributory negligence. 27. Ld. counsel for respondents no.4 to 6 supported the case of claimants and submitted that only respondent no.1 was responsible for the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 37 accident as he was driving vehicle no.HR37C/8653 in a rash and negligent manner. Ld. counsel further submitted that there is no evidence on record, from which it can be held that it is a case of contributory negligence and Pawan Kumar driver was also responsible for causing the accident. 28.I have given anxious consideration to the arguments raised by ld. counsel for the parties and have perused record of the case. 29.In this case, thirteen (13) witnesses have been examined on behalf of petitioners and respondent no.1 Rohit appeared as RW1. Statements of PW1 to PW3, PW7, PW11 and PW13 are not relevant for decision of Issue no.1. 30.This Tribunal is of the view that once drivers of both vehicles have appeared in the witness box i.e. Pawan Kumar/respondent no.4 as PW10 and Rohit Kumar/respondent no.1 as RW1, then statements of other injured witnesses are not so relevant as the drivers would be the best witnesses to make statement about manner, in which accident occurred. Otherwise also, there are vital contradictions om material points in statements of other eye-witness/injured witnesses i.e. PW4 to PW7, PW8, PW9 and PW12. 31.Pawan Kumar/respondent no.4 was driving College Bus bearing registration no.HR68A/2180 on the date of accident and he appeared as PW10. He filed affidavit Ex.PW10/A, wherein he deposed about the accident to the effect that on 31.3.2015, he alongwith students and staff was going from Ambala Cantt. to SDDI Global College and AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 38 SRM Institute of Technology at village Bhurewala, while driving College Bus no.HR68A/2180 at moderate speed on left side of the road and around 7.30/8.00 AM when reached in the area of village Rajpura on Saha Road, offending Dumper/Tipper no.HR37C/8635 being driven by respondent no.1 at very fast speed and in rash and negligent manner, came from opposite side and upon this he lowered down the speed of his Bus and came on extreme left side of the road, but said Dumper came on wrong side of the road and struck against the Bus, resultantly, all passengers in the Bus received multiple and grievous injuries. He further deposed that due to this accident, Aamir Furqan, Vipin wife of Sahil, Parminder Singh, Manish Kumar, Kesar Singh, Ankit Gupta and Deepak Sharma died at the spot. In his cross-examination, he admitted that driver side of Tipper struck against driver side of his Bus and sand/soil entered the Bus from front wind screen as both winds screens of the Bus had broken. So PW10 has admitted in his cross-examination that both wind screens of his Bus had broken and soil/sand came inside the bus. 32.Pawan Kumar (appeared as PW10 in this case), who was driving the Bus in question, appeared as PW16 in criminal case titled as 'State versus Rohit' pertaining to FIR no.41 dated 31.3.2014 registered for commission of offences punishable u/Ss.279, 337, 338, 304 IPC in Police Station Shahzadpur in regard to the accident in question and in his statement dated 16.2.2016 Ex.P41, he deposed that soil of the Tipper entered the Bus when Bus came in contact with the Tipper and stated that AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 39 it was a head-on-collision. He admitted that photographs attached with the file are the same photographs, which were taken after the accident. He further admitted that driver of the Tipper had not received any injury in said accident and driver side of the Tipper had not damaged in the accident. 33.The statement of RW1 is most relevant and he deposed that on 31.3.2015, he was driving Tipper no.HR37C/8635 on correct side of the road at moderate speed and when reached T-point Rajpura, a tractor trolley came on the road and took sudden turn from the T-point, on which he applied sudden brakes, due to which his Tipper turned sideways and when it was lying on the road, the College Bus no.HR68A/2180 came from opposite side rashly and negligently at high speed and dashed against the Tipper from back side, resultantly, the mud lying in the goods wagon of the Tipper entered the Bus from its windscreen and front windows, as a result thereof the mishap took place. 34.It is clear from statement of RW1 that he had not received any injury in said accident. In his cross-examination he deposed that driver of the Bus was driving his Bus in a rash and negligent manner at high speed and could not control his Bus on seeing the over-turned Tipper. He further deposed that said accident could have been avoided by bus driver, if he had controlled the same. It is admitted fact that respondent no.1 had not suffered any injury and it is not the case of claimants or respondent no.4 that any other occupant of the Tipper had suffered injuries in the accident. AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 40 35.PW5 Amit Saini filed his affidavit Ex.PW5/A and in his cross-examination deposed that driver side of the Bus struck against the conductor side of the truck and both drivers suffered injuries. However his statement is totally contradictory to statements of other witnesses and against record. It is matter of record that driver of Tipper had not suffered any injury. It is also very relevant to mention here that while appearing as PW11 in criminal case, PW Amit Saini deposed that there was T-point at the place of accident and Tipper was carrying mud. He further deposed that mud of the Tipper pumped in the Bus, when Bus came in contact with the Tipper and due to entering of mud, there occurred suffocation and many persons died. 36.PW12 Vivek Sharma deposed that accident occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Tipper driver and police had recorded his statement, wherein he had made same statement regarding cause of accident. But while appearing as PW15 in criminal case titled as State versus Rohit, Vivek Sharma deposed that he does not know as to how said accident occurred. He deposed that he had not made any statement to police. He denied the suggestion that said Tipper was being driven in a rash and negligent manner. He further denied the suggestion that said accident occurred due to negligence of accused. Considering above facts, this Tribunal is of the view that PW12 is not a reliable witness as he has changed his stand from one Court to other. 37.PW8 Ajay Kumar (in present case) appeared as PW10 in criminal case and deposed that he had not seen the driver of Tipper at the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 41 spot. He deposed that only left side of the Tipper was damaged. This Tribunal is of the view that he is not a reliable witness and can not be believed on the point of cause of accident, as being employee of the College, his interest is to avoid liability of the College. While appearing as PW8, he deposed that he was sitting on front seat i.e. conductor seat of the Bus. If he is believed, then version of respondent no.1 is also true that Bus dashed against the Tipper when same had already turned turtle on the road and so PW8 Ajay Kumar has rightly deposed before other Court that he had not seen driver of the Tipper at the spot. 38.It is matter of record that most of the other injured persons, who were travelling in the Bus on that day, while appearing as witnesses in the criminal case titled as State versus Rohit Kumar, admitted that there was curve near the place of occurrence and when driver of Tipper applied brakes, the Tipper turned turtle on the road and they deposed that can not identify driver of the Tipper. They admitted that Bus had entered the mud of the Tipper. 39.After considering the statement dated 16.2.2016 Ex.P41 of Pawan Kumar, this Tribunal is of the view that version of PW10 Pawan Kumar is not believable, as had it been a case of head-on-collision, the driver side of the Tipper would have damaged totally as impact of the accident was such that many persons travelling in the Bus died and other occupants of the Bus suffered grievous injuries. The case file of criminal case titled as “State versus Rohit” was also summoned at the time of arguments in this case and photographs of Tipper bearing registration AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 42 no.HR37C/8635 are on that judicial file, from which it is apparent that driver side of the Tipper even did not hit the Bus and so version of claimants specifically PW10 (driver of bus) regarding head-on-collision is totally false. The photographs on record of criminal case file speak otherwise and substantiate the arguments raised by ld. counsel for respondents no.1 to 3. 40.Sudden crossing of the road by a human being or a child; sudden presence of a stray animal on the road; bursting of tyre due to some alien sharp edge article lying on the road; sudden collapse of the bridge; fall of electric wires; tornado; storm; flush of rain water from cloud burst, etc. are a few illustrative circumstances in which driver of a vehicle can possibly lose control. In any such like sudden events, the drive would try to control the vehicle and may apply sudden brakes, which, instead of stopping the vehicle, may over turn it or cause slip thereby the vehicle might go out of the driver's control. Such kind of accident, happening of which is beyond the control of a driver, may be termed as an “act of God”. However, where the vehicle was in sound roadworthy condition and was driven with an ordinary care, it shall always be expected that it will not go out of control of the driver, yet if any such thing happens, heavy onus shall lie upon either the driver or the owner of the vehicle to divulge that special knowledge of the relevant facts to explain as to why and how the vehicle went out of control of the driver. In the absence of any such explanation, the maxim ' res ipsa loquitur' would undoubtedly be attracted, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 43 Court in Krishna Bus Service Ltd. vs. Smt. Mangli and others AIR 1976 SC 700. 41.The site plan prepared by police after the accident is on record as Ex.P40, from which it is clear that there was a curve near the place of accident and so the version of RW1 Rohit Kumar is believable that in order to avoid the accident with tractor, he had applied brakes and the tractor turned turtle. However, considering the fact that he was also driving at very high speed and that had he been driving at moderate speed, he could have controlled the vehicle. The principle of res ipsa loquitur applies to this case and it can be safely concluded that respondent no.4 was also responsible and had contributed in causing the accident. It is a clear cut case of contributory negligence. From photographs on record, it is apparent that the sand/soil entered the Bus up to about six feet from front of the Bus and it speaks about the speed, at which respondent no.1 was driving the Bus. 42.The claimants and their witnesses had tried their best to prove that it was head-on-collision and respondent no.1 was responsible for the accident. However after perusing entire record and statements of witnesses in criminal case titled as 'State versus Rohit', it is clear that there was a curve near the place of accident and somehow on applying brakes, the Tipper turned turtle on the road, which shows that respondent no.1 was driving the Tipper at high speed and had he been driving at moderate speed, he could have controlled his vehicle, but failed to do so. But on the other hand, it is also clear that respondent no.4 Pawan Kumar AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 44 was driving the Bus at such a high speed that mud loaded in the Tipper entered the Bus, as clear from admissions made by the witnesses and photographs clicked after the accident, which are on record of criminal case file. The quantity of sand/soil entered the Bus was so much that the occupants of the Bus felt suffocated and this suffocation was also the result of some deaths. Had respondent no.4 been driving the College Bus at moderate speed and in a careful manner, even if the Tipper had turned turtle in front of the Bus, the accident could have been avoided. So this can be safely concluded that respondent no.4 Pawan Kumar, driver of the Bus, was also responsible in causing of the accident and so accident was the result of negligence on the part of respondent no.1 (Rohit Kumar) and respondent no.4 (Pawan Kumar) and it is a case of contributory negligence. Both drivers were equally responsible for the accident. 43.After considering the entire evidence on record, it is held that claimed have successfully proved that Aman Sharma, Ajay Kumar, Pritam Singh, Yogesh, Pawan, Vivek and Amit Saini had suffered injuries in the accident in dispute and Deepak Sharma, Parminder Singh, Aamir Furqan and Manish Kumar died due to the injuries suffered in the accident in question. 44.After considering entire evidence on record and keeping in view the above discussion, it is held that accident was not the result of rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 only, but respondent no.4 had also contributed in causing of the accident and both drivers were equally responsible in causing the accident on that day. It is a case of AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 45 contributory negligence. Issue no.1 is decided accordingly. ISSUE NO.2: MACP No.208 of 2015 Aman Sharma vs. Rohit & others 45.In this petition, compensation has been claimed by claimant on account of injuries suffered by her. In the petition, claimant has claimed compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the accident. It has been pleaded that claimant suffered multiple, serious and grievous injuries including multiple fractures in right ankle and foot and that after the accident, she was shifted to Civil Hospital Ambala Cantt. She pleaded that she remained under treatment of private doctors and remained admitted as an indoor patient for many days and spent Rs.1,00,000/- on her treatment, transportation and special diet. 46.Claimant Aman Sharma appeared as PW6 and filed her affidavit Ex.PW6/A, wherein she reiterated the contents of petition regarding suffering of injuries, fractures suffered and shifting to Civil Hospital. She deposed that she spent Rs.1,00,000/- on treatment, medicines, instruments, transportation and special diet.

Global College, village Bhurewala, District Ambala and was getting Rs.7,000/- per month. She further deposed that after said accident, she is not in a position to perform her daily routine and has become permanently disabled and is still under treatment. In cross examination, she deposed AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 46 that she has not brought any proof regarding injuries suffered by her, treatment, medical expenses and her income. 47.To substantiate her claim regarding her disability and injuries suffered in the accident, she has placed on record MLR Ex.P43 and Disability Certificate, issued by Medical Board of three doctors of General Hospital, Ambala City, as Ex.P44. From the MLR Ex.P43, it is clear that she suffered one injury i.e. on leg below knee joint. Due to fracture, she was operated upon and due to the injuries suffered, she suffered permanent disability. As per Disability Certificate Ex.P44, petitioner suffered disability to the extent of 5%. In view of the fact that she suffered permanent disability to the extent of 5%, Rs.10,000/- is awarded under the head of permanent disability. 48.Neither prescription slips nor any Bill showing purchase of medicines has been placed on record by the claimant to substantiate her claim regarding amount spent on treatment. Considering the nature of injuries suffered by petitioner and facts of the case, Rs.30,000/- is awarded in lump sum under the head of pain and suffering, special diet, transportation, attendant charges and loss of income. So, in total, Rs.40,000/- is awarded to claimant as compensation in this case. MACP No.209 of 2015 Manju vs. Rohit & others 49.This claim petition has been filed by petitioners claiming compensation on account of death of Deepak Sharma in the accident in question. Manju, mother of Deepak Sharma (now deceased) appeared as AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 47 PW2 and filed her affidavit Ex.PW2/A, wherein she deposed that her son Deepak Sharma was 27 years of age at the time of his death and was hale and hearty. She further deposed that he was employed as Lecturer of Mechanical Engineering in SRM College, village Bhurewala, District Ambala with management of Shree Ram Mulkh Institute of Engineering and Technology, village Bhurewala, District Ambala and was getting salary of Rs.25,000/- per month and was also taking tuition, thereby earning Rs.10,000/- per month. She further deposed that Rs.One lac was spent on transportation and last rites of deceased. She further deposed that the deceased being their only son, they suffered great loss of love and affection on account of his untimely death. 50.PW13 Amarjit appeared with record regarding employment and salary of deceased Deepak Sharma. He deposed that Deepak Sharma was working in Maha Prabhu Ram Mulkh HI-Tech Education Society as Lecturer at salary of Rs.21,600/- per month. He proved Salary Certificate Ex.P7, Appointment letter Ex.P8, Joining letter Ex.P9 and Attendance Register Ex.P10. In cross-examination, he deposed that as per Ex.P9, he joined as Lecturer Mechanical. 51.No evidence has been lead to probe income from any other source viz tuition etc. From the statement of PW13, it is clear that Deepak Sharma was not a regular employee and was only a Guest Lecturer against salary of Rs.21,600/- per month. Accordingly, his income is assessed as Rs.21,600/- per month. In this petition, claimants are parents of deceased. In this petition, claimants are parents of deceased Deepak Sharma. The AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 48 deceased was unmarried son of claimants and so half of monthly income assessed is to be deducted towards personal expenses of deceased. Accordingly, loss of dependency comes to Rs.10,800/- per month and Rs.1,29,600/- per annum. 52.In view of the law laid down in the case of Munna Lal Jain v. Vipin Kumar Sharma, 2015 AIR SCW 3105, age of the deceased is relevant for selection of multiplier, which is to be used while assessing compensation on account where parents are the claimants. On applying multiplier of '17', amount of compensation to be awarded under the head of loss of dependency comes to Rs.22,03,200/-. Rs.1,00,000/- each is awarded in favour of claimants under the head of loss of love and affection and Rs.25,000/- is awarded under the head of last rites. Accordingly, total compensation of Rs.24,28,200/- is awarded in favour of petitioners. The petitioners will get equal share out of the compensation awarded in this case.

Accordingly, his salary is assessed as Rs.24,000/- per month. In this petition, claimant no.1 is widow, claimant no.2 is minor son, claimant no.3 is mother and claimant no.4 is father, of the deceased. 60.Considering the fact that there are four claimants, 1/4th of the assessed monthly income is to be deducted towards personal expenses and on deduction of 1/4th, loss of dependency comes to Rs.18,000/- per month and Rs.2,16,000/- per annum.

The accident took place due to sole rash and negligence of driver of Offending Truck bearing Registration No. HR-37-A-7707 . SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 4 3The second claim petition reveals the similar facts of accident as already elaborated and so far as her injuries are concerned; it is pleaded that soon after the accident, injured Sahab Singh was taken to General Hospital, Ambala City, from where, he was referred to PGI Chandigarh Cantt, where he remained admitted from 31.10.2014 to 10.11.2014.

On the basis of statement of Sohan Lal, FIR No. 134 dated 31.10.2014 under section 279, 337 of IPC was registered in Police Station, Ismailabad, District Kurukshetra against the respondent No.1. Hence, both claim petitions have been filed with prayer that respondents are liable jointly and severally to pay compensation. 4Notice of these petitions were given to the respondents. The respondent no.1 filed written statement controverting the assertions made in the petitions. He took some preliminary objections like maintainability; claim petitions are bad for non joinder and mis joinder of necessary parties;; that the claimants have no cause of action or locus standi to file the petitions; that the claimants are estopped by their own act and conduct from filing the present petitions. On merit, it has been submitted that no accident had been occurred by the answering respondent with his vehicle on the alleged date, time and place. As a matter of fact, answering respondent and his vehicle have been wrongly implicated in said false FIR SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 5 by the police colluded with the claimants, therefore, the claimants are not entitled to any compensation and no liability can be imposed on answering respondent. Rest of averments made in the petition are denied with a prayer for dismissal of both the claim petition with costs. 5The respondent No. 2 insurance company filed separate written statement controverting the assertions made in the petition and took some preliminary objections regarding maintainability, cause of action; that the claim petitions are hit by the principles of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence; that the petitions are bad for non joinder of necessary parties and mis joinder of parties; that there is no insurable interest between insurer and insured; that the person driving the Truck No. HR- 37-A-7707 was not having a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the accident in violation of the terms and conditions of the alleged insurance policy; that the respondent reserves its right to take all defences and pleas available under section 148, 149 (2), 167,169 and 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and in terms of the insurance policy. On merit, it has been submitted that no record regarding alleged, occupation and income of the claimants has been placed on record. It is denied that claimants suffered serious and grievous injuries due to this accident and they remained admitted in any hospital due to th injuries suffered in the alleged accident and spent such huge amount on their medical treatment, transportation etc. The truck bearing registration No. HR-37-A-7707 was never involved in any accident, however, the insurance particular of the vehicle in question has not been verified from the issuing authority so SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 6 same is not admitted, but the liability of the insurance company, if any, subject to the provisions of the M.V . Act and also terms and conditions thereof. The amount claimed as compensation is much more exaggerated and imaginary one. It is denied that the claimants suffered serious and grievous injuries due to this accident and they remained admitted in any hospital due to the injuries suffered in the alleged accident. The actual cause of alleged accident has been suppressed; as such the answering respondent is not liable in any manner. The claim claimants have been filed after due consultation just to get compensation from the answering respondent on purely made up basis which is not sustainable in the eyes of law, so the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. Rests of facts are denied and prayed for dismissal the petitions with special costs. 6Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following consolidated issues are framed vide order dated 14.05.2015:- 1.Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent of the respondent No.1 while driving Truck bearing Number HR-37-A-7707 resulting into causing injuries to Sohan Lal and Sahab Singh, as alleged?

On the other hand, respondent No.2 tendered copy of insurance policy as Ex.R4 and t heir evidence was closed on 14.01.2016. No rebuttal evidence was led and learned counsel for the claimants closed the rebuttal evidence vide recorded statement dated 14.01.2016. 8I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1 : 9 Under this issue, petitioners- claimants are required to prove the fact that motor vehicular accident was occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Respondent no.1, while driving truck bearing Number HR-37-A-7707, resulting into causing injuries to Sohan Lal and Sahab Singh and as such the claimants are entitled to appropriate compensation from respondents. 10Learned counsel for the petitioners-claimants has argued that since accident in question was taken place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1 resulting causing injuries to Sohan Lal and Sahab Singh and offending vehicle is insured with SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 11 respondent no.2, therefore, respondent No.1 and respondent No.2 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. Learned counsel for claimants has further contended that vehicle in question was very much involved in the alleged accident and insured with respondent no.2. He urged for allowing the instant petition. 11 On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent no.1 has argued that no such accident, as alleged, was ever taken place with the involvement of offending vehicle, rather, False FIR was lodged against the respondent No.1, therefore, no negligence could be attributed to the respondent No.1 and in this view of the matter, no liability could be fastened upon the respondent no.1. He further urged that vehicle was insured with respondent no.2 and so owner of vehicle did not breach any condition of policy, therefore, insurance company has to indemnify the insured and as such both petitions are liable to be dismissed qua respondent no. 1 being devoid of merits. 12 Learned counsel for respondent No.2 has argued that FIR was registered against respondent No.1 only after due manipulation in collusion with each other just to shift undue burden upon the insurance company. He further argued that no accident was taken place with the offending vehicle belonging to respondent No.1, rather, Sohan Lal and Sahab Singh sustained injuries due to the fault of Sahab Singh as he was riding accidental motorcycle carrying three occupants against statutory rules or without caring traffic rules and so if accident is admitted, even then, sahib Singh can not be spared from contributory liability . He further SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 12 argued that respondent no.1 has breached the covenent of policy by non production of route permit and so insurance company is not liable to pay compensation and prayed for dismissal both petitions. 13I have given due regard to the rival contentions put forth by learned counsel for respective parties and have evaluated the entire oral evidence coupled with documentary evidence carefully. After thorough examination, it is observed that the petitioners-claimants have come to this Tribunal with categorical stand that the accident was taken place due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing Number HR-37-A-7707, resulting into causing injuries to Sohan Lal and Sahab Singh . In order to prove factum of accident, PW1 & PW2 {injured/eye witnesses} categorically stated through affidavits with regard to factum of accident, which was occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of truck bearing Number HR-37-A-7707 by respondent No.1. Further PW1 and PW2 being injured tendered affidavit EX.PW1/A and EX.PW2/A supporting the factum of accident. They were cross examined at length, but nothing adverse can be extracted disbelieving the factual position of motor vehicular accident. In this way, statement of PW1, PW2 being injured, can not be doubted from any angle regarding involvement of offending vehicle in the motor vehicular accident, particularly, when their statement are corroborated with documentary evidence like registration of FIR, copy of challan as Ex.P5, copy of charge sheet as Ex.P6; certified copy of site plan as Ex.P7, Mechanical report of Vehicle No. HR-01-P- 3991 as Ex.P8 and mechanical report of HR-37-A-7707 as Ex.P9. It SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 13 would be appropriate to point out here that despite availing opportunities, respondents failed to rebut the testimonies of claimants with regard to involvement of offending vehicle falsely in the said accident. Mere denial of rash and negligence at the behest of respondents after causing accident resulting causing injuries to two occupants of motor cycle, are not found sufficient at all disbelieving the factual position of accident. 14It is quite well settled that the lodging of the first information report is not an essential prerequisite for claiming compensation arising from a motor accident. Each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The Tribunal is expected to adjudge a case on the basis of the evidence produced without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled position of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. It must be remembered that in a motor accident claim, the claimants are not required to prove their case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. It is trite law that claimants-petitioners are required to prove its case, which sets up the particular case relating to the accident which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts upon the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way as alleged by the claimants. The provisions with regard to claim under the Act are enacted keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimants are always entitled for compensation irrespective whether the police has registered SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 14 the offence regarding the incident or not because no claim case can be left over on the mercy of the police. The evidence brought on record irrefutably leads to the inference in terms of unrebutted evidence at the instance of petitioners that there was taken place accident between motor cycle and ambulance van resulting causing injuries to claimants and death of driver of offending vehicle. In this way, it can be held that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of driver of offending vehicle. If rider Sahab Singh was riding motor cycle with two pillion riders against the statutory provision/ traffic rules, then he is liable to face punishment under traffic rules as per law. Accordingly, this issue no.1 is decided in favour of the claimants. ISSUE NO. 2: 15The onus to prove this issue is upon claimants. Learned counsel for claimants has submitted that offending vehicle was owned by respondent no.1 and was insured with respondent no.2, therefore, insurance company is liable to indemnify the insured and prayed for allowing petition. In support to his contention, he has placed reliance upon following authorities; In Arvind Kumar Mishra Vs. New India Assurance Co. Ltd and another, 2010 (4) RCR (Civil) 917 , it has been observed that Motor Accident- How to assess of earnings in respect of a victim who suffered 70% disablement:-Motor Accident due to rash and negligent driving of a truck driver- Claimant suffered 70% permanent disablement (right hand amputated, loss of vision of right eye) Victim was aged 25 years and a SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 15 brilliant student of Engineering with bright carrier- His earnings assessed at Rs.60,000/- per annum payable to Assistant Engineer in public employment- Since he suffered 70% permanent disability the future earnings may be discounted by 30% which came to Rs.42,000/- per annum- The operative multiplier would be 18. The loss of future earnings by multiplying the multiplicand of Rs.42,000/- by a multiplier of 18 comes to Rs.7,56,000/-. A sum of Rs.1.50 lacs awarded toward medical expenses- The total amount of compensation to which the appellant is entitled is Rs.9,06,000. It has been further observed that Award of compensation- Perfect compensation is hardly possible- However, Court must take care to give the victim full and fair compensation for that he had suffered- In some cases for personal injury, the cases for personal injury, the claim could be in respect of life time's earnings lost because, though, he will live, he cannot earn his living- In others, the claim may be made for partial loss of earnings- Each case has to be considered in the light of its own facts and at the end, one must ask whether the sum awarded is a fair and reasonable sum. In Raj Kumar Vs. Ajay Kumar and another, 2011 (1) ACC 1, it has been observed that Quantum injury- Principles of assessment- Determination of loss of future earnings of the injured with reference to extent of his permanent disablement explained- Principles enumerated and illustrations given. Principles are: (i)All injuries for permanent disabilities arising from injuries, SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 16 do not result in loss of earning capacity. (ii)The percentage of permanent disability with reference to the whole body of a person, cannot be assumed to be the percentage of loss of earning capacity. To put it differently, the percentage of loss of earning capacity is not the same as the percentage of permanent disability (except in a few cases, where the Tribunal on the basis of evidence, concludes that percentage of loss of earning capacity is the same as percentage of permanent disability). (iii)The doctor who treated an injured-claimant or who examined him subsequently to assess the extent of his permanent disability can give evidence only in regard to the extent of permanent disability. The loss of earning capacity is something that will have to be assessed by the Tribunal with reference to the evidence in entirety. (iv)The same permanent disability may result in different percentages of loss of earning capacity in different persons, depending upon the nature of profession, occupation or job, age, education and other factors. It has also been observed that Quantum- Injury- Principles of assessment- Personal expenses- Whether one-third or any other percentage may be deducted as personal or living expenses from income of the injured while computing his future loss of earnings- Held: No. In K. Suresh Vs. New India Assurance Co.Ltd. And another, 2012 ACJ 2694 , it has been observed that Quantum- Injury- Principles of assessment- Loss of earning power and permanent disability- Injured sustained injuries resulting in 40 per cent permanent disablement- SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 17 Tribunal awarded Rs.5,00,000 for loss of earning capacity and further Rs.3,00,000 towards permanent disablement-Appellate court allowed Rs.4,68,000 for loss of earning capacity and disallowed compensation for permanent disablement- Whether total deletion of compensation for permanent disablement is justified- Held: no, compensation can be granted under both heads. In Karnail Singh and others Vs. Balwinder Singh and another, 2013 (1) PLR 774 , it has been observed that three persons on a motorcycle having been hit by Maruti car coming from behind- The three persons traveling on a motorcycle may have been guilty of traffic offence but there is no reason for the Court to make any inference regarding negligence as contributory by the only fact that three persons were going on motorcycle. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents No.2 has vehemently argued that although offending vehicle was insured with policy EX.R4 but no route permit has been brought on record. He further argued that injured Sahib Singh was riding motor cycle with two pillion riders as admitted and so he is contributory liable to share as he was also driving the motorcycle in violation of the provisions of Motor Vehicles Act and prayed for dismissal the same. Learned counsel for respondents no.2 has placed reliance upon following case law:- In support to his contentions, learned counsel for respondent No.2 has placed reliance upon case law cited as Angrejo Devi and others Vs. Jai Parkash and Others, 2012 (4) PLR 604, wherein it has been observed that Negligence- Motor cycle is designed to ride two persons, if used by more than two SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 18 persons, then the driver will have to share part of his seat, he will not be able to control the vehicle effectively- Moreover, the weight on account of third passenger will affect its stability- was also driving the motorcycle in violation of the provisions of the M.V Act- Learned Tribunal has rightly come to the conclusion that it was a case of contributory negligence of the deceased in the ratio of 50% each. In Madan Lal Papneja Vs. State of Haryana and others, 2011 (1) PLR 61 , it has been observed that Disability may either be permanent or temporary- For permanent disability- which is capable of ascertainment in terms of percentage of functional disability of the particular organ of the body that is affected, the amount could be Rs.1000/- for every % of permanent disability and Rs.250/- for every % of temporary disability. In Kamala Mangalal Vayani and others Vs. M/s United India Insurance Company Ltd and others, 2010 (2) PLR 687 , it has been observed that Owner and driver proceeded ex parte- Failure of insurance company to prove that the vehicle had no permit- Insurance company held liable- Insured can proceed against the owner and recovering the amount paid by it so the claimants, in the event of the insurer being able to establish, in any suit it may choose to file against the owner, that there was violation or breach of the conditions of the insurance policy or that the vehicle was not covered by a permit on the date of the accident. 16Having due regard to the rival contentions put forth by counsel for the parties, it is observed that rider of motorcycle namely SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 19 Sohan Lal was riding accidental vehicle by violating the statutory provision of law as admitted and therefore this substantial fact can be taken into consideration for breach of traffic rules as per law as held in Karnail Singh and others Vs. Balwinder Singh and another, 2013 (1) PLR 774,. According to evidence, it can be gathered that injured Sohan Lal remained admitted as indoor patient w.e.f.31.10.2104 to 8.12.2014 and he spent total amount of Rs.1,57,211 { In round figure 1,57,300/-} as per medical bills EX.P33-EX.P106. He did not sustain any permanent disability and as such following assessment is made; Pecuniary damages (Special damages) (i).Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization in PGI, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and miscellaneous expenditure.RS.1,57,300/- medical expenses and Rs. 9000/- as indoor patient @ 1000/- per day including all expenses. (ii).Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising: (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment; (b) Loss of future earning on account of injuries etc. 5000/- nil (iii). Future medical expenses. 5000/- None-pecuniary damages (General damages) (iv). Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries. RS. 10 ,000/- (v). Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage). nil (vi).Loss of expectation of life ( shortening of normal longevity). Nil. Total Compensation Rs.,1,86,300/- SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 20 17In this way, petitioner-claimant Sohan Lal is held entitled to comenstaion amounting Rs.1,86,300/- along with interest @ 7.5% per annumfrom the date of filing of petition till realization of awarded amount, which is quite fair, reasonable and just compensation. Rests of relief sought by petitioner-claimant stands declined. 18 So far as second claimant Sahib Singh is concerned; it is evident that said Sahib Singh was hospitalized in PGI for a period from 31.10.2014 to 10.11.2014 as Indoor patient. PW3 Dr. Vikas Paul, proved the disability certificate as Ex.P3 showing his 83% permanent on account of amputation of right thigh and also stated that the disability assessed by the Board is of particular limb only. He relied bills Ex.P10 to Ex.P32 showing total expenses of Rs.52,313/-{ in round figure 52400/-} was being spent on his treatment. According to his version coupled with medical evidence, he suffered 83% physical permanent disability of particular limb and so In view of extent of physical disability and its nature when examined in the light of Judgment in Ram Kiran Goyal vs Sub Divisional engineer, mechanical and other 2008 {2} RCR {Civil}103, the claimant Sahib Singh is held entitled to Rs. 1,66,000/- @ 2,000/- per percent. 19In view of the law settled in Raj Kumar Vs Ajay Kumar, (2011)1 SCC 343 , the petitioner is held entitled to the following compensation: Pecuniary damages (Special damages) SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 21 46 percent permanent Physical injuries to particular limb; Rs. 1,66,000/- (i).Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization in PGI, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and miscellaneous expenditure.Rs.52300/- medical expenses and Rs. 11000/- as indoor patient @ 1000/- per day including all expenses. (ii).Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising: (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment; (b) Loss of future earning on account of injuries etc. 5000/- 50000/- (iii). Future medical expenses. 25000/- None-pecuniary damages (General damages) (iv). Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries. RS. 15 ,000/- (v). Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage). nil (vi).Loss of expectation of life ( shortening of normal longevity). Nil. Total Compensation Rs.,3,24,300/- 20 In this way, petitioner-claimant Sahib Singh is held entitled to comenstaion amounting Rs.3,24,300/- along with interest @ 7.5% per annumfrom the date of filing of petition till realization of awarded amount, which is quite fair, reasonable and just compensation. Rests of relief sought by petitioner-claimant stands declined. ISSUE NO.3 to 5, 7&8 : 21 The onus to prove these issues is upon Respondents but they neither pressed this issue nor led any evidence. However, it has already discussed in detail under Issue No.1 & 2 that accident was occurred due to SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 22 rash ad negligent driving of respondent no.1. In this way, it has become obvious on file that this tribunal has left with no other option except to decide these issues against Respondents. Accordingly, these issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.6: 22 Coming to question of liability where under onus to prove this issue is upon the respondent No.2, who is under the obligation to prove the fact that respondent No.1 was not holding valid driving licence to run offending vehicle at the day of alleged accident and as such he has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. 23However, there is nothing on record to show that respondent No.1, was not holding any valid license, rather same is proved as EX.R2 . Further Insurance Policy Ex.R4 reveals that offending vehicle as per RC EX.R1 in the name of respondent no.1 was insured with the respondent No.2 at the time of accident. The respondent no.1 has also furnished fitness certificate of offending vehicle as EX.R3 and so non production of route permit would not defeat right of respondent no.1 to indemnify the claim by respondent no.2. Resultantly, respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation as such respondent no.2 shall indemnify the claim. Accordingly, this Issue is decided against the respondent No.2. ISSUE NO.9 (RELIEF): BOTH Petitions succeed ; 24 In view of the foregoing discussion, both the claim petition are partly allowed with cost. Claimant-petitioner Sohan Lal is SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 23 entitled to compensation of Rs. 1,86,300/- along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this claim petition till the date of actual payment. The awarded compensation amount along with the interest shall be payable jointly and severally by respondent no. 1 and 2 and respondent no.2 insurance company shall indemnify the insured. In Second claim petition , claimant-petitioner Sahib Singh is entitled to compensation of Rs.3,24,300/- along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this claim petition till the date of actual payment. The awarded compensation amount along with the interest shall be payable jointly and severally by respondent no. 1 and 2 and respondent no.2 insurance company shall indemnify the insured. Remaining relief sought by both claimants stands declined. It is further made clear that 50 percent amount shall be deposited in FDR for three years in any Nationalized bank. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.3000/- each petition. Copy of this award be placed on the connected case file. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly and file be consigned to records after due compliance. Announced in open Court.

Pooja in a Motor Vehicular Accident occurred on 29.03.2015. -.- Present:- Shri Ashok Madan, Counsel for the petitioners-claimants. Shri Sushil Kumar, Counsel for the respondent No.1. Shri V .P.Gupta, Counsel for the respondent No.2. AWARD:- This award shall dispose of aforesaid two claim petitions No.30/MACT of 2015 titled as Sunil Kumar Vs. Raj Kumar & others (hereinafter referred to as “First Petition”); and claim petition No.31/MACT of 2015 titled as Pooja Vs. Raj Kumar & Anr (hereinafter referred to as “Second Petition”). Both the claim petitions have been preferred relating to one accident, for grant of compensation of Rs. 10,00,000/- each on account of injuries suffered by both claimants on account of injuries suffered by them, in a motor vehicular accident occurred on 29.03.2015 at about 1.30 P.M Near Kalpi-Nahoni Road, in the area of P. S. Mullana and a case under section 279, 337 of IPC bearing FIR No. 50 dated 29.03.2015 was registered against respondent No.1. At SUNIL KUMAR VS RAJ KUMAR ETC 3 the relevant time, the vehicle in question was owned by respondent no. 1 and was insured with respondent No.2. 2The necessary facts relating to accident are that on 29.03.2015, first claimant, his wife Pooja and a son Uday were going on Motorcycle bearing Registration No. HR-01-E-0253, being driven by first claimant on extreme left side of the road and at a moderate speed and when he reached near his village on Kalpi-Nahoni road, in the meantime, a Car bearing Registration No.HR-54-B-6959 came from Kalpi side 'being driven by its driver i.e respondent No.1, in rash and negligent manner and hit the motorcycle and due to this impact, first claimant, his wife and a son fell down on the road and sustained injuries. This accident has been occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. So far as medical treatment as well as status/ income of the injured are that after the accident, the injured was immediately shifted to Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt by his brother Jai Kumar from where, they were shifted to C. Lal Hospital, Ambala Cantt. First claimant Sunil Kumar remained admitted in that hospital from 29.03.2015 to 07.04.2015 and spent huge amount on his medical treatment. First claimant is doing a private Job with Coca Cola Company M/s Kandhari Beverages Pvt Ltd, situated at Saha, District Ambala and is getting monthly salary of Rs.10,000/-. The second claim petition reveals the similar facts of accident as already elaborated and so far as her medical treatment & injuries are concerned; it is pleaded that soon after the accident, injured Pooja was SUNIL KUMAR VS RAJ KUMAR ETC 4 taken to Civil Hospital, Ambala from where she was shifted to C. Lal Hospital, Ambala Cantt, where she remained admitted in that hospital from 29.03.2015 to 30.04.2015 and a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- spent on her treatment and she is still under treatment of doctors. She used to contribute her family to the tune of Rs.5000/- per month as she had engaged a female for doing household work at salary of Rs.5,000/-. She has not been fully recovered as yet and is still unable to perform her household works in efficient manner and is incapable to work properly. Hence, both the respondents are equally liable to pay the amount of compensation to the claimants. 3Upon service of these claim petitions, respondent no.1, filed written statement denying the factum of accident and other aspects in the claim petitions. He took some preliminary objections regarding maintainability; concealment of true and material fact and that no accident took place with the alleged car bearing registration No. HR-54-B-6959 on 29.03.2015. On merit, it is submitted that accident in question did not take place with the answering respondent by alleged car bearing registration No. HR-54-B-6959 on 29.3.2015, so the question of sustaining injuries by the claimants does not arise at all. However, alleged injured might have suffered injuries in the accident by some unknown vehicle, which number could not be noted down. The income of the claimant exhibited is much excessive to the knowledge of the claimants themselves. The FIR lodged by the claimants is based on false facts to the knowledge of the claimants themselves. Since alleged car SUNIL KUMAR VS RAJ KUMAR ETC 5 bearing registration No. HR-54-B-6959 is falsely involved in connivance with the police just to get compensation from the answering respondent, to which the claimants are not legally entitled to on the basis of registration of false case, as the accident in question did not take place with the car, as alleged. However, the alleged car of the answering respondent is insured with IFFCO TOKIO General Insurance Company Ltd vide Insurance policy No. 88765652 having insurance policy valid w.e.f 23.02.2015 to 22.02.2016. The amount claimed in the claim petitions is highly exaggerated. Rest of averments made in the petition are denied with a prayer for dismissal of both the claim petitions with costs. 4 Respondent No.2 filed separate written statement denying the factum of accident and other aspects in preliminary objections and on merits. Respondent No.2, took various preliminary objections in total number 13 regarding locus-standi etc. Apart from preliminary objections, on merit, answering respondent denied the accident alleged to have taken place as stated in the claim petitions. It is denied that any accident was caused by the car bearing registration No. HR-54-B-6959 or due to its rash and negligent driving or that the said vehicle was involved in the alleged accident. The First Information Report, if any, is false besides being a manipulated one and an after thought having been lodged after delay. The vehicle in question has been planted falsely in the case in collusion with respondent No.1 and police in order to get claim from insurance company. The accident, if any, was caused by some unknown vehicle and was a “Hit and Run” case. It is further submitted that in case SUNIL KUMAR VS RAJ KUMAR ETC 6 car bearing registration No. HR-54-B-6959 is also proved by the claimants to be involved in the alleged accident, it was all due to some contributory rash and negligent act of the claimant, who was driving the motorcycle rashly and negligently without wearing helmet and having three pillion riders and without caring for the on-coming traffic on the road and without having any valid and effective driving licence. The FIR if any is false and was lodged against the car by the claimant in collusion with respondent No.1 and the police. It is denied that claimants suffered any injury or disablement due to any accident involving the car bearing registration No. HR-54-B-6959 or have received any treatment and spent any amount as alleged. The answering respondent is at present unable to admit the insurance of the car bearing registration No. HR-54-B-6959 for want of insurance particulars. The insurance is therefore denied and respondent No.1 may be directed to produce the original insurance policy. Cover note and/ or particulars of insurance to enable the answering respondent to verify the same and file its detailed amended written statements for which the answering respondent reserve its right. The averments made in both the claim petitions regarding ownership and driver are contradictory to the averments made in other paras and title of the petitions and prayed for dismissal the claim petitions with costs. 5Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following consolidated issues are framed vide order dated 03.09.2015:- 1.Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent of the respondent No.1 while driving Car bearing registration No HR-54-B-6959 resulting into causing injuries to Sunil Kumar and Pooja, as alleged? SUNIL KUMAR VS RAJ KUMAR ETC 7 OPP. 2If Issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom, the claimants are entitled to ? OPP. 3Whether petitions are not maintainable in the present form ? OPR 4Whether the petitioners have no cause of action or locus standi to file the present petitions ? OPR 5Whether the petitioners have not come to the court with clean hands and have suppressed true and material facts from the court ? OPR 6Whether respondent No.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect ? OPR 7Whether this court has no jurisdiction to try and entertain the present petitions ? OPR 8Whether respondent No. 2 is entitled to take all the defences available to it under the M.V .Act ? OPR 9Relief. 6 To establish the claim of petitioners through this enquiry, petitioners-claimants examined following witnesses:- PW1, Savita Sharma {Criminal Ahlmad in the court of Sh. Rajvinder Singh, JMIC Ambala} has produced the summoned record pertaining to case pertaining to FIR No.50 dated 29.03.2015, u/s 279 and 337 IPC PS Mullana. She produced the recovery memo Ex.P1 and Ex.P2 vide which offending Car as well as RC of car were taken in its possession. She further produced copy of DL Ex.P3 which was valid from 26.05.2014 to 25.05.2034. She further produced mechanical report of vehicle No. HR-01-T-0253 as Ex.P4 and mechanical report of Alto Car SUNIL KUMAR VS RAJ KUMAR ETC 8 bearing registration No. HR-54-B-6959 as Ex.P5 in her evidence. In cross-examination she stated that copy of site plan which is attached with summon file is Ex.P6 and information sent to police is Ex.P7. PW2 Sunil Kumar (Claimant) tendered his affidavit Ex.PW2/A reiterating the averments mentioned in the petition. In cross- examination, he answered that FIR was lodged on his statement, which was recorded in Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt. He was also asked about the contents mentioned in the FIR in further cross-examination by defence counsel. He was also cross examined at length. PW3, Dr. K. K. Gandhotra , C.Lal Hospital Ambala Cantt stated that on 29.03.2015 patient Sunil Kumar was admitted in the hospital as a case of road side accident with the diagnosis of compound fracture both bones right leg. He was operated and debridment close reduction and internal fixation with inter lock nail with skin grafting was done. The patient was discharged on 06.04.2015. He charged Rs.22,500/- for his operation, hospital stay and investigation. The medicines and implant were purchased by patient from the market. He has proved the discharge/ follow up card as Ex.P8, medical bill of Rs.1000/- as Ex.P9, bill of Rs.2000/- as Ex.P10, Bill of Rs.1000/- as Ex.P11, medical bill of Rs.2150/- as Ex.P12, bill of Rs.849/- as Ex.P13, bill of Rs.1685/- as Ex.P14, bill of Rs.18,418/- as Ex.P15, bill of Rs.2241/- as Ex.P16, bill of Rs,22,500/- as Ex.P17, Bill of Rs.350/- as Ex.P18 and bill of Rs.2500/- as Ex.P19. He was cross-examined and thereafter claimants' counsel closed the evidence. SUNIL KUMAR VS RAJ KUMAR ETC 9 On the other hand, counsel for respondent No.1 tendered copy of RC as Ex.R2 and copy of DL as Ex.R3 and closed his evidence on 11.02.2016. Further, counsel for respondent No.1 tendered copy of insurance policy as Ex.R1 and closed his evidence. No rebuttal evidence was led and same was closed on 15.02.2016. 7I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1 : 8 Under this issue, petitioners- claimants are required to establish that motor vehicular accident was occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Respondent no.1, while driving Car bearing registration Number HR-54-B-6959, resulting into causing injuries to them. Learned counsel for claimants has argued that respondent No.1 has been facing trial for the commission of offence under sections 279 and 337 IPC as per statement of PW1 and further claimant while appearing in the witness box as PW2 has duly proved the factum of accident and injuries attributed to him in this accident. So, respondents No.1 being driver-cum-owner and respondent No.2 being insurer are liable to pay appropriate compensation to the claimants and prayed for allowing the instant claim petitions. 9On the other hand, Learned counsel for respondent No.1 has argued that respondent No.1 was holding valid driving licence at the date of accident, though, respondent No.1 has denied the accident but if he is held liable for rash and negligent driving, even then the offending vehicle SUNIL KUMAR VS RAJ KUMAR ETC 10 was insured with respondent No.2 who is liable to indemnify the insured and except this he did not raise any question in these claim petitions and prayed for dismissal the same. 10Learned counsel for respondent No.2 has vehemently argued that no accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1, rather, false FIR was lodged and in view of fact no liability can be fastened upon the insurance company. He further drew attention of this Tribunal towards cross-examination of PW2 in one way or the other and prayed for dismissal the claim petitions being devoid of merits. 11I have given due regard to the rival contentions put forth by learned counsel for respective parties and have evaluated the entire oral evidence coupled with documentary evidence meticulously. After thorough examination, it is observed that accident took place between car and motorcycle on 29.03.2015 at about 1.30 PM and immediately thereafter FIR No.50 dated 29.03.2015 was lodged by PW2. Undisputed, respondent No.1 has been facing trial under section 279 and 337 of IPC before court of Sh. Rajvinder Singh, learned JMIC, Ambala as charges against him was framed on 28.08.2015. In the instant claim petitions, PW2 Sunil Kumar injured tendered his affidavit Ex.PW2/A proving the factum of accident against respondent No.1. He was cross-examined at length but nothing fruitful can be extracted disbelieving the factum of motor vehicular accident at the behest of respondent No.1 and so solitary statement of PW2 corroborated by documentary proof in the statement of SUNIL KUMAR VS RAJ KUMAR ETC 11 PW1, are found sufficient to prove the factum of involvement of offending car in question in the motor vehicular accident. It would be appropriate to mention here that despite availing opportunities, respondents failed to rebut the testimonies of claimants with regard to involvement of offending vehicle falsely in the said accident. Mere denial of rash and negligence at the behest of respondent no.1 after causing accident resulting injuries attributed to three occupants including minor of motorcycle, are not found sufficient at all, disbelieving the factual position of motor vehicular accident. 12It is quite well settled that the lodging of the first information report is also not an essential prerequisite for claiming compensation arising from a motor accident. Each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The Tribunal is expected to adjudge a case on the basis of the evidence produced without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled position of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. It must be remembered that in a motor accident claim, the claimants are not required to prove their case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. It is trite law that claimants-petitioners are required to prove fact relating to the accident which was apparently caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts upon the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way as alleged by the claimants. The provisions with regard to claim under the Act are enacted keeping in view the social welfare of the justice SUNIL KUMAR VS RAJ KUMAR ETC 12 to the community and whenever incident of vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimants are always entitled for compensation irrespective whether the police has registered the offence regarding the incident or not because no claim case can be left over on the mercy of the police. The evidence brought on record irrefutably leads to the inference in terms of un-rebutted evidence at the instance of petitioners that there was taken place accident resulting injuries attributed to claimants. In this way, it can be safely held that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of driver of offending vehicle. Accordingly, this issue no.1 is decided in favour of the claimants. ISSUE NO. 2: 13The onus to prove this issue is upon claimants. Under this issue, compensation amount is to be computed according to injuries, hospitalization and other aspects relating to injured. According to evidence of PW3, it can be gathered that first claimant Sunil was hospitalized in C. Lal hospital w.e.f. 29.3.2015 till 5.4.2015. He was discharged on 6.4.2015 as per document Ex.P8 on file. The claimant had paid a sum of Rs.22,500/- vide Ex.P17 to Dr. K.K.Gandotra of C.Lal Hospital. Additionally, he spent a total sum of Rs.32563/- vide bills Ex.P8 to Ex.P16. EX.P18.EX.P19 and as such he is entitled to total sum of Rs. 55063/-{ in round figure 55100/-} according to expenses accrued in his medical treatment. In Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences versus Prasanth S.Dhananka, 2010 ACJ 38 (SC) , by the three-Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court, it was observed that sympathy for the victim SUNIL KUMAR VS RAJ KUMAR ETC 13 does not, and should not, come in the way of making a correct assessment, but if a case is made out, the Court must not be chary of awarding adequate compensation. It was further observed that the case of an injured and disabled person is, however, more pitiable and the feeling of hurt, helplessness, despair and often destitution ensues every day. The support that is needed by a severely handicapped person comes at an enormous price, physical, financial and emotional, not only on the victim but even more so on his family and attendants and the stress saps their energy and destroys their equanimity. In Arvind Kumar Mishra versus New India Assurance Company Limited, 2010 ACJ 2867 (SC); i t was observed that the whole idea is put the claimant in the same position as he was insofar as money concerned and Perfect compensation is hardly possible but one has to keep in mind that the victim has done no wrong; he has suffered at the hands of the wrongdoer and the Court must take care to give him full and fair compensation for what he had suffered. Since first claimant did not receive physical permanent disability, therefore, in view of law in Raj Kumar Vs Ajay Kumar, (2011)1 SCC 343, the petitioner-claimant is held entitled to the following compensation: Pecuniary damages (Special damages) (i).Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and miscellaneous expenditure.Rs.55100 /-plus {1000/- per day as indoor patient Rs-8000/- including all expenses. (ii).Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising: SUNIL KUMAR VS RAJ KUMAR ETC 14 (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment; (b) Loss of future earning on account of injuries etc. nil/- nil (iii). Future medical expenses. 5000 - None-pecuniary damages (General damages) (iv). Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries. 5000/- (v). Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage). nil (vi).Loss of expectation of life ( shortening of normal longevity). nil /- Total Compensation Rs.73,100/- 14 In view of law laid down in case New India Assurance company limited versus Charlie and another, 2005 (2) Recent Civil Reports 550 , first petitioner is also entitled to interest @ 7.5% per annum on the total awarded compensation from the date of filing of petition till realization of awarded amount. The computation of compensation is just, equitable, fair and reasonable. Remaining relief sought by first petitioner- claimant stand declined. Accordingly, Issue no.2 is decided in the above stated terms, in favour of first petitioner and against the respondents. So far as second claim petition is concerned; petitioner Pooja is wife of first claiamant but she neither appeared in the witness box nor proved any medical bills etc, therefore, she has entirely failed to establish her claim under second petition in any manner and therefore issue no 2 is decided against her for want of evidence. ISSUE NO. 3, 4,5,7 & 8 : 15 The onus to prove these issues are upon Respondents, but SUNIL KUMAR VS RAJ KUMAR ETC 15 they neither pressed these issues nor led any evidence. Further it has been discussed in detail under issue no.1, that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and thus it can not be said that no accident was taken place with offending vehicle or the instant claim petition is not maintainable etc. In this way, it has become obvious for this tribunal that respondents failed to prove these issues and as such this tribunal has left with no other option except to decide the same against Respondents. Accordingly, these issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.6: 16 The onus to prove this issue is upon the respondent No.2, who is under the obligation to prove this fact that the respondent No.1 was not holding a valid driving licence and as such respondent no.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy/cover note EX.R1 and so respondent No.2 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimant. In support to his contentions, he has placed reliance upon following case laws:- In Managing Director, Tamil Nadu State Trans. Corpn. Ltd Vs. Abdul Salam and others, 2004 ACJ 1827 , it has been observed that Pillion rider- Triple riding- Collusion between a bus and motorcycle resulting in death of one of the pillion riders- Tribunal held that accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the bus- Defence that three persons were riding the motorcycle and it was unbalanced and accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the motorcycle- SUNIL KUMAR VS RAJ KUMAR ETC 16 Motorcyclist was at fault for carrying two pillion riders not permitted by law and this fact by itself contribute to the negligence of rider as well as the pillion riders- Appellate court reversed the finding and held the deceased guilty of contributory negligence to the extent of 50 per cent. In Manish Narayan Vs. Seem Bourin & Ors, 2010 (1) ACC 325, It has been observed that deduction towards contributory negligence- Deceased along with one more pillion rider was sitting on scooter- Scooter dashed with car- Nothing brought on record person driving vehicle was holding valid driving licence- Further, driving scooter with two pillion riders is not permissible in law- Case of contributory negligence- 30% of compensation awarded by Tribunal. In Bijoy Kumar Dugar Vs. Bidyadhar Dutta and others, 2006 ACJ 1058 , it has been observed that Head on collusion between a car and bus coming from opposite directions resulting in the death of car driver- Passenger in car deposed that bus was being driven at abnormal speed in a zig zag manner-Deceased having seen the bus from a long distance should have taken due care and precaution to avoid head on collusion- Both the vehicles were damaged in the accident- Car was not knocked on its side- Tribunal appreciated the evidence and held that both the drivers were equally negligent- Tribunal's finding upheld. 17 However, it is apparent on the face of record that respondent No.1 has produced D/L EX.R2 and RC EX.R3 in his evidence. There is nothing on record to show that respondent No.1 was not holding valid driving license at the day of accident. It is further made clear that there SUNIL KUMAR VS RAJ KUMAR ETC 17 were only two occupants with minor son on the motor cycle and so this fact does not infer any adverse impact qua claim of first claimant who sustained injuries in the road accident due to rash and negligence driving of respondent no.2. in this way, respondent no.1 did not breach terms and condition laid down in the insurance policy EX.R1 while plying the vehicle in question on public road. Unquestioned, Insurance Policy Ex.R1 reveal that offending vehicle was insured with the respondent No.2 at the relevant time. The case law relied by counsel for respondent no.2 is not applicable to these petitions. In the fact and circumstances, both respondents are held jointly and severally liable to pay the awarded compensation to claimant and respondent no.2 shall indemnify the insured. Accordingly, this Issue is decided against the respondent No.2. ISSUE NO.9 (RELIEF): FIRST PETITION SUCCEEDS SECOND PETITION FAILS 18 In view of the foregoing discussion, first claim petition stands allowed with costs in a manner that first claimant is entitled to compensation of Rs.70,100/ - along with interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition till the date of actual payment. The awarded amount along with the interest shall be payable jointly and severally by Respondents and respondent no.2 shall indemnify the insured respectively. SECOND CLAIM PETITION STANDS DISMISSED WITH NO ORDER AS TO COSTS. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.3000/- each. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly.

HARJEET KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS JARNAIL RAM & OTHERS -5- 7.On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 tendered copy of registration certificate as Ex.R1, driving licence as Ex.R2 of respondent no.1 bearing no.6013 dated 01.03.2011 originally issued on 03.05.2000 by licensing authority Ambala (Haryana) authorizing to drive LMV/LMVPVT/MCWG, non-transport valid upto 02.05.2020, transport valid upto 02.05.2012, insurance policy/cover note as Ex.R3 valid from 19.11.2014 to 18.11.2015 and thereafter closed evidence vide statement dated 30.11.2015. Learned counsel for respondent no.3 tendered insurance policy as Ex.R4 valid from 19.11.2014 to 18.11.2015, certificate as Ex.R5 dated 04.07.2015 issued by Paramjeet Kaur, the Sarpanch of Gram Panchayat of village Rollon and thereafter closed evidence vide statement dated 12.01.2016. 8.Arguments have been addressed by the learned counsels for the parties and the records have also been perused. My issue-wise findings are as under:- Issue No. 1 9To prove this issue, Jaswant Singh, PW4 has deposed way of affidavit as Ex.PW4/A tendered in his examination-in-chief. He has deposed that, on 12.03.2015 he was coming to his village from village Khellan on motorcycle bearing registration no.HR-01-W-0341. He has further deposed that Amrit Pal Singh was going ahead of him on his HARJEET KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS JARNAIL RAM & OTHERS -6- motorcycle bearing registration no.HR-01-AA-2493. He has further deposed that, Amrit Pal Singh was driving his motorcycle slowly and while driving at about 6.00 p.m. reached near tyre factory of village Khellan, car bearing registration no.HR-01-AK-6181 came from Ambala Cantt. side, being driven by its driver rashly, negligently and by coming on wrong side of road hit against the motorcycle of Amrit Pal Singh, as a result thereof, he fell down and sustained multiple injuries. He has further deposed that Amrit Pal Singh was taken to Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt.; however succumbed to injuries on the way. He has further deposed that aforesaid accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of car bearing registration no.HR-01-AK-6181 by its driver. During cross-examination, he has deposed that he had noticed the offending car for the first time when it was at a distance of about 10 yards from the motorcycle of Amrit Pal Singh. He has further deposed that the accident had taken place on Pucca portion of the road. He has further deposed that it was a head-on collision. He has denied that no accident was caused with the car in question. HC Joginder Singh, PW2 has proved the FIR as Ex.P1. Learned counsel for respondent no.3 has contended that as it was a head-on collision, it is a case of contributory negligence; however, the contention of learned counsel for respondent no.3 is liable to be rejected for the reasons that Jarnail Singh, the respondent no.1 remained unexamined as only he could have deposed and rebutted the evidence led by the petitioners regarding the manner in which HARJEET KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS JARNAIL RAM & OTHERS -7- the accident in question had taken place. Learned counsel for the claimants has relied upon Raju & others Versus Sukhwinder Singh & others, 2007(III) ACC page 254, wherein Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that, “ driver of truck did not enter witness box to deny allegations of witness regarding his involvement in accident; adverse inference can be drawn against him. Further it is absolutely necessary to have the first hand report from the driver. It may be that the driver does not always speak the truth, but the driver's version is the one which is to be given the best consideration. He only knows as to what actually happened. Therefore, the driver having not been examined, necessarily, an adverse inference arises against him ”. Learned counsel for the petitioners has urged that, factum of registration of FIR no.37 dated 13.03.2015 under Sections 279/304-A/427 IPC with Police Station Lalru, District SAS Nagar (Punjab) as Ex.P1 is sufficient to arrive at the conclusion that, the accident in question causing death of Amrit Singh @ Amrit Pal had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of car bearing registration no.HR-01-AK-6181 by Jarnail Ram, the respondent no.1. Learned counsel for the claimants has also placed reliance upon Gurdeep Kaur Versus Tarsem Singh 2008(2) RCR (Civil) page 775 wherein Hon' ble Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that “ if the driver is being tried on account of rash and negligent driving in a criminal case in a court of law, it is prima facie safe to hold that the accident occurred on account of his rash and negligent act. It is further HARJEET KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS JARNAIL RAM & OTHERS -8- held that in a claim petition under Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, the evidence should not be scrutinized in the manner as is done in a civil or in a criminal case. The proceedings before the Tribunal are of the nature of summary enquiry, whereas in a criminal case, the rule is of proof beyond reasonable doubt and in a civil case, the rule is of preponderance of probabilities. If there is some evidence before the claim Tribunal to prove a fact, no nicety, doubt or suspicion should weigh with it, in deciding a Motor Accident Claim case. It is further held that Tribunals established under the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 are not governed by the rules of procedure envisaged by the Civil Procedure Code and Tribunals are required to evolve their own procedure to meet the ends of justice, based on the principles of justice, equity and good conscience” . It is also held in Bimla Devi Versus Himachal Road Transport Corpn. And others AIR 2009 SC 2819 that “ it is not possible to give strict proof of accident by the claimants and they have to establish their case merely on touchstone of preponderance of probability”. The death of Amrit Singh @ Amrit Pal stands proved from the postmortem examination report as marked-PB placed on record. 10In view of the above discussion, it is proved that death of Amrit Singh @ Amrit Pal had occurred on account of the injuries sustained by him in the accident in question, that had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of car bearing registration no.HR-01-AK- HARJEET KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS JARNAIL RAM & OTHERS -9- 6181 by Jarnail Ram, the respondent no.1. Consequently, this issue is decided in favour of claimants and against the respondents. Issue no. 2 11To prove this issue, Harjeet Kaur, PW1, the petitioner no.1, has deposed by way of affidavit, as Ex.PW1/A tendered in her examination-in-chief, reiterating contents of the petition. During cross- examination, she has deposed that Amrit Singh @ Amrit Pal was owner of 6/7 acres of agricultural land. She has further deposed that poultry farm was also in operation at the time of death of her husband and it was on rented premises. She has further deposed that she does not know whether there was any licence of poultry farm with her husband or not. She has further deposed that she does not know as to how many hens and chicken were being maintained in that poultry farm. She has further deposed that she does not know whether in claim petition, it is mentioned that poultry farm had been closed due to to rains prior to the death of Amrit Singh @ Amrit Pal. Though, petitioners have claimed income of Amrit Singh @ Amrit Pal (since deceased) to the tune Rs.25,000/- per month; however, in the absence of cogent evidence, it appears to be on the higher side. Hence, by approximation, his monthly income is taken as Rs.6,000/-. As Amrit Singh @ Amrit Pal ( since deceased) was married having wife, two minor children and old aged parents to maintain; therefore, he must not be spending more than 1/4th of his income towards his own personal and living expenses and remaining 3/4th must be contributing towards HARJEET KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS JARNAIL RAM & OTHERS -10- his family. Reference can be made to Sarla Verma and others Versus Delhi Transport Corporation and another 2009 ACJ 1298 SC. Thus, annual dependency comes to Rs.4500/- x 12 = Rs.54,000/-. Amrit Singh @ Amrit Pal (since deceased) was 28 years of age at the time of his death, as has been mentioned in the postmortem examination report as marked-PB; hence, in this case the suitable multiplier will be of 17. Thus, on calculating compensation on its basis, it comes to Rs.54,000/- x 17 = Rs.9,18,000/-. Further, a sum of Rs.20,000/- on account of transportation, funeral and last rites expenses of the deceased and a sum of Rs.20,000/- on account of loss of consortium are also awarded as compensation to Harjeet Kaur, the claimant no.1. Accordingly, this issue is decided in favour of claimants and against respondents . Issue no. 3. 12Onus to prove this issue was on the insurance company, the respondent no.3; however, respondent no.3 did not lead any evidence to show that vehicle in question i.e. car bearing registration no.HR-01-AK- 6181 was being driven in violation of terms and conditions of insurance policy, as Ex.R4, valid from 19.11.2014 to 18.11.2015. Moreover, learned counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 has tendered registration certificate as Ex.R1, driving licence as Ex.R2 of respondent no.1 bearing no.6013 dated 01.03.2011 originally issued on 03.05.2000 by licensing authority Ambala (Haryana) authorizing to drive LMV/LMVPVT/ MCWG, non-transport valid upto 02.05.2020, transport valid upto HARJEET KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS JARNAIL RAM & OTHERS -11- 02.05.2012, insurance policy/cover note as Ex.R3 valid from 19.11.2014 to 18.11.2015; hence, under these circumstances, the respondent no.3 has failed to discharge its onus. Accordingly, this issue is decided against respondent no.3 and in favour of the claimant. Issue no.4 (Relief) 13In view of the discussion made above, the present claim petition is partly allowed with costs and a sum of Rs. 9,58,000/- in all is awarded as compensation to the claimants. Out of total amount of compensation i.e. Rs.9,58,000/-, a sum of Rs.20,000/- on account of transportation, funeral, last rites expenses of the deceased and a sum of Rs.20,000/- on account of loss of consortium shall be payable exclusively to Harjeet Kaur, the claimant no.1. Out of remaining amount of compensation i.e. a sum of Rs.9,18,000/-, a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- lac each shall be payable to Simardeep Kaur and Sahajdeep Singh, the claimants no.2 and 3; a sum of Rs.50,000/- each shall be payable to Ranbir Kaur and Charanjit Singh, the claimants no.4 and 5 and remaining amount of Rs.5,18,000/- shall be payable to Harjeet Kaur, the claimant no.1. Out of the share of claimant no.1, 50% shall be payable to her in cash and remaining 50% shall be deposited in her name in maximum interest bearing fixed deposit scheme for a period of five years in a nationalised bank; whereas the amount of share of Ranbir Kaur and Charanjit Singh, the claimants no.4 and 5 shall be payable to them in cash; however, the share of Simardeep Kaur and Sahajdeep Singh , the HARJEET KAUR & OTHERS VERSUS JARNAIL RAM & OTHERS -12- minor claimants no.2 and 3 , shall be deposited in their names in maximum interest bearing fixed deposit scheme in a nationalised bank till they attain majority . The claimants are also held entitled to interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing the claim petition till realization. As has already been held above, the accident in question had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of car bearing registration no.HR-01-AK-6181 by its driver; hence, Jarnail Ram, the respondent no.1 being driver, Sandeep Kumar, the respondent no.2 being owner and the National Insurance Company Limited, the respondent no.3, being insurer of car bearing registration no.HR-01-AK-6181 shall be liable jointly and severally to pay the compensation to the claimant-petitioners.

At about 4.15 PM, respondent No.1 Johny Kumar @ Johny was sitting on Tractor Ace 450, DC, Model 2013, Engine No. A498BTT 13114001, Chasis No. 07134515466, which was standing in front of M/s Pandit Trading Company, Adhoya Hinduaan, P .S.Barara, District Ambala, on Babain to Triveni Chowk, Barara Road, while its engine was on running mode and when respondent No.1 put tractor in gear then he was unable to control over the same, as a result of that, tractor turned DAYALO RANI ETC VS JOHNY KUMAR @ JOHNY ETC 3 towards its left hand side and its bumper hit twice or thrice to the chest and face of Ravi Kumar @ Banti while remained in motion from its front side after going forward and back side and so Ravi Kumar @ Banti sustained multiple grievous injuries on his chest and face and blood started oozing out from the ear and mouth, whereupon, Amar Nath shouted loudly and asked respondent No.1 to control/stop his tractor, but respondent No.1 remained unable to control over tractor. The running tractor after hitting Ravi Kumar @ Banti stopped at the spot due to slip and respondent No.1 got alighted from tractor and fled from the spot leaving behind the tractor at the spot. This accident was witnessed by Amar Nath, Pardeep and Rajesh Kumar, all residents of Adhoya Hinduaan.

He was a permanent employee and was getting annual increment and having very bright future prospects. If he remained alive with in few years his salary could cross Rs.20,000/- per month. His DAYALO RANI ETC VS JOHNY KUMAR @ JOHNY ETC 4 average income may be taken as Rs.15,000/- per month for the purpose of dependency and assessment of compensation. He was unmarried. All the claimants were solely dependent on the salary of deceased. He used to hand over his entire salary to claimants for running household and other day today expenses. He was sole bread earner of his family. He was to support, maintain and look after the claimants in their old age.

Apart from taking preliminary objections regarding maintainability, locus-standi, concealment of true and material facts, on merit, it is denied about factum of accident by the answering respondent as he was not driving the tractor Sonalika 450 DC, Model 2013, rather, deceased Ravi Kumar @ Banti died due to the injuries suffered by him in some other accident/incident; that a false and frivolous FIR has been lodged by the claimants in connivance with the police only to get compensation by involving the said tractor and answering respondent No.1 has no concern with the alleged accident; that exaggerated amount has been claimed as compensation by the claimants; that name of DAYALO RANI ETC VS JOHNY KUMAR @ JOHNY ETC 5 answering respondent has been mentioned in the FIR wrongly at the behest of claimants, whereas, the answering respondent has not caused any accident on the alleged date and time; that FIR has been lodged against him in connivance with the police on false grounds; that deceased might have suffered injuries in some other accident and died later on, but the answering respondent has not caused any accident nor was sitting on the offending tractor in question, as such, the claim petition against him is totally false and frivolous and prayed for dismissal the same with costs. 4Respondent No.2 filed separate written statement taking preliminary objection that the claim petition is false, frivolous, vague and incomplete qua materials particulars, engineered with the sole aim to make fortune out of misfortune and is not tenable under the law; that the amount of compensation claimed are highly exaggerated and exorbitant, without any legal and reasonable basis; that motive of the claimants are only to indulge in speculative litigation, taking advantage of of the fact that no court fee is payable on the institution of cases under the Motor Vehicle Act before MACT and that object of beneficial litigation is being frustrated by its misuse. On merit, it is denied factum of accident, income, age and evocation of the deceased and submitted tha a false report of accident was lodged with ulterior motive to claim compensation. The story of involvement of the tractor was later on manipulated by the claimant in association with false witnesses to claim compensation. Rest of averments raised in the petition are denied and prayed for dismissal the same with costs. DAYALO RANI ETC VS JOHNY KUMAR @ JOHNY ETC 6 5The respondent No.3 (insurance company) filed separate written statement controverting the contents made in the petition, taking preliminary objections that claim petition qua the answering respondent is ex-facie, misconceived, vexatious, untenable and devoid of merit; that the claimants have no locus standi or cause of action to file the present petition; that the petition is bad for mis joinder and non joinder of necessary parties; that claim petition has neither been signed, nor framed nor verified or presented in accordance with law; that although tractor in question was not involved in the alleged accident, but even if it was no road, the same was being driven without valid registration certificate, fitness certificate, permit and by a person not having a valid and effective driving licence to the knowledge of the owner thereof in violation of law and terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if any; that the respondent No.1 and 2 are thus negligent and have breached the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if any and the provisions of Motor Vehicles Act; that answering respondent reserve to amend the objections at a later stage, if some new facts emerge and the necessity arises to amend the objections later on; that without prejudice and without admitting any liability, what so ever, the answering respondent states that its liability, if at all, is limited to the extent as provided under section 147(2) and other provisions of M. V .

RW3 Subhash Chander , Licence Clerk, Office of SDM Barara, has produced the summoned record pertaining to renewal of old Driving licence No. NL-03/27825/NAG issued by LA Nagaland, which was renewed by the Licensing Authority (HR-54) the licensing authority vide Driving licence No. HR5420140036686 dated 05.11.2014 in the name of Johny Kumar son of Brij Pal, resident of Village Adhoya, Tehsil Barara, District Ambala authorizing him to drive motor cycle with gear, ljght motor vehicle non transport light motor vehicle Tractor (NT) valid from 05.11.2014 to 04.11.2034.

In rebuttal evidence, learned counsel tendered copy of 10+2 mark sheet as EX.P9 and birth certificate of deceased Ravi Kumar AS EX.P10 and closed the same. 8I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on various issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1: 9 Under this issue, claimants-petitioners are required to establish fact that motor vehicular accident was occurred due to sole rash and DAYALO RANI ETC VS JOHNY KUMAR @ JOHNY ETC 16 negligent driving of Respondent no.1, resulting into death of Ravi Kumar @ Banti. Learned counsel for claimants has argued that PW2 Amar Nath is relevant eye witness, who has proved the factum of accident and his statement is also corroborated with documentary proof Ex.P2 to Ex.P8 and so respondent No.1 being driver is criminally liable to be punished under section 279, 304-A of IPC before trial court and prayed for deciding this issue in favour of claimants. 10On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent No.3 has argued that statement of PW2 Amar Nath suffers with contradiction with his previous version recorded as per FIR Ex.P2 to the effect that PW2 was only present at the time of accident, whereas, it has been mentioned in FIR that accident was witnessed by many persons. He further argued that statement of PW2 Amar Nath being interested witness { uncle of deceased} relating to accident is not believable, therefore, mere lodging FIR and submission of challan under section 173 Cr.P.C would not liable respondent No.1 to be punished under section 279/304 A of IPC and prayed for deciding this issue against the claimants. Further learned counsel for respondents No.1 and 2 did not raise dispute that trail against respondent no.1 is pending before trial court but prayed for deciding this issue against the claimants. 11 I have given due regard to the rival contentions put forth by learned counsel for respective parties and have evaluated entire oral evidence coupled with documentary evidence carefully. According to evidence of PW2, it can be gathered that on 22.03.2015 Ravi Kumar @ DAYALO RANI ETC VS JOHNY KUMAR @ JOHNY ETC 17 Banti was sitting on a bench lying in front of shop of his employer on extreme left hand side berm of Babain to Triveni Chowk Barara Road, within the area of P.S. Barara, Adhoya Hinduaan, Tehsil Barara, District Ambala. At about 4.15 PM, respondent No.1 Johny Kumar @ Johny was sitting on offending vehicle, which was standing in front of M/s Pandit Trading Company, while its engine was on running mode and when respondent No.1 put tractor in gear, then he was unable to control over the same, as a consequence, tractor turned towards its left hand side and its bumper hit twice or thrice to the chest and face of Ravi Kumar @ Banti while remained in motion from its front side after going forward and back side and so blood started oozing out from his ear and mouth, whereupon, PW2 Amar Nath shouted loudly and asked respondent No.1 to control or stop his tractor, but respondent No.1 remained unable to control over tractor. The running tractor after hitting Ravi Kumar @ Banti stopped at the spot due to slip. Although, PW2 was cross examined at length but nothing fruitful can be elicited which may disbelieve factum of accident with deceased Ravi Kumar. It is further made clear that if a witness is to be cross examined on various aspect, then it would be of normal course to come out discrepency like contradiction in to picture as no witness would depose parrot like version while answering various questions after recollecting his memory but such contradiction would not disbelieve credible and reliable portion of evidence in any manner. It is evident that FIR was lodged on same day and Investigation was carried out and on culmination of investigation, respondent No.1 was found involved in the DAYALO RANI ETC VS JOHNY KUMAR @ JOHNY ETC 18 commission of crime and he is also facing trial before trial court. It is quite well settled preposition of law that Each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The Tribunal is expected to adjudge a case on the basis of the evidence adduced without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled position of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. It must be remembered that in a motor accident claim, the claimants are not required to prove their case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. It is trite law that claimants-petitioners are required to prove its case, which sets up the particular fact relating to the accident , which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts upon the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way as alleged by the claimants. Here, respondent no.1 did not come in the witness box to rebut the version of PW2. The provisions with regard to claim under the Act are enacted keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimants are always entitled for compensation. The evidence proved on record irrefutably leads to the inference that offending vehicle was involved in the motor vehicular accident due to rash and negligent driving by respondent No.1, resulting death of unmarried young boy and FIR was also registered against respondent No.1 who is facing trial. In view of case law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993 (2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep DAYALO RANI ETC VS JOHNY KUMAR @ JOHNY ETC 19 Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008 (2) R.C.R. (Civil) 774 , it can be safely said that respondent No.1 was responsible in causing the motor vehicular accident due to his rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Accordingly, this issue no.1 is decided in favour of the claimants. ISSUE NO. 2: 12 The onus to prove this issue, is upon claimants. PW1 categorically stated that her son Ravi Kumar alais Banti was died on account of the injuries suffered by him in a motor vehicular accident at the age of 20 years four month {D.O.B. 25.11.1994}, leaving behind parents and two brothers. The deceased was unmarried and was enjoying very good health and physique and was doing job as labour . It is not understandable that as to why younger brother of deceased has been arrayed as calimant no.3 in presence of his parents i.e claimant no.1 &2 who are duty bound to look after and maintain their children. In this way it can not be said that all claimants including younger brother were fully dependent upon income of deceased, but at the same time it can be said that parents on account of untimely death of their prime youth son were deprived from the services like contribution of income of their son and they all have suffered mental shock and agony. The parents were expecting high hopes from their son, as he was earning hands. PW1 also stated that claimants have spent sufficient amount on transportation of dead body and funeral/ last rites of their deceased son. The claimants have also deprived love and affection. It may not be out of place to mention here that the monetary compensation will never be a sufficient DAYALO RANI ETC VS JOHNY KUMAR @ JOHNY ETC 20 succor for victims of accidental cases, rather their needs can only be prevented by providing just compensation. The best manner in which victims can be compensated for sufferings only to prevent recurrence of any such road incident. In failure to protect or prevent the sufferings of victims due to death of their bread earner in road accident, it also imposes liability of state to take extra ordinary precaution to reduce such type of road accident by deputing sufficient trained traffic police for compliance of strict traffic rules to avoid such incident. It will certainly take lot of time for rehabilitation by the family members of deceased. 13 So far as the income of the deceased is concerned; it is made clear that PW1 could not be able to disclose exact monthly income of deceased. PW1 has admitted that her husband and father of deceased is earning Rs 200/300 per day from labour work which he received occasionally. It is also evident that elder son namely Avinash of PW1 is also earning income from labour work. It would be appropriate to say that parents of deceased are generally entitled to compensation without going into deep question of dependency and as such notional income of the deceased as labourer by guess work is being taken Rs. 6000/- and 50% of the amount is deducted on account his living and personal expenses being unmarried and young boy of 20 years and four months. It is further made clear that mother's age of deceased at the day of accident was 46 years, therefore, this tribunal finds appropriate to consider mother's between 46- 50 and as such multiplier of 13 is to be applied i n view of Smt. Sarla DAYALO RANI ETC VS JOHNY KUMAR @ JOHNY ETC 21 Verma and Ors. Vs Delhi Transport Corporation and another AIR 2009 Supreme Court 3104. In this way, by applying multiplier of 13 as per age of deceased mother, assessment of compensation would come to {36000x13} Rs. 4,68000/-. Additionally, petitioners no.1&2 being parents have deprived from love and affection and also suffered pain, agony due to untimely death of their son, therefore, they are entitled to Rs.50000/- in that head. They have also spent amount on last rites/funeral of deceased and so they are entitled to funeral expenses amounting Rs.25,000/- and in this manner, total compensation is computed to Rs.5,43,000/- which shall be payable to the petitioner no.1 only along with interest @ 7.5/- per annum from the date of filing the petition till its realization. Accordingly, issue no.2 is decided in favour of claimants-petitioners. Rests of relief sought by petitioners-claimants stands declined. ISSUE No.3 : 14 Under this issue, respondent No.3 is required to establish that instant claim petition is not maintainable. Learned counsel for respondent No.3 pointed out the fact that PW2 Amar Nath is author of FIR, who disclosed in the second line of FIR that deceased was son of Jagan Nath instead of Ram Nath. It is further argued that PW2 Amar Nath are five brothers. For the sake of discussion, if parents of deceased Ravi Kumar were not alive and petitioners being uncle and aunt got compensation by misrepresenting the facts before this Tribunal, then certainly it would cause serious injustice to respondent No.3. He urged that claimants are not first class legal heirs of deceased Ravi Kumar and prayed for deciding DAYALO RANI ETC VS JOHNY KUMAR @ JOHNY ETC 22 this issue in favour of respondent no.3. 15On the other hand, learned counsel for claimants has vehemently argued that deceased was son of petitioners No.1 and 2 and name of Jagan Nath was inadvertantly mentioned in the second line of FIR, which was duly corrected in subsequent line of FIR. He further drew attention of this Tribunal towards DL of deceased and 12 th standard educational certificate as Mark-B showing his father's name as Ram Nath and so respondent No.3 is raising wrong plea without rebutting the version of PW1 who deposed on oath that deceased was her son and if it is not so, then certainly she will be held liable for perjury and prayed for deciding this issue against respondent No.3. 16Having considered the rival contentions and perusing the entire evidence, it is observed that respondent No.3 could not be able to rebut the fact that deceased was son of Jagan Nath, rather, it is well established on record that deceased was son of Ram Nath and so mere mentioning wrong name in the second line of FIR by informant Amar Nath, would not draw any adverse inference, especially in the circumstances, when PW1 {claimant No.1 Dayalo Rani @ Dayalo being mother} has deposed on oath that Ravi Kumar alias Banti was her son and so statement of PW1 in the shape of affidavit corroborated with documentary proof i.e DL of deceased and educational certificate Mark-B are found sufficient to establish that deceased was son of claimant no.1&2 and so they being parents are entitled to file the claim petition under section 166 of Motor Vehicles Act. Accordingly, Issue No.3 is decided DAYALO RANI ETC VS JOHNY KUMAR @ JOHNY ETC 23 against respondent No.3. ISSUE NO 4 to 6, 8 & 9 : 17The onus to prove these issues are upon Respondents, but they neither pressed these issue nor led any evidence. Further, it has already discussed in detail under Issue No.1 & 2 that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. In this way, it has become obvious on file that this tribunal has left with no other option except to decide these issues against Respondents. Accordingly, all these issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.7 : 18 The onus to prove this issue is upon the respondent No.3, who is under the obligation to prove this fact that the respondent No.1 was not having a valid driving licence and registration certificate at the time of alleged accident and as such respondent no.2 has violated the terms and conditions of insurance policy EX.R9 and so respondent No.3 is not liable to pay any compensation. Learned counsel for respondent No.3 has argued that offending vehicle in question did not have registration certificate, rather, same was got registered after the accident. Learned counsel has drawn attention of this Tribunal towards statement of RW1, who categorically stated that copy of Temporary registration dated 20.09.2013 was valid upto 19.10.2013 and copy of sale certificate dated 07.05.2014 and Registration Certificate Ex.R10 make it ample clear that offending vehicle was registered after accident. He further argued that offending vehicle was using for commercial purpose. It is further argued that respondent No.1 was DAYALO RANI ETC VS JOHNY KUMAR @ JOHNY ETC 24 earlier occupying DL being issued from authority in state of Nagaland and subsequently DL Ex.R12 was got renewed from SDM Barara without verification of DL issued by State of Nagaland and so respondent No.3 collected verification report Ex.R22 from the authority in state of Nagaland, which reveals that DL would be treated as cancelled, other than smart card format and so earlier DL and subsequent renewal of DL are not believable being procured one and so respondent No.3 is not liable to indemnify the claim. In support to his contentions, he placed reliance upon following authorities:- In M/s Natwar Parikh & Co.Ltd. Vs. State of Karnataka and Other, 2005 (3) PLR 775, it has been observed that Trailer- Even though a trailer is drawn by a Motor vehicle, it by itself being a motor vehicle, the tractor trailer would constitute a “Goods carriage” under Section 2 (14) and, consequently, a “Transport vehicle” under Section 2 (47)- The test to be applied in such a case is whether the vehicle is proposed to be used for transporting goods from one place to another- When a vehicle is so altered or prepared that it become apt for use for transporting goods, it can be stated that it is adapted for the carriage of goods. In National Insurance Co.Ltd. Vs. Rattani & Ors, 2009(1) ACC 417, it has been observed that Liability of Insurance Company- Deceased and injured, about 30-40 persons, were members of marriage party only- They could not have travelled in goods vehicle as representatives of owner of goods- Even if submission that in truck goods offered by way of gift by bridge party were being transported is correct, deceased and others could not have become DAYALO RANI ETC VS JOHNY KUMAR @ JOHNY ETC 25 representatives of owners of goods, meaning thereby, articles of gift- In view of averments made in claim petition and FIR said contention cannot be accepted- Tribunal and also High Court committed various error in opining that Insurance Company was liable- As victims of accidents were travelling in truck as gratuitous passengers, appellant was not liable to pay amount of compensation to claimants-impugned judgement unsustainable in so far as liability of appellant is concerned. In New India Assurance Co.Ltd. Vs. Kusum & Ors, 2010 (2) ACC 518, it has been observed that Owner has a duty to see that vehicle is driven by a person having a valid driving licence- Instead and in place of insurer, owner of vehicle shall be liable to satisfy the decree- It would be travesty of Justice, if Insurance Company which is directed to pay amount and then face immense difficulties in executing a decree- Impugned judgments unsustainable and set aside. In Mounesh Vs. Thimmanna and another, 2011 ACJ 2054, it has been observed that Goods vehicle- Tractor trailer- Whether tractor trailer used for transportation of agricultural produce and other goods is a goods vehicle- Held: Yes. In Uma Sharma and another Vs. Avtar Singh and others, 2012 (2) PLR 254, it has been observed that Deceased bachelor- So the amount of dependency would be 50 % of the income- Guiding factor for multiplier is the age of the parents. In Subhash Chand and others Vs. Satya Rani and others, 2013 (2) PLR 329, it has been observed that there existed no transport vehicle endorsement in the licence- A tractor with the trolley attached is a transport vehicle as defined under the Motor Vehicles Act that it requires a special endorsement under DAYALO RANI ETC VS JOHNY KUMAR @ JOHNY ETC 26 Section 3 of the Motor Vehicles Act- If there was no special endorsement, he will not be said to be duly licensed. It was further observed that Issuance of operation of Section 149 (4) Proviso and Section 149 (5) of the Motor Vehicles Act make it clear that if there is a violation of terms of policy, the Insurance Company shall have a right to recover the amount of liability which it had to shoulder- Liability therefore cannot be excluded for the Insurance Company for making the payment to the claimant- It will have only a right of recovery against the insured for the violation of terms of policy. In Jamil Khan and another Vs. Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co.Ltd, 2013 ACJ 1640, it has been observed that Evidence that driver was not holding a valid licence for driving a commercial vehicle for which specific endorsement was required to be obtained from the competent authority- Whether there was breach of policy and insurance company is absolved from liability- Held: Yes. It was further held that Liability of Insurance Company- Insurance company disputes its liability on the ground that offending vehicle was being plied by the insured without any route permit- Owner and driver led no evidence to establish that there was no violation of the terms and conditions of the policy- Whether there was breach of policy and insurance company is absolved from liability- Held: Yes. In Narinder Singh Vs. New India Assirance Co.Ltd, 2014 ACJ 2421, it has been observed that Using a vehicle on public road without any registration- Is not only an offence punishable under Section 192 of M. V . Act- But also a fundamental breach of terms and conditions of policy contract- Insurance Company not liable DAYALO RANI ETC VS JOHNY KUMAR @ JOHNY ETC 27 for damages. In Suresh Kumar Vs. Cholamandalam Ms General Insurance Co. Ltd and others, FAO 1623-2014 (O&M) decided on 21.03.2014, it has been observed that the driving licence held by the appellant is fake. The court is free to take appropriate steps according to law for placing on record of the court a fake driving licence-Dismissed.In Hanuman Singh Vs. Sona Devi and others, 2016 ACJ 669, it has been observed that Motor Insurance- Driving licence- Liability of Insurance Company- Pay and recover order- Offending vehicle, a pick-up van described in the insurance policy as a 'Goods carrying public carrier', was driven by a driver having licence to drive light motor vehicle- Tribunal directed insurance company to pay the award and then recover from the owner of Pick-up van- Owner contended that vehicle was weighing less than 7,500 Kg and no goods were being carried in it, it qualifies as light motor vehicle and driver was duly licensed- Pick-up van insured as goods carrying vehicle and public carrier cannot lose that character by fact of not carrying goods at the relevant time- Driver without endorsement on his licence authorising him to drive a transport vehicle is not duly licensed to drive a pick up van- Whether Tribunal was justified in directing insurance company to recover the amount paid from the owner- Held: Yes. In Partap Singh Vs. National Insurance Co.Ltd and others, 2016 (2) T.A.C 166, it has been observed that A goods carriage does not cease to have requirement of permit merely because at relevant time goods were not being transported- While straying away from route permit cannot be a valid defence under Section 149, absent of permit. In Mnshi Ram and DAYALO RANI ETC VS JOHNY KUMAR @ JOHNY ETC 28 another Vs. Balkar Singh and others, 2016 (2) PLR 526, it has been observed that Driving Licence- A response through RTI is of a public officer and it is a public document and would require not further corroboration in the manner contemplated under Section 77 of the Evidence Act- The document must be taken to be true of what its recitals state. 19 On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents No.1 and 2 has vehemently argued that offending vehicle was very much insured on the basis of sale certificate with respondent No.3 and further respondent No.3 never demanded for furnishing registration certificate, rather, they got registration of offending vehicle on the basis of sale certificate. He further argued that respondent No.2 got registration certificate from competent authority on payment of late fee etc and so mere non registration of offending vehicle at the day of accident would not exonerate the liability of respondent No.3. He further argued that as and when incident took place at that time offending vehicle was not using commercially and so this plea is not acceptable. Learned counsel for respondent No.1 has argued that respondent No.1 was holding valid DL at the day of accident. His DL was renewed by competent authority on 05.11.2014 as Ex.R12 and verification report Ex.R13 relating to renewal of DL along with documents Ex.R14 to Ex.R21 make it clear that respondent No.1 was holding a valid DL at the day of accident and so respondent No.3 is liable to indemnify the claimants and prayed for deciding this issue against respondent No.3. 20 Considering the rival contentions, it is made clear that DAYALO RANI ETC VS JOHNY KUMAR @ JOHNY ETC 29 offending vehicle was duly insured vide Insurance Policy Ex.R9 on the basis of sale certificate. Unquestioned, respondent No.2 did not get permanent registration number from the competent authority and it was obtained after the accident on payment of late fee. However, if registration certificate was required for issuance of insurance policy, then it was incumbent upon respondent No.3 to ask the insured to furnish registration certificate, prior or even after issuance of insurance policy, but as per record, no such demand was ever made at the behest of respondent No.3 and so if respondent No.2 got registration certificate after the accident on payment of late fee etc during the period of insurance policy, then respondent No.3 can not escape from liability to indemnify the claim. The case law relied by counsel are not identical with the facts of the case and same can not be applied and as such contention raised by learned counsel for respondent No.3 can not be sustained being devoid of merit. Coming to next contention raised with regard to commercial use of offending vehicle which is also not found acceptable, because of reason that at the day of accident, the offending vehicle was neither loaded nor used for commercial purpose, rather, it was standing and respondent No.1 was sitting on the driver seat and started its engine and without controlling over the offending vehicle hit to Ravi Kumar who was sitting on bench, as a consequence, he was succumbed to his injuries. Since offending vehicle was not being used for commercial purpose at the day of accident, therefore, it cannot be said respondent No.3 is not liable to indemnify the claim as such contention of counsel can not be accepted being devoid of merit. Coming to next contention with regard to DL of respondent No.1, it is apparent that DAYALO RANI ETC VS JOHNY KUMAR @ JOHNY ETC 30 respondent No.1 was holding valid DL Ex.R12 at the day of accident and so if earlier DL was being issued from state of Nagaland, it would not disbelieve the credibility and genuineness with regard to renewal DL which was being issued by competent authority after obtaining No Objection etc in any manner. In Neearj Katyal & ors Vs. state & Ors,2016{3}Civil court Cases 328 , it has been observed that mere exhibiting a document is not a proof of its contents. Contents of document has to be proved in accordance with law. Thus, mere production of document EX.P22 would not disbelieve the sanctity of renewal D/L and so contention raised by counsel for respondent No.3 is not acceptable being devoid of merit. According, this issue is decided against respondent No.3. ISSUE NO.10 (RELIEF): PETITION SUCCEEDS ; 21 In view of the foregoing discussion, instant claim petition stands allowed with costs in a manner that the claimants-petitioners are held entitled to compensation of Rs.5,43,000/- along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this claim petition till the date of actual payment.

MACP No.41 of 2015 Sanampreet Singh Vs. Kuldeep Singh etc. MACP No.42 of 2015 Harmanpreet Singh Vs. Kuldeep Singh etc. AWARD: This award shall dispose off two claim petitions titled above, filed under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act'), as both of them have arisen out of the same motor vehicular accident. 2. According to the petitioners, on 13.09.2014, both of them were going from Ambala to Banur (Punjab) on Activa Scooter bearing registration No. PB-65S-1619, being driven by Harmanpreet Singh, with Sanampreet Singh as the pillion rider. At about 03:00 pm, when they reached near Manji Sahib Gurdwara, Ghas Mandi turning, towards Rajpura, a truck bearing registration No. HR-65-5089 (offending vehicle), being driven by respondent no.1 at very high speed, rashly and negligently, came from behind and hit the Activa of the claimants, as a result of which, both of them fell down resulting into injuries to them. They were shifted to civil hospital, Ambala City. On the statement of Harmanpreet Singh, FIR N: 343 dated 13.9.2014 at P.S. Ambala City under section 279, 337 & 427 IPC was registered against respondent no.1. 3. In the Ist petition, petitioner Sanampreet Singh submits that he was 18 1/2 years of age at the time of accident and was to join a Higher Study Course at Australia Institute (Perth Institute of Business and Technology) / Edith Cowan University, Perth and for that course, he had spent Australian Dollars 13793 (Approximately 8,27,580/-) as an ₹ advance fee and was to leave India on airways ticket on 24.09.2014. He was enjoying very good health and physique prior to the accident. After the accident, he has become disabled permanently. He remained hospitalized in Fortis Hospital, Mohali and had undergone treatment and operation besides treatment as an outdoor patient. His further education has also been adversely affected. He has spent more than 7,90,000/- on ₹ his treatment etc. and still requires a huge amount to be spent on his treatment. With these pleadings, petitioner Sanampreet Singh has claimed (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page No. 2 of 14 Pages) Dated: 21.07.2016. MACP No.41 of 2015 Sanampreet Singh Vs. Kuldeep Singh etc. MACP No.42 of 2015 Harmanpreet Singh Vs. Kuldeep Singh etc. compensation of 25 lacs against all the respondents, who are the ₹ respective driver, owner and insurer of the offending truck. 4.In the IInd petition, petitioner Harmanpreet Singh submits that he was 21 years of age at the time of accident and was enjoying very good health and physique prior to the accident. After the accident, he has become disabled permanently. Initially, he was taken to Civil Hospital, Ambala, from where he was referred to Fortis Hospital, Mohali and then shifted to Gian Sagar Hospital, Banur (Punjab). He has spent more than 2,00,000/- on his treatment etc. With these pleadings, petitioner₹ Harmanpreet Singh has claimed compensation of 5 lacs against all the ₹ respondents, who are the respective driver, owner and insurer of the offending truck. 5.Respondents no.1 and 2 in their written statements in both the petitions raised preliminary objections about claim petitions being not maintainable; and no such accident having taken place. On merits, the age, profession, income etc. of the petitioners have been denied and pleading that injured might have suffered injuries in the accident by some unknown vehicle, dismissal of the petitions has been sought for. 6. Respondent no.3 i.e. Insurance Company, in its similar written statements in both the petitions, raised preliminary objections material being that claim petition has been filed in collusion with respondents no.1 and 2 just to extract compensation from it; and that if the cause of accident is proved, even then, it is not liable to pay any compensation since respondent no.1 was not having a valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident and was driving it in violation of terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy and that petitioners/injured suffered alleged injuries due to own rash and negligent driving of driver of the car. On merits, contents of the claim petitions including nature of injuries, profession, income, expenditure on treatment etc. of the (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page No. 3 of 14 Pages) Dated: 21.07.2016. MACP No.41 of 2015 Sanampreet Singh Vs. Kuldeep Singh etc. MACP No.42 of 2015 Harmanpreet Singh Vs. Kuldeep Singh etc. petitioners have been denied and it is pleaded that a false and manipulated FIR was registered in connivance with the local police and in collusion with respondents no.1 and 2 after the alleged occurrence just to save the driver/owner of the car involved in the accident. With this stand and controverting other averments of the petitions, prayer is made for dismissal of the same. 7. Both the claim petitions were consolidated vide order dated 20.08.2015. Evidence was directed to be recorded in Ist petition titled 'Sanampreet Singh Vs. Kuldeep Singh and others'. 8. Following consolidated issues were framed for adjudication:- 1.Whether the accident in question took place by rash and negligent driving of truck bearing registration No. HR-65-5089 by respondent no.1 Kuldeep Singh resulting in to injuries to claimants Sanampreet Singh and Harmanpreet Singh, as alleged?OPP. 2. If issue no.1 is proved, whether the claimants are entitled to compensation, if so, how much and from whom?OPP. 3.Whether the respondent no.1 was not having a valid and effective driving licence on the date of accident, if so, its effect?OPR (3). 4.Whether respondent no.2 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy and the respondent no.3 is not liable to indemnify the respondent no.2 ?OPR (3). 5.Relief. 9.Parties have produced evidence to support their respective stand. 10.I have heard arguments of learned counsel for the parties at length and have appraised evidence on record thoroughly and carefully. My findings on various issues are as under:- (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page No. 4 of 14 Pages) Dated: 21.07.2016. MACP No.41 of 2015 Sanampreet Singh Vs. Kuldeep Singh etc. MACP No.42 of 2015 Harmanpreet Singh Vs. Kuldeep Singh etc. Issue No.1: 11. In support of this issue, one of the petitioners, namely Harmanpreet Singh appeared in the witness-box as PW1 and by way of his affidavit Ex.PW1/A, tendered as his examination-in-chief, he testified about the manner of accident, as mentioned in the petition. Said Harmanpreet Singh was driving Activa scooter No. PB 65-S-1619, on which the other claimant Sanampreet Singh was pillion rider and as the testimony of PW1 reveals that his Activa was hit from behind by truck No.HR65-5089, which was being driven by respondent no.1 in rash and negligent manner. PW1 has also tendered in evidence documents Ex.P1 to Ex.P13. These include FIR Ex.P13, which was lodged on his complaint to the police on the same day. PW1 has been cross-examined at length but nothing could be elicited so as to disbelieve him. 12. PW2 Mrs. Veena Sharma is Addl. Ahlmad in the Court of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ambala, who brought summoned file of case titled “State Vs. Kuldeep” arising out of FIR no.343 dated 13.09.2014 registered at Police Station, Ambala City under Sections 279, 337,338 and 427 IPC, in which respondent no.1 Kuldeep is facing trial pertaining to the accident of this case. PW2 deposed that charge against accused Kuldeep has already been framed by the Court. 13. PW3 Dr. Vishal Verma of GMCH Sector-32, Chandigarh, has deposed about the treatment provided to the petitioner Sanampreet Singh on 13.09.2014. 14. There is no evidence in rebuttal on the part of the respondents on this issue. It is relevant to mention that though, the respondents denied the involvement of truck No.HR65-5089 in the accident, but none of them dared to examine the driver of the said vehicle i.e. respondent no.1 so as to controvert statement of PW1 regarding the manner of accident or to prove the stand as taken in the written statement. In these circumstances, (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page No. 5 of 14 Pages) Dated: 21.07.2016. MACP No.41 of 2015 Sanampreet Singh Vs. Kuldeep Singh etc. MACP No.42 of 2015 Harmanpreet Singh Vs. Kuldeep Singh etc. adverse inference is liable to be drawn against the respondents to the effect that in case, respondent no.1 entered the witness-box, he could not have withstood the test of cross-examination. 15. Having regard to the above discussion, I find absolutely no reason to disbelieve unchallenged and unrebutted testimony of PW1. Relying on the same, it is held that accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of truck No.HR65-5089, which was being driven by respondent no.1 Kuldeep Singh on 13.09.2014 resulting into causing of injuries to both the claimants namely Harmanpreet Singh and Sanampreet Singh. Issue no.1 is decided accordingly, in favour of the claimants. ISSUE NO.2 MACT CASE NO.15 OF 2015 TITLED “SANAMPREET SINGH VS. KULDEEP SINGH AND OTHERS: 16.Claimant of this case namely, Sanampreet Singh, has not entered the witness-box. Rather, on his behalf, his grand father Sh. Kashmir Singh appeared in the witness-box as PW4 on the basis of Special Power of Attorney Ex.P15 in his favour. 17.It is testified by said PW4 Sh. Kashmir Singh that his grand son Sanampreet Singh suffered grievous injuries in the accident on 13.09.2014 but said Sanampreet Singh has now left for Australia for further studies. PW4 deposed about the manner of accident and the accidental injuries caused to Sanampreet Singh and Harmanpreet Singh. He also deposed that Sanampreet Singh was taken to Civil Hospital, Ambala from the spot of accident, from where he was referred to GMCH Sector-32, Chandigarh and then shifted to Fortis Hospital, Mohali, where he remained admitted as an indoor patient from 13.09.2014 to 07.10.2014. PW4 deposed further that an amount of 10 lacs has been spent by him ₹ on medicines, besides transportation, special diet etc. for treatment of Sanampreet Singh. He further deposed that doctors at Fortis Hospital, Mohali had operated upon the right leg of his grand son, which was totally crushed in the accident. His skin grafting was also done of the (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page No. 6 of 14 Pages) Dated: 21.07.2016. MACP No.41 of 2015 Sanampreet Singh Vs. Kuldeep Singh etc. MACP No.42 of 2015 Harmanpreet Singh Vs. Kuldeep Singh etc. injured bone and other parts of the body. He further deposed that his grand son has become permanently disabled. Said Sanampreet Singh was 18 years old at the time of accident and due to the injuries, his future prospects have become bleak. It is also deposed that his grand son had to leave for Australia for further studies and that an amount of 8,27,580/- ₹ deposited by him on behalf of his grand son was forfeited by the University Perth Institute of Business and Technology, Australia as Sanampreet Singh could not join the classes in time and lost one semester. Besides, he also suffered loss of the Air ticket, which lapsed causing huge loss. PW4 deposed that his grand son had left for Australia in the month of February 2015 and is still there for his studies. PW4 further deposed that he himself suffered loss of 50,000/-, which he could earn by serving ₹ in a private company, as he remained as attendant for his injured grand son Sanampreet Singh. PW4 also placed on record documents Ex.P15 and Ex.P16, besides Mark A to Mark Z and Mark AB. 18.During cross-examination, PW4 disclosed that he is not a witness to the accident. He has no proof regarding forfeiture of fees or the Air ticket or spoiling of the academic session of his grand son Sanampreet Singh. He further disclosed that Sanampreet Singh had gone to Australia alone in February 2015 on study VISA. He pleaded ignorance about the original of bills Mark A to Mark Z and Mark AB, stating that the bills produced before the Court were issued by Fortis Hospital and that he had made the payment in Fortis Hospital in cash. He admits that the payment was made against proper receipt at the cash counter, but he does not have in his possession the original bills issued by Fortis Hospital, except which have been filed in the Court. PW4 did not deny and only pleaded ignorance that his grand son Sanampreet Singh was having Medi-claim policy but denied the suggestion that the original bills have not been produced as the compensation has already been obtained against those bills from other sources. 19.It is important to notice that neither any doctor from Civil Hospital, Ambala City, where Sanampreet Singh was initially taken nor (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page No. 7 of 14 Pages) Dated: 21.07.2016. MACP No.41 of 2015 Sanampreet Singh Vs. Kuldeep Singh etc. MACP No.42 of 2015 Harmanpreet Singh Vs. Kuldeep Singh etc. any doctor from Fortis Hospital, Mohali, where petitioner Sanampreet Singh remained admitted as an indoor patient from 13.09.2014 to 07.10.2014, has been examined by the petitioner. Only one doctor from GMCH, Dr. Vishal Verma has been examined as PW3, who disclosed that Sanampreet Singh had been brought there with a history of roadside accident on 13.09.2014 and as per record, he had suffered two lacerated wounds – (1) in the right iliac crest region and (2) in right thigh. It is testified that the patient left the hospital on the same day against medical advice and at that time, his vitals were stable and that X-ray was not conducted to know that whether any operation or surgery was required. Dr. Vishal Verma proved treatment file consisting of 21 pages as Ex.P14. 20.Ex.P14 is the photo copy of the health record sheet pertaining to petitioner Sanampreet Singh, prepared at GMCH, Chandigarh. No treatment record or medical papers of Fortis Hospital, Mohali, have been produced, where Sanampreet Singh remained admitted, as per the case of the petitioner. 21.Further, all other documents relating to the expenses on medical treatment, placed on record are the photo copies. Mark A is the photo copy of bill issued by Fortis Hospital, as per which an amount of 5,97,405/- was paid. Mark B to Mark Z and Mark AB are photo copies₹ of various other bills, showing the purchase of medicines at Fortis Hospital, Mohali. 22.There is absolutely no explanation for not producing the original bills; prescriptions or the treatment record of Fortis Hospital. In these circumstances, the contention of learned counsel for respondent no.3 – insurance company contains force that it is very much possible that petitioner has got reimbursement from any other source like Medi-claim policy, where original bills might have been submitted and it is because of this reason that original bills have not been produced before this Tribunal and only photo copies have been produced. (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page No. 8 of 14 Pages) Dated: 21.07.2016. MACP No.41 of 2015 Sanampreet Singh Vs. Kuldeep Singh etc. MACP No.42 of 2015 Harmanpreet Singh Vs. Kuldeep Singh etc. 23.Considering the fact that PW4 Sh. Kashmir Singh is only the attorney of the petitioner, who has not been able to explain the cause for non-production of the original bills; the fact that Sanampreet Singh has himself not entered the witness-box, no reliance can be placed upon photo copies of bills Mark A to Mark Z and MarkAB, so as to grant compensation on account of medical expenses. These bills are rejected for grant of compensation. 24.Petitioner has also tendered in evidence Ex.P16, which is a bill issued by Singh Taxi Stand, in order to show the amount incurred on transportation for taking Sanampreet Singh to Fortis Hospital, Mohali from Banur, on different dates. Said bill is for 17,000/-. ₹ 25.Having regard to the above-said bill Ex.P16, the nature of injuries sustained by Sanampreet Singh, as disclosed by PW3 Dr. Vishal Verma and as find mention in Ex.P14, an amount of 40,000/-₹ is allowed towards all general expenses, which must have been incurred by the petitioner either towards transportation charges or towards special diet, attendant etc. 26.There is no reliable evidence, except bald statement made by PW4, the attorney of petitioner, about loss of study or air ticket or forfeiture of fee at Australia and so, plea of compensation in this regard is rejected. Photographs Mark AA, BB and CC placed on file by ld. Counsel for the petitioner, at the stage of arguments, don't advance the petitioner in any manner, as these photographs don't prove that skin grafting was done due to accidental injuries; nor there is evidence that these photographs are of the petitioner. 27.Having regard to the nature of injuries, it can also be assumed that petitioner must have suffered lot of pain and agony during his hospitalization and treatment, for which an amount of 25,000/- is ₹ allowed as compensation. (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page No. 9 of 14 Pages) Dated: 21.07.2016. MACP No.41 of 2015 Sanampreet Singh Vs. Kuldeep Singh etc. MACP No.42 of 2015 Harmanpreet Singh Vs. Kuldeep Singh etc. 28.Thus,petitioner Sanampreet Singh is held entitled to total compensation of 65,000/-, as per the following details:- ₹ Sr. No. Head of compensation Amount. 1. Compensation on account of transportation, special diet and attendant etc. 40₹,000-00 2.

Claimant of this petition namely, Harmanpreet Singh examined as PW1 testified about the accidental injuries sustained by him. As per him, from the spot of accident, he was taken to General Hospital, Ambala, from where, he was shifted to Gian Sagar Hospital,Banur, where he remained admitted for sufficient time. It is further claimed that he spent an amount of 02 lacs on his treatment, including medicines, ₹ transportation etc. During cross-examination, PW1 disclosed that he has completed his B. Com. Initially, he got treatment from Fortis Hospital, Mohali, but main treatment was taken from Gian Sagar Hospital, Banur. He did not go for any surgery as his treatment was conservatory. He does not have any proof regarding taking of special diet etc. Ex.P5 to Ex.P12 are only receipts of the amount spent by him on his treatment. He also disclosed that he did not remain admitted in Gian Sagar Hospital, Banur and was discharged on the same day. 30. Ex.P1 to Ex.P3 are OPD cards issued by Gian Sagar Medical College & Hospital, Rajpura, pertaining to petitioner Harmanpreet Singh, revealing that petitioner attended the said hospital on different dates for treatment. Ex.P4 reveals that he had suffered fracture in his right wrist. Ex.P5 to Ex.P12 are various receipts showing the amount incurred on his treatment. It may be noted here itself that the amount mentioned in Ex.P6 (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page No. 10 of 14 Pages) Dated: 21.07.2016 . MACP No.41 of 2015 Sanampreet Singh Vs. Kuldeep Singh etc. MACP No.42 of 2015 Harmanpreet Singh Vs. Kuldeep Singh etc. to Ex.P8 is covered under Ex.P5. These documents reveal that an amount of 4841/- was spent by the petitioner on his treatment. There is no other₹ document to show incurring any other expenses on treatment. 31.Having regard to the documents placed on record, an amount of 5000/- is allowed to petitioner Harmanpreet Singh to compensate him₹ for medical expenses. 32.In addition to above, an amount of 10,000/- is allowed as ₹ compensation to petitioner as general expenses like transportation, special diet etc., if any. Another amount of 10,000/- is allowed to the petitioner ₹ to compensate him for pain and sufferings, which he had to face during his treatment. This way, petitioner Harmanpreet Singh is held entitled to total compensation of 25,000/-, as per the following details:- ₹ Sr. No. Head of compensation Amount. 1. Compensation on account of medical expenses. 5₹,000-00 2. Compensation on account pain and sufferings during the period of treatment 10₹ ,000-00 2. Compensation on account transportation and special diet etc. 10₹ ,000-00 Total 25₹,000-00 33. Ex.R4 is the insurance policy, which reveals that the offending vehicle was duly insured in the name of respondent 2 with respondent no.3 for the period from 12.10.2013 to 11.10.2014, which period covers the date of accident. As such, it is held that all the three respondents being driver, owner and insurer of the offending vehicle are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the petitioners, as has been assessed above. Issue no.2 is accordingly, decided. ISSUE NO.3: 34. Ex.R1 is the copy of the driving licence in the name of respondent Kuldeep, purported to have been issued by District Transport (Deepak Gupta) MACT, Ambala (Page No. 11 of 14 Pages) Dated: 21.07.2016 .

Shri RK Joshi, counsel for respondents no.1 and 2. Shri Mohinder Bindal, counsel for respondent no.3. JUDGMENT:- 1.This consolidated judgment of mine shall dispose of above mentioned two claim petitions, having arisen out of the same motor vehicular accident, which had taken place on 12.11.2014. 2.Shri Ram, the claimant/petitioner has filed the present claim (Devinder Singh), Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ambala. 16.07.2016 . SHRI RAM VERSUS RAJINDER & ORS. -3- petition (MACT Case No. 182 of 2015) for grant of compensation to the tune of Rs.6 Lac on account of injuries suffered by him in motor vehicular accident which had taken place on 12.11.2014. 3.The brief facts as per the claim petition are that on 12.11.2014, Shri Ram, the claimant/injured along with Jai Pal was coming after taking medicine for son of Jai Pal from village Mohri by driving Motor cycle Make Splendor bearing registration no.HR-01-AA- 0956 towards village Mohra on his correct left side of the road on a moderate speed to take the medicine. At about 10.30 a.m. when the claimant reached near Kumar Swami Ashram, Mohri, G.T. Road,mean time a Ford Figo Car bearing registration No.HR-26-BT-4268 of white colour being driven by the respondent no.1 in a rash and negligent manner came from behind i.e. Shahabad side and hit the motor cycle of the claimant from behind. As a result of which claimant suffered multiple injuries on his whole body. The accident took place due to the sole rash driving of respondent no.1. who was driving his Ford Figo Car bearing registration no.HR-26-BT-4268 of white colour in rash and negligent manner and struck the same against the motor cycle of the claimant and the claimant fell own and suffered injures. It is further averred that a criminal case bearing FIR No.441 dated 15-11.2014 under Sections 279/337 IPC has been registered against driver of the offending vehicle with the police of police station Shahabad. The claimant/injured was taken to the civil Hospital Ambala Cantt and after that he was referred to PGI Chandigarh.The claimant was also got examined at Triniti Hospital (Devinder Singh), Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ambala. 16.07.2016 . SHRI RAM VERSUS RAJINDER & ORS. -4- and Medical Institute, Zirakpur, medical tests were taken there and after that he was taken to the PGI Chandigarh on 12.11.2014 and on 13.11.2014 the claimant was operated at PGI Chandgiarh and remained admitted at PGI Chandigarh till 27.11.2014 and was discharged on 27.11.2014. Again the claimant was admitted in PGI Chandigarh on 21.04.2015 and was operated on 02.05.2015. The treatment is still going on and the claimant has spent more than Rs.Two lacs upon his treatments, operation, medicines, special diet, special nursing care and transportation and on his treatment till date. The claimant/injured was in good health and was free from any ailment/disability before this accident. The claimant suffered a lot of pain, suffering and bed confinement for seven months due to this accident. It is further pleaded that the aforesaid accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of car bearing registration no.HR-26-BT-4268 by Rajinder Kumar, the respondent no.1. Hence, respondent no.1 being driver, respondent no. 2 being owner and respondent no.3 being insurer of the aforesaid truck are jointly and severally liable to pay an amount of Rs.6 Lac as compensation to the claimant alongwith interest at the rate of 18% per annum from the date of filing petition till realisation . 4.The second claim petition ( MACT Case No.331 of 2015 ) has been filed by claimant on account of injuries suffered by him in the same accident. He has claimed compensation to the tune of Rs.5 lacs on account of injuries suffered by him in aforementioned accident. It has been pleaded by the claimant/injured that he had received multiple (Devinder Singh), Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ambala. 16.07.2016 . SHRI RAM VERSUS RAJINDER & ORS. -5- injuries and fracture on his left leg in the aforementioned accident, he was taken to Civil Hospital, Ambala City wherein he remained admitted till 15.11.2014. It is further averred that treatment is still going on and claimant spent more than Rs.5,00,000/- on his treatment, died transportation etc. till date and became permanently disabled due to in the injures suffered in the above road side accident. It is further averred that the said accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of Car bearing registration no. HR-26-BT-4268 by Rajinder Kumar, the respondent no.1. Hence, respondent no.1 being driver, respondent no. 2 being owner and respondent no.3 being insurer of the aforesaid care are jointly and severally liable to pay an amount of Rs.5 Lac as compensation to the claimant alongwith interest at the rate of 18% per annum from the date of filing petition till realisation . 5.The claim petition has been contested by respondents no.1 and 2 by filing joint written statement. In their written statement, respondents no.1 and 2 have averred that the respondent no.1 has not made the accident. Rather accident occurred due to sole negligence of the claimant. However, a false case under section 279/337 IPC has been registered against the car driver by the police of police Station Shahabad. It is further averred that the claimant himself was negligent in causing the accident and in connivance with the local police a false case has been registered against the respondent no.1 and the car was falsely involved in this accident. Also controverting other allegations, prayer for dismissal of the claim petitions has been made. (Devinder Singh), Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ambala. 16.07.2016 . SHRI RAM VERSUS RAJINDER & ORS. -6- 6. In its written statement filed by respondent no.3, it is averred that no accident as alleged had taken place with alleged car bearing registration no.HR-26BT-4268, however, it seems and proves from the facts of this case that the present claim petition has been filed in collusion with respondent no.1 &2 just to extract compensation from the answering respondent by falsely impleading the said vehicle in the present case on flimsy grounds after four days of the alleged occurrence by introducing and managing false evidence and witnesses. It is averred that the alleged car bearing registration no.HR-26BT-4268 was not insured with the respondent i.e.Tata AIG General Insurance Co. Ltd. on the alleged date of accident i.e. on 12.11.2014 as alleged in the present petition. The alleged driver of alleged vehicle was not having a valid and effective driving licnece at the time of alleged accident and was driving his alleged car in violation of the terms and condition of the alleged insurance policy, if any. It is averred that the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation since the claimant suffered the alleged injuries only due to sole rash and negligent driving of the motor cycle no.HR-01AA-0956 by its driver. Also controverting other allegations, prayer for dismissal of the claim petition has been made. 7.It is pertinent to mention here that in order to avoid conflicting judgments, claim petition no. 331 of 2015 titled as “Jai Pal Vs. Rajinder Kumar and others ” was ordered to be consolidated with petition no. 182 of 2015 titled as “Shri Ram Vs. Rajinder Kumar and others” vide order dated 0.8.01.2016 and the proceedings were (Devinder Singh), Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ambala. 16.07.2016 . SHRI RAM VERSUS RAJINDER & ORS. -7- ordered to be recorded in claim petition no. 182 of 2015 as “Shri Ram Vs. Rajinder Kumar and others” . 8.From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed for adjudication on 25.9.2012:- 1.Whether any accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of Ford Figo Car bearing registration no.HR-26-BT- 4268 by respondent no.1 causing injuries to Shri Ram and Jai Pal, the claimants as alleged? OPP. 2.If issue no.1 is proved, the to what amount of compensation to the claimants are entitled to and from whom?OPP. 3.Whether the respondent no.3 is not liable to pay anycompensation, in view of hte breach the Insurance Co. is not liable to pay any compensation on account of preliminary objections raised in the written statement? OPR. 4.Relief. (Perusal of claim petition shows that Car no. HR-26 BT- 4268. However, at the time of framing issue no.1 inadvertantly Car no. HR-26 BT- 4286 and the same be read as HR-26 BT- 4268). 9.In order to substantiate their case, the claimant-petitioner has examined Ahlmad Krishan Kumar as PW1, Dr. Sumit Kukreja, MO as PW2, Jai Pal as PW3 and Shir Ram as PW4 and thereafter, learned counsels for the claimants closed his evidence vide statement dated 23.5.2016. 10.On the other hand, respondents no. 1 and 2 tender documents Ex. R1 to Ex. R3 and thereafter, closed their evidence vide separate statement dated 30.5.2016. Learned counsel for the respondent no.3 closed his evidence vide separate statement dated 11.7.2016. 11.Arguments have been addressed by the learned counsel for (Devinder Singh), Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ambala. 16.07.2016 . SHRI RAM VERSUS RAJINDER & ORS. -8- the parties and the records have also been perused. My issue-wise findings are as under:- Issues No. 1 & 2:- 12. Both these issues are interconnected, hence are being taken up together for adjudication. To prove these issues, injured/claimants have examined PW1 and PW2. Injured Jai Pal has appeared as PW3 while injured Shri Ram has appeared as PW4. The accident in question took place on 15.11.2014, whereas FIR in the present case has been registered vide FIR no.441 dated 15.11.2014 under section 279/337/338 IPC. Perusal of the FIR shows that in the proceedings of the police it is mentioned the accident took place on account of rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1 i.e. driver of Car bearing registration no. HR-26 BT- 4268. The claimant has produced seizure memo of Car no. HR-26 BT- 4268 , RC, DL and Insurance Ex. P1. As per RC Rajinder Kumar son of Hans Raj is owner of Car HR-26 BT- 4268. The complainant has also produced release order dated 22.12.2014 Ex. P2 of Car no. HR-26 BT- 4268. Car no. HR-26 BT- 4268 is insured with the respondent no.3 and insurance is valid from 25.6.2014 to 24.6.2015. Certified copy of report under section 173 Cr.P.C. is Ex. P23. However, in the FIR vehicle no. HR-26 BT- 4286 is inadvertently mentioned. 13. The injured and the eye-witness have also deposed in the witness box and while the respondents have not any evidence to rebut the evidence of the claimant and the respondents have only relied upon documents Ex. R1 to Ex. R3. Even otherwise, it is observed by the (Devinder Singh), Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ambala. 16.07.2016 . SHRI RAM VERSUS RAJINDER & ORS. -9- Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Smt. Surinder Kaur and others Versus Lakhbir Singh and another 2007(1) PLR 494 that; “F.I.R.-Being a public document is admissible in evidence as such and if no objection is raised at the time of production thereof, the same is to be read in evidence.” Similar view was held by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Bansi Yadav and another Versus Krishan Kumar and another 2004(3) ACC 758.Reliance General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Anita Devi (P&H) : Law Finder Doc Id # 414183 2013(2) RCR(Civil) 160, wherein it held that mentioning of wrong registration of vehicle in FIR not a fatal defect and the vehicle number was not scribed by the person who noted down and it was conveyed by a totally illiterate person for the purpose of recording the first information report. There is every chance for furnishing a wrong number is the FIR. 14. Keeping in view the principle laid down in authorities (Supra), it becomes clear that the FIR being a public document and when not rebutted is to be considered as true. It is also important to note that the proceedings in MACT cases are of summary nature and the case is not to be proved like civil case where case is to be proved from the point of preponderance of probabilities or in criminal case, where charge is to be proved beyond shadows of doubt. The FIR has been registered against the respondent no.1. So, in view of law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993(2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008(2) R.C.R. (civil) 774, it can be safely held that the (Devinder Singh), Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ambala. 16.07.2016 . SHRI RAM VERSUS RAJINDER & ORS. -10- accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of Car bearing registration No.HR-26 BT- 4268 by respondent no.1. Accordingly, issue no.1 is decided in favour of the petitioner. ISSUE No.2:- 15.The onus of proving this issue was on the petitioner and to prove the same it was argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that in the accident in question serious injuries were caused to the petitioner Shri Ram, who spent substantial amount on his treatment, which has been deposed by him in the witness box and his medico legal record on account of treatment is Ex. P- 234, 235, and medical bills are Ex. P-3 to Ex. P-185 and Ex. P- 230. That the petitioner is accordingly entitled to compensation in the present case. It was argued that the injuries of the petitioner are to be seen and non-production of medical bills were was not a ground to reject the evidence for which reliance was placed upon the principles laid down in Nesamony Transport Corporation Limited Vs. Chenthilathiapan & Anr., 2000(1) ACC 332. Similar view was held in Deepak Verma Vs. Naresh Kumar & Ors., 2013(4) Law Herald 3115 . 16.Learned counsel for respondents meanwhile argued that in the absence of any medical bills produced by the petitioner Jai Pal, he was not entitled to any compensation in the present case. 17.I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record carefully. (Devinder Singh), Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ambala. 16.07.2016 . SHRI RAM VERSUS RAJINDER & ORS. -11- 18.PW3 has deposed on account of accident and he has specifically stated that he had suffered injuries due to sole rash and negligent driving of car by its driver. He took treatment from Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt. He has no bill of treatment or expenses incurred thereupon. He has not proof of income. He is doing daily activities. 19. PW4 has stated that he has no proof of occupation, profession and income. He has two sons and they are residing at village Pharouli. He has no proof about confinement to bed for any time due to alleged injuries. He took treatment from PGI, Chandigarh and payments in PGI made against proper receipts. He has not availed any reimbursement against his treatment from any other source. He had purchased medicine from market. Now, he can walk without any support or help. 20.Medical record of injured Shri Ram Ex. P-3 to Ex. P-185 and Ex. P- 230 shows the injuries suffered by him and the petitioner has deposed regarding spending substantial amount on his treatment. After accident he was shifted to the Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt and thereafter he was referred to PGI Chandigarh. The claimant also examined at Triniti Hospital and Medical Institute, Zirakpur. He was taken to PGI Chandigarh on 12.11.2014 and on 13.11.2014 he was operated at PGI Chandigarh and remained admitted in PGI Chandigarh and discharged on 27.11.2014 and against operated on 25.04.2014 and discharged on 2.5.2015 and he used to visit PGI in Taxi and has produced bills of Taxi Ex.

While providing necessary particulars as required under the Motor Vehicles Act and the Rules thereunder, the claimants inter-alia averred that on 07 .07.2015, Rekha alias Vidhi alongwith her husband was coming from Kurukshetra to Ambala in their Toyota Etios Car bearing registration No.HR26Z/0002, being driven by her husband at moderate speed on correct side of the road and when they were at 2-3 kilometers from Ambala Cantt, truck bearing registration no.HR68A/0433 came from behind rashly and negligently in zig-zag manner, without blowing any horn and hit their car, resultantly, her husband lost control over the car.

VINOD KUMAR & OTHERS VERSUS AMRIK SINGH & OTHERS 3 It is further averred that accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 while driving truck bearing registration no.HR68A/0433. It is further averred that FIR no.170 dated 07.07.2015 for commission of offences punishable under Sections 279 and 304-A IPC was registered in Police Station Parao, District Ambala on the statement of Vinod Kumar. It is further averred that Smt. Rekha Rani alias Vidhi (now deceased), aged 35 years, was employed as Administrative Officer in Shri Balaji Education Trust, Pundri, District Kaithal, thereby getting Rs.25,000/- as salary per month and besides this, she was also having income from agricultural land and thus, monthly income of Rekha Rani (now deceased) was Rs.45,000/-. It is further averred that due to death of Rekha, claimants have suffered great loss, love and affection, pain and agony, they being fully dependent upon her. It is further averred that Rekha (now deceased) used to perform all her duties and due to her death, future prospects of claimants have become dark. It is further averred that Rekha (now deceased) used to hand over her entire income to claimant no.1 for household expenses. It is further averred that Rs.40,000/- were spent on transportation, funeral and last rites. Claimant no.1 being husband and claimants no.2 and 3 being minor children, of the deceased, claimed compensation to the tune of Rs.55,00,000/- alongwith interest at the rate of 18% per annum from the date of accident till realization. It is prayed that respondent no.1 being VINOD KUMAR & OTHERS VERSUS AMRIK SINGH & OTHERS 4 driver, respondent no.2 being owner, whereas respondent no.3 being insurer, of vehicle in question, be held liable to pay compensation jointly and severally. 3.Upon notice, respondents no.1 and 2 appeared and filed joint written statement to the effect that accident occurred due to negligence of driver of car, wherein Rekha (now deceased) was travelling, who struck his car against truck in question. It is further submitted that false and frivolous case had been got registered against respondent no.1. It is further submitted that income of Rekha (now deceased) shown in petition is exaggerated and amount spent on deceased is also shown exaggerated and that claimants were not dependent on deceased. Denying all other averments, dismissal of petition was prayed for. 4.On notice, respondent no.3 appeared and filed written statement raising preliminary objections to the effect that petition is ex- facie misconceived, vexatious, untenable and devoid of merits. It is further averred that from the petition as well as from FIR, no case is made out against answering respondent. It is further averred that no accident, as alleged, had occurred due to negligent driving of truck in question and it seems that petition has been filed in collusion with respondents no.1 and 2 just to extract compensation. It is further averred that since truck in question was not insured with answering respondent on alleged date, answering respondent is not liable to indemnify the owner of said vehicle. It is further averred that even if alleged accident is presumed to have occurred, though not admitted, even then answering respondent is not VINOD KUMAR & OTHERS VERSUS AMRIK SINGH & OTHERS 5 liable to pay any compensation, since Rekha (now deceased) suffered alleged injuries due to sole rash and negligent driving of car in question. Preliminary objections qua cause of action and respondent no.1 not holding valid and effective driving licence were also taken. On merits, age, occupation and income of deceased are denied. It is further submitted that answering respondent has wrongly been impleaded. Denying all other averments, dismissal of petition was prayed for. 5.Replication was not filed. From pleadings of parties, following issues were framed: 1.Whether the accident in question took place by rash and negligent driving of truck bearing registration No.HR68A/0433 by respondent no.1 resulting into death of Rekha @ Vidhi as alleged? OPP 2.If issue no.1 is proved, then whether claimants are entitled to compensation, if so, how much and from whom? OPP 3.Whether respondent no.1 was driving offending vehicle in violation of terms and conditions of insurance policy, if so, its effect? OPR-3 4.Relief 6.In order to prove the case, petitioner Vinod Kumar himself appeared as PW1 and examined Rajesh Kumar, Accounts Clerk in the office of Sh. Balaji & Educational Trust, Kurukshetra Road, Fatehpur VINOD KUMAR & OTHERS VERSUS AMRIK SINGH & OTHERS 6 Pundri, District Kaithal as PW2. In documentary evidence, documents Ex.P17 to Ex.P25 were tendered. 7.On the other hand, respondents did not lead any oral evidence. However, learned counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 tendered documents Mark-A to Mark-D. 8.No rebuttal evidence was led. 9.After due consideration of the arguments and evidence of both parties, the findings on the above issues along with reasons for the decision are given below: Issue no.1: 10.Burden to prove this issue was upon petitioners. In order to prove the case, petitioner Vinod Kumar himself stepped as PW1. In his affidavit Ex.PW1/A, he deposed that on 07.07.2015, he along with his wife Rekha alias Vidhi (now deceased) was coming from Kurukshetra to Ambala in his Toyota Etios Car bearing registration No.HR26Z/0002 and he was driving the car at moderate speed. He further deposed that at about 10.10 AM, when they reached 2-3 kilometers prior to Ambala Cantt, truck bearing registration no.HR68A/0433 came from behind rashly and negligent in zig-zag manner without blowing any horn and hit their car, resultantly, he lost control over the car and accident took place. He further deposed that Rekha Rani alias Vidhi suffered serious injuries and died at GMCH, Sector 32, Chandigarh, where postmortem on the body was conducted. He further deposed that he also received multiple, grievous injuries. He further deposed that accident occurred due to sole rash and VINOD KUMAR & OTHERS VERSUS AMRIK SINGH & OTHERS 7 negligent driving of driver of truck bearing registration no.HR68A/0433. PW1 was cross examined at length, but there is nothing on record, on which basis he can be disbelieved. 11.With regard to the accident, FIR No.170 dated 07.07.2015 for commission of offences punishable under Sections 279, 304-A IPC Ex.P1 was registered in P.S. Parao, District Ambala. On perusal of FIR Ex.P1, it is clear that registration number of the truck in question is specifically mentioned in the FIR and FIR was immediately registered. 12. Respondent no.1 was the best witness, but for the reasons best known to him, he opted not to step in the witness box. Similarly, respondent no.2 was having an opportunity to say that vehicle has been falsely implicated, but he also opted not to step in the witness box. It is admitted fact that truck no.HR68A/0433 was taken in possession by police from the spot on the same day, so it can not be a case of false implication of the vehicle. 13.Considering the above discussion, this Tribunal is of the view that claimants have successfully proved that accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing registration no. HR68A/0433 by respondent no.1 and Rekha alias Vidhi died due to injuries suffered in the accident. Hence, Issue no.1 is decided in favour of claimants. Issue no.2 & 3: 14.In present case, compensation has been claimed by claimants on account of death of Rekha alias Vidhi, wife of claimant no.1 and mother of claimants no.2 and 3. It is pleaded in the petition that she was VINOD KUMAR & OTHERS VERSUS AMRIK SINGH & OTHERS 8 earning Rs.25,000/- per month. Claimant no.1 appeared as PW1 and in his affidavit Ex.PW1/A, he deposed that his wife was employed as Administrative Officer in Balaji Education Trust College at Pundri, District Kaithal and was earning Rs.25,000/- per month and was also having income from agricultural land and thus, total income of deceased was Rs.45,000 to 50,000/- per month. 15. In order to prove employment of the deceased, claimants examined Rajesh Kumar, Accounts Clerk in the office of Balaji & Educational Trust (Regd.), Kurukshetra Road, Fatehpur Pundri, District Kaithal, who brought the summoned record pertaining to Rekha Rani, deceased and deposed that Rekha Rani was working as Administrative Officer in their College and was getting salary of Rs.25,000/- per month. This witness placed on record attested copy of joining letter of deceased Rekha as Ex.P3, salary certificate for the financial year 2014-15 of deceased Rekha as Ex.P4, salary certificate for the financial year 2013-14 of deceased Rekha as Ex.P5, salary account statement of deceased Rekha Rani for the period 01.04.2012 to 31.03.2013 as Ex.P6, salary statements for the financial year 01.04.2013 to 31.03.2014, 01.04.2014 to 31.03.2015, 01.04.2015 to 31.03.2016 as Ex.P7 to Ex.P9 respectively, copies of Form 16 for the financial year 2012-2013, 2013-14 and 2014-15 as Ex.P10 to Ex.P12 respectively. He also placed on record income tax return for the financial year 2012-13, 2013-14 & 2014-15 as Ex.P13 to Ex.P15 respectively and photocopy of attendance register for the period Oct. 2014 to July, 2015 of Rekha Rani (now deceased) as Ex.P16. VINOD KUMAR & OTHERS VERSUS AMRIK SINGH & OTHERS 9 16.Firstly coming to income of Rekha Rani (deceased). It is the case of claimants that she was serving as Administrative Officer in S.B. Institute of Engineering and Technology, run by Shri Balaji Educational Trust, Kaithal. In order to show her appointment, PW2 placed on record copy of appointment letter dated 9.9.2010 Ex.P3, from which it is clear that she was appointed for one year and her appointment was contractual in nature. Her tenure of one year was from the date of joining. On perusal of Ex.P3, this Tribunal is of the view that this document has been prepared to support the case of claimants to prove income of Rekha Rani (deceased). It does not bear signature of the then President/Chairman of the Trust and it bears signature of Rekha Rani, which itself creates doubt. The document was allegedly produced from record of the College and as such, there was no occasion to get signature of Rekha Rani and it is clear that this signature was not against receipt of appointment letter. On comparing signature of Rekha Rani on Ex.P3 with signature on Ex.P17, this Tribunal is of the view that signature on Ex.P3 is not of Rekha Rani. PW2 has admitted in his cross-examination that Bank had taken possession of the Institution and lateron, third party took possession of the Institution. He deposed that he had left the job in March, 2014, from which it can be inferred that there was no occasion with PW2 for having the record of College. He deposed that he did not know the present owner of the Institution. 17.On perusal of income tax return for financial year 2014-15 Ex.P15, it is clear that same has been filed on 17.6.2016 and this Tribunal VINOD KUMAR & OTHERS VERSUS AMRIK SINGH & OTHERS 10 is of the view that claimants tried their level best to prove that she was having earning as salary from the College, however it is clear from record of the College and other documents produced on record that record is contradictory. On perusal of Form 16 for the period 1.4.2014 to 31.3.2015 (regarding which ITR Ex.P15 was filed), it is clear that TDS was deducted on 8.3.2016 and 17.6.2016 and same creates doubt. TDS, if any, was required to be deducted at the time of releasing of the salary, if the salary comes within purview of income tax, however Rs.8810/- was deposited on 8.3.2016 and Rs.250/- was deducted on 17.10.2016. As per settled procedure, an employer is required to deposit TDS deducted from the salary of an employee monthly with the Bank and to file quarterly statement in this regard. Otherwise also, the TDS deducted is on higher side and same has been deducted just to show that TDS was deducted from the salary. The TDS deducted does not match with the taxable income of Rekha. Rekha died on 7.7.2015 and there was no reason to deposit TDS, by showing that TDS was deducted from her salary, on 8.3.2016 and 17.6.2016. This Tribunal is of the view that all these documents have been prepared just to show her income on higher side. 18.PW2 has tendered all the documents regarding her salary, account statements and salary statements and even ITRs of Rekha. This Tribunal is of the view that there was no occasion for PW2 to keep even the ITRs of Rekha, which was even filed after her death. It is clear from documents Ex.P6 to Ex.P8 that in all ledger accounts and salary statements, name of Rekha Rani is not mentioned in the list of employees. VINOD KUMAR & OTHERS VERSUS AMRIK SINGH & OTHERS 11 Statement of bank account of Rekha has not been placed on record to show that any salary was received in said account. 19.Considering record of the case, certificates Ex.P4 and Ex.P5 issued regarding salary drawn by Rekha Rani are also doubtful. Her name is not included in any of the salary statements/account statement Ex.P6 to Ex.P8, wherein names of all employees are mentioned. So, this Tribunal is of the view that record produced by claimants in support of their claim regarding employment, is not believable and has been prepared to show her as employed as Administrative Officer, so as to get higher compensation. 20.Accordingly, it is held that her income can not be assessed on the basis of documents produced by claimants and in such circumstances, her income can be assessed by taking her as a housewife. The value of the services of a housewife cannot be quantified easily as she plays different roles in relation to different persons and also performs the domestic work. Thus, considering her as housewife, her income is assessed as Rs.6000/- per month and as per settled law, no deduction is required to be made on the pretext of personal expenses, if income has been considered by taking the values of services by a housewife. So, claimants suffered a loss of Rs.72,000/- per annum (6000 x 12) and so, loss of income is considered as Rs.72,000/- per annum. 21.As per Matriculation Examination Certificate Ex.P19 of Rekha Rani (now deceased), her Date of Birth is 02.01.1980 and accident in question occurred on 07.07.2015, so her age was more than 35 years on VINOD KUMAR & OTHERS VERSUS AMRIK SINGH & OTHERS 12 the date of her death. Considering her age, multiplier of '15' is to be applied and on applying the same, total loss of dependency comes to Rs.10,80,000/-. Accordingly, Rs.10,80,000/- is awarded under the head of loss of dependency. In addition to the amount awarded above, Rs.1,00,000/- is awarded under the head of loss of consortium to petitioner no.1, whereas Rs.50,000/- each is awarded in favour of petitioner no.2 and 3 on account of loss of love and affection, as they have lost their mother. Rs.25,000/- is awarded to claimants under the head of last rites. 22.In total, total compensation of Rs.13,05,000/- is awarded in favour of claimants. 23.Now the question arises, who is liable to pay compensation to claimants. Admittedly, truck bearing registration no.HR68A/0433 was insured with respondent no.3 on the date of the accident. Hence, all respondents are held jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation amount. Issue no.2 is decided accordingly. 24.Burden to prove issue no.3 was upon respondent no.3- Insurance Company, but neither any evidence was led nor this issue was pressed. Hence, this issue is decided against respondent no.3. Relief: 25.In view of above discussion and findings on the issues, the claim petition is partly allowed. A sum of Rs.13,05,000/- is awarded in favour of petitioners. Petitioners shall also get interest on the awarded amount at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of institution of the VINOD KUMAR & OTHERS VERSUS AMRIK SINGH & OTHERS 13 petition till payment. All petitioners shall get equal share in the amount awarded. 70% of the amount awarded in favour of petitioner no.1 shall be deposited in a nationalized bank in his name in shape of FDR for 5 years and rest of the amount of his share shall be released in cash. 100% of the amount awarded in favour of petitioner no.2 and 3 shall be deposited in a nationalized bank in their names in shape of FDRs till the date of attaining majority. Bank shall not sanction any loan against the FDRs. The amount awarded in this petition shall be deposited by the respondents by way of demand draft or cheque in name of petitioners. Petitioners are also entitled to costs of the petition. Counsel fee is assessed Rs.2,200/-. Memo of costs be prepared. File be consigned to record room.

J U D G E M E N T: This claim petition under Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act for grant of compensation on account of injuries sustained in a Motor vehicle accident, has been filed by the claimant. Jagjit Singh, MACT Hari Chand Vs. Akash Kaggra etc. 2 2)Brief facts of the claim petition are that on 30.04.2014 the injured Hari Chand was going towards his house on his bicycle from Sunder Nagar and at about 6.00 P.M. when the claimant reached near Naach Ghar, a motorcycle bearing registration No.HR-01-AF-6521 being driven by respondent no.1 in a very rash and negligent manner and at a high speed came from behind and hit the claimant, as a result of which the claimant fell down on the road and sustained grievous injuries. The injured was taken to Railway Hospital, Ambala Cantt from where he referred to PGI, Chandigarh but the injured was got admitted in Narain Hospital, Ambala City, where he remained admitted from 30.04.2014 to 04.05.2014 and the injured had spent more than Rs.1,00,000/- on his treatment, special diet etc. Matter was reported to the police and FIR was registered against respondent no.1. The accident has taken place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. Lastly, it was prayed that compensation amount to the tune of Rs.10,00,000/- be awarded to him on account of injuries sustained by him along with interest @ 18% per annum, from the date of filing of the petition till its realization, for which respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation. 3)The respondents No.1 and 2 being driver and owner of the offending vehicle filed joint written statement and denied the averments made in the petition and stated that no accident took place due to rash and Jagjit Singh, MACT Hari Chand Vs. Akash Kaggra etc. 3 negligent driving of respondent no.1, however, a false and frivolous FIR was registered against the respondent no.1 just to fetch the claim. All other material averments were denied and lastly prayed for dismissal of the petition. 4)Replication was not filed. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed :- 1.Whether the accident in question causing injuries to the claimant Hari Chand took place due to rash and negligent driving of motorcycle bearing registration No.HR-01AF-6521 by respondent no.1, as alleged? OPP. 2.If issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation the claimant is entitled to and from whom? OPP. 3.Relief. 5) In support of his case, claimant has examined Dr. Manisha Aggarwal as PW-1, Ram Shankar as PW-2, Dr. Sachin Jindal as PW-3, Kewal Krishan as PW-4, PW-6 Kachhu Ram and the claimant himself appeared in the witness box as PW-5. Besides oral evidence, the following documents were placed on record:- Ex.P-1 :Disability Certificate Ex.P-2 :letter Ex.P-3 :Salary record Ex.P-4 & P-5 :Sick Certificates Jagjit Singh, MACT Hari Chand Vs. Akash Kaggra etc. 4 Ex.P-6 :Salary Certificate Ex.P-7 to P-11 :Treatment record Ex.P-12 to P-27 :Medicine Bills and receipts Ex.P-27 :Charge Sheet Ex.P-28 :Report u/s 173 Cr.P.C.

Counsel for the petitioner closed the evidence. 6)On the other hand, the respondents have examined Kachhu Ram as RW-1, Ram Shankar as RW-2, Arun Kumar as RW-4 and respondent no.1 himself appeared in the witness box as RW-3. Besides oral evidence, the following documents were placed on record:- Ex.RW1/1 & 2 :Out Patient Record Ex.RW1/3 :Sick Memo Ex.RW1/4 :Sick & Fit Certificate Ex.RW1/5 :Rules Ex.RW2/1 & 2 :Seniority List Ex.RW2/3 :Letter dated 08.09.2015 Ex.RW4/1 to 10 :Statements of witnesses recorded in Criminal Case. 7)No evidence in rebuttal was led by the petitioner. 8)I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the material placed on record. My issue-wise finding are given as under:- ISSUE No.1:- Jagjit Singh, MACT Hari Chand Vs. Akash Kaggra etc. 6 9)The onus of proving this issue was on the petitioner and to prove the same, learned counsel for the petitioner argued that in the present case the petitioner on 30.04.2014 was going to his home on his bicycle and at 6:00 P.M. when he reached near Naach Ghar a motorcycle bearing registration No.HR-01-AF-6521 driven by respondent no.1 came in a rash and negligent manner and hit the petitioner resulting in serious injuries to him. The petitioner lateron got the FIR registered since he was earlier unfit to make statement and the respondent no.1 is facing trial for the said case as per charge sheet Ex.P-27 and report under section 173 Cr.P.C., Ex.P-28. The FIR mentions the number of the offending vehicle and also the name of the respondent no.1 as the offending driver and this has also been deposed in the witness box by the petitioner himself. No rebuttal to this has come on the part of the respondents and it is clear that due to rash and negligent driving of his vehicle by the respondent no.1 the petitioner suffered serious injuries. 10)Learned counsel for the respondents meanwhile argued that a false claim petition has been filed by the petitioner and no accident was caused by the respondent no.1 as deposed by him in the witness box. The police had falsely implicated him in this case and the petition thus deserves dismissal. 11)I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have Jagjit Singh, MACT Hari Chand Vs. Akash Kaggra etc. 7 perused the file carefully. 12)The FIR registered in the present case Ex.P-49 mentions the manner in which the accident was caused and it also mentions the number of the offending vehicle being driven by the respondent no.1. The delay in lodging the FIR is explained in the FIR since the injured was unfit to make his statement earlier. The respondent no.1 is facing trial for the said offence before the trial court and charge has also been framed against him and he has not given any application to any senior official regarding his alleged false implication. Even otherwise, it is observed by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Smt. Surinder Kaur and others Versus Lakhbir Singh and another 2007(1) PLR 494 that; “F.I.R.-Being a public document is admissible in evidence as such and if no objection is raised at the time of production thereof, the same is to be read in evidence.” Similar view was held by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Bansi Yadav and another Versus Krishan Kumar and another 2004(3) ACC 758. Keeping in view the principle laid down in authorities (Supra), it becomes clear that the FIR being a public document and when not rebutted is to be considered as true. It is also important to note that the proceedings in Jagjit Singh, MACT Hari Chand Vs. Akash Kaggra etc. 8 MACT cases are of summary nature and the case is not to be proved like civil case where case is to be proved from the point of preponderance of probabilities or in criminal case, where charge is to be proved beyond shadows of doubt. The FIR has been registered against the respondent no.1. So, in view of law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993(2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008(2) R.C.R. (civil) 774, it can be safely held that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of motorcycle bearing registration No.HR-01AF-6521 by respondent no.1. Accordingly, issue no.1 is decided in favour of the petitioner. ISSUE No.2:- 13)The onus of proving this issue was on the petitioner and to prove the same it was argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner that in the accident in question the petitioner suffered serious injuries and initially remained admitted in Narain Hospital and then in PGI. The petitioner had to take leave of about 280 days and suffered loss and spent about Rs.1 lac on his treatment. He also suffered 40% disability as per Disability Certificate Ex.P-1 and same has also been deposed by PW-1, who proved the Disability Certificate. PW-2 proved the period of leave of the petitioner. PW-3 deposed regarding the treatment in Narain Hospital. PW-5 was the petitioner himself and PW-6 proved the record of Railway Jagjit Singh, MACT Hari Chand Vs. Akash Kaggra etc. 9 Hospital. It was thus argued that the petitioner is accordingly entitled to compensation in the present case. 14)Learned counsel for respondents meanwhile argued that the petitioner is not entitled to any compensation in the present case and the bills produced by him are on the higher side. The witnesses who have deposed clearly explained about no role of the respondent no.1 and even the CT Scan has not been brought on record. The doctor, PW-3 was never told by the petitioner as to how the accident had occurred and even as per the report of Motorcycle mechanic there is no damage to the motorcycle which was not possible in case the motorcycle had struck against the cycle of the petitioner. It was, therefore, argued that all these circumstances clearly show about no role of the respondent no.1 and the petitioner is not entitled to any compensation. 15)I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the record carefully. 16)As per witness PW-1, the petitioner has suffered 40% disability and the Disability Certificate is Ex.P-1 and this disability relates to the hearing of the petitioner.

Janak Raj & Another (hereinafter referred to as “First Petition”); claim petition No.07/MACT of 2015 titled as Sahab Singh Vs Janak Raj & Another (hereinafter referred to as “Second Petition”). Both the claim petitions have been preferred relating to one accident, out of them, first petition is for grant of compensation of Rs. 30,00,000/- on account of injuries suffered by claimant Sohan Lal and second petition is for grant of compensation of Rs.30,00,000/- on account of injuries suffered by claimant Sahab Singh, i n motor vehicular accident on 30.10.2014, which was allegedly caused due to rash and negligent driving of Truck bearing Registration No. HR-37-A-7707 by Janak Raj respondent No.1. At the relevant time, the vehicle in question was owned by the respondent no. 1 and was insured with the respondent no.2. 2The relevant facts leading to the claim petitions are that on 30.10.2014, Sohan Lal along with pillion riders Sahab Singh and Suresh SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 3 Kumar were going from Grain Market Ambala, to the house in village Saunti, while driving Motorcycle at slow speed and on the left side of the road. At about 10.00 PM, when they had gone little ahead from Thol Chowk, in the mean time, a truck bearing registration No. HR-37-A-7707 came at fast speed from Ismailabad side and while it was in the process of over taking, a canter came on the wrong side of the road and struck against their motorcycle. The truck was being driven by its driver at fast speed and in a rash and negligent manner by respondent No.1, resulting into causing serious injuries to claimant and others. They were taken to Government Hospital Ambala, from where both the claimants were referred to PGI Chandigarh. After causing the accident, respondent No.1 ran away from the side of accident leaving his truck at the spot. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing registration No. HR-37-A-7707 by respondent No.1. First claimant- Injured Sohan Lal remained admitted in PGI from 30.10.2014 to 08.12.2014 and has become permanently disabled. He spent Rs. three lac on his treatment and has spent Rs.50,000/- on transportation and special diet etc. He is earning Rs.15,000/- per month by doing the work of account and farming in Anaj Mandi Ambala City. Due to this accident, claimant will not be able to do his job throughout his life and has become totally disabled and handicapped. Prior to the accident, he was hale and hearty and due to his disability, he is dependent upon others for his livelihood. The accident took place due to sole rash and negligence of driver of Offending Truck bearing Registration No. HR-37-A-7707 . SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 4 3The second claim petition reveals the similar facts of accident as already elaborated and so far as her injuries are concerned; it is pleaded that soon after the accident, injured Sahab Singh was taken to General Hospital, Ambala City, from where, he was referred to PGI Chandigarh Cantt, where he remained admitted from 31.10.2014 to 10.11.2014. He has become 85 % permanent disabled. His right leg was amputated. He spent Rs.5,00,000/- on his treatment, medicines, transportation and diet etc. He cannot walk properly without the help of crutches. He feels great difficulty in climbing stairs etc. His working capacity has been diminished due to this accident . On the basis of statement of Sohan Lal, FIR No. 134 dated 31.10.2014 under section 279, 337 of IPC was registered in Police Station, Ismailabad, District Kurukshetra against the respondent No.1. Hence, both claim petitions have been filed with prayer that respondents are liable jointly and severally to pay compensation. 4Notice of these petitions were given to the respondents. The respondent no.1 filed written statement controverting the assertions made in the petitions. He took some preliminary objections like maintainability; claim petitions are bad for non joinder and mis joinder of necessary parties;; that the claimants have no cause of action or locus standi to file the petitions; that the claimants are estopped by their own act and conduct from filing the present petitions. On merit, it has been submitted that no accident had been occurred by the answering respondent with his vehicle on the alleged date, time and place. As a matter of fact, answering respondent and his vehicle have been wrongly implicated in said false FIR SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 5 by the police colluded with the claimants, therefore, the claimants are not entitled to any compensation and no liability can be imposed on answering respondent. Rest of averments made in the petition are denied with a prayer for dismissal of both the claim petition with costs. 5The respondent No. 2 insurance company filed separate written statement controverting the assertions made in the petition and took some preliminary objections regarding maintainability, cause of action; that the claim petitions are hit by the principles of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence; that the petitions are bad for non joinder of necessary parties and mis joinder of parties; that there is no insurable interest between insurer and insured; that the person driving the Truck No. HR- 37-A-7707 was not having a valid and effective driving licence at the time of the accident in violation of the terms and conditions of the alleged insurance policy; that the respondent reserves its right to take all defences and pleas available under section 148, 149 (2), 167,169 and 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and in terms of the insurance policy. On merit, it has been submitted that no record regarding alleged, occupation and income of the claimants has been placed on record. It is denied that claimants suffered serious and grievous injuries due to this accident and they remained admitted in any hospital due to th injuries suffered in the alleged accident and spent such huge amount on their medical treatment, transportation etc. The truck bearing registration No. HR-37-A-7707 was never involved in any accident, however, the insurance particular of the vehicle in question has not been verified from the issuing authority so SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 6 same is not admitted, but the liability of the insurance company, if any, subject to the provisions of the M.V . Act and also terms and conditions thereof. The amount claimed as compensation is much more exaggerated and imaginary one. It is denied that the claimants suffered serious and grievous injuries due to this accident and they remained admitted in any hospital due to the injuries suffered in the alleged accident. The actual cause of alleged accident has been suppressed; as such the answering respondent is not liable in any manner. The claim claimants have been filed after due consultation just to get compensation from the answering respondent on purely made up basis which is not sustainable in the eyes of law, so the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation. Rests of facts are denied and prayed for dismissal the petitions with special costs. 6Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following consolidated issues are framed vide order dated 14.05.2015:- 1.Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent of the respondent No.1 while driving Truck bearing Number HR-37-A-7707 resulting into causing injuries to Sohan Lal and Sahab Singh, as alleged?

OPR 5Whether the petitioners have not come to the court with clean hands and have suppressed true and SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 7 material facts from the court ? OPR 6Whether respondent No.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect ? OPR 7Whether petitions are bad for mis joinder and non joinder of necessary parties ? OPR 8Whether respondent No.2 is entitled to take all the defences available to it under the M.V .Act ? OPR 9Relief. 7 To establish their claim, petitioners-claimants examined Sohan Lal {First claimant} as PW1, who tendered affidavit Ex.PW1/A reiterating the averments of petition.

In cross-examination, he answered that prior to issuing disability certificate, patient was treated by him one time. The patient had applied for his disability on 11.03.2015 and Board has issued the same on 06.05.2015. The disability assessed by the Board is of particular limb only. The board had issued disability on the basis of guidelines of Haryana Govt. from time to time. PW4 Dr. Harsh Vardhan , Senior Resident, PGI Chandigarh, deposed that patients namely Sohan Lal and Sahab Singh were admitted in PGI Chandigarh vide CR No.2014 as a case of Road side SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 9 accident. Patient Sohan Lal was discharged on 8.12.2014 as per discharge card Ex.P2, whereas patient Sahab Singh was discharged on 10.11.2014 vide discharge card Ex.P4.

PW5, Ramesh Lal {Criminal Ahlmad in the court of Ms. Rajni Kaushal, JMIC Pehowa, District, Kurukshetra} has produced the summoned record pertaining to case titled as State Vs Janak Raj, FIR No.134 dated 31.10.2014, u/s 279, 337, 338 IPC PS Ismailabad and the case was adjourned to 02.12.2015 for prosecution evidence. He has proved the copy of challan as Ex.P5, copy of charge sheet as Ex.P6; certified copy of site plan as Ex.P7, Mechanical report of Vehicle No. HR-01-P-3991 as Ex.P8 and mechanical report of HR-37-A-7707 as Ex.P9. The vehicle No. HR-37-A-7707 was taken into possession by the police and same was released on superdari to its original owner vide order dated 3.11.2014. In cross-examination he answered that route SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 10 permit of truck No.HR37A-7707 was not on the file. He has proved the copy of RC of vehicle No. HR-37-A-7707 as Ex.R1 DL of Janak Raj as Ex.R2 and copy of fitness certificate of vehicle No.HR-37-A-7707 as Ex.R3. Thereafter, learned counsel for claimants tendered documents i.e medical bills of Sahib Singh as Ex.P10 to Ex.P32 and medical bills of Sohan Lal as Ex.P33 to Ex.P107 and closed the evidence of the claimants vide his separately recorded statement. On the other hand, respondent No.2 tendered copy of insurance policy as Ex.R4 and t heir evidence was closed on 14.01.2016. No rebuttal evidence was led and learned counsel for the claimants closed the rebuttal evidence vide recorded statement dated 14.01.2016. 8I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1 : 9 Under this issue, petitioners- claimants are required to prove the fact that motor vehicular accident was occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Respondent no.1, while driving truck bearing Number HR-37-A-7707, resulting into causing injuries to Sohan Lal and Sahab Singh and as such the claimants are entitled to appropriate compensation from respondents. 10Learned counsel for the petitioners-claimants has argued that since accident in question was taken place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1 resulting causing injuries to Sohan Lal and Sahab Singh and offending vehicle is insured with SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 11 respondent no.2, therefore, respondent No.1 and respondent No.2 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. Learned counsel for claimants has further contended that vehicle in question was very much involved in the alleged accident and insured with respondent no.2. He urged for allowing the instant petition. 11 On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent no.1 has argued that no such accident, as alleged, was ever taken place with the involvement of offending vehicle, rather, False FIR was lodged against the respondent No.1, therefore, no negligence could be attributed to the respondent No.1 and in this view of the matter, no liability could be fastened upon the respondent no.1. He further urged that vehicle was insured with respondent no.2 and so owner of vehicle did not breach any condition of policy, therefore, insurance company has to indemnify the insured and as such both petitions are liable to be dismissed qua respondent no. 1 being devoid of merits. 12 Learned counsel for respondent No.2 has argued that FIR was registered against respondent No.1 only after due manipulation in collusion with each other just to shift undue burden upon the insurance company. He further argued that no accident was taken place with the offending vehicle belonging to respondent No.1, rather, Sohan Lal and Sahab Singh sustained injuries due to the fault of Sahab Singh as he was riding accidental motorcycle carrying three occupants against statutory rules or without caring traffic rules and so if accident is admitted, even then, sahib Singh can not be spared from contributory liability . He further SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 12 argued that respondent no.1 has breached the covenent of policy by non production of route permit and so insurance company is not liable to pay compensation and prayed for dismissal both petitions. 13I have given due regard to the rival contentions put forth by learned counsel for respective parties and have evaluated the entire oral evidence coupled with documentary evidence carefully. After thorough examination, it is observed that the petitioners-claimants have come to this Tribunal with categorical stand that the accident was taken place due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing Number HR-37-A-7707, resulting into causing injuries to Sohan Lal and Sahab Singh . In order to prove factum of accident, PW1 & PW2 {injured/eye witnesses} categorically stated through affidavits with regard to factum of accident, which was occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of truck bearing Number HR-37-A-7707 by respondent No.1. Further PW1 and PW2 being injured tendered affidavit EX.PW1/A and EX.PW2/A supporting the factum of accident. They were cross examined at length, but nothing adverse can be extracted disbelieving the factual position of motor vehicular accident. In this way, statement of PW1, PW2 being injured, can not be doubted from any angle regarding involvement of offending vehicle in the motor vehicular accident, particularly, when their statement are corroborated with documentary evidence like registration of FIR, copy of challan as Ex.P5, copy of charge sheet as Ex.P6; certified copy of site plan as Ex.P7, Mechanical report of Vehicle No. HR-01-P- 3991 as Ex.P8 and mechanical report of HR-37-A-7707 as Ex.P9. It SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 13 would be appropriate to point out here that despite availing opportunities, respondents failed to rebut the testimonies of claimants with regard to involvement of offending vehicle falsely in the said accident. Mere denial of rash and negligence at the behest of respondents after causing accident resulting causing injuries to two occupants of motor cycle, are not found sufficient at all disbelieving the factual position of accident. 14It is quite well settled that the lodging of the first information report is not an essential prerequisite for claiming compensation arising from a motor accident. Each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The Tribunal is expected to adjudge a case on the basis of the evidence produced without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled position of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. It must be remembered that in a motor accident claim, the claimants are not required to prove their case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. It is trite law that claimants-petitioners are required to prove its case, which sets up the particular case relating to the accident which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts upon the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way as alleged by the claimants. The provisions with regard to claim under the Act are enacted keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimants are always entitled for compensation irrespective whether the police has registered SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 14 the offence regarding the incident or not because no claim case can be left over on the mercy of the police. The evidence brought on record irrefutably leads to the inference in terms of unrebutted evidence at the instance of petitioners that there was taken place accident between motor cycle and ambulance van resulting causing injuries to claimants and death of driver of offending vehicle. In this way, it can be held that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of driver of offending vehicle. If rider Sahab Singh was riding motor cycle with two pillion riders against the statutory provision/ traffic rules, then he is liable to face punishment under traffic rules as per law. Accordingly, this issue no.1 is decided in favour of the claimants. ISSUE NO. 2: 15The onus to prove this issue is upon claimants. Learned counsel for claimants has submitted that offending vehicle was owned by respondent no.1 and was insured with respondent no.2, therefore, insurance company is liable to indemnify the insured and prayed for allowing petition. In support to his contention, he has placed reliance upon following authorities; In Arvind Kumar Mishra Vs. New India Assurance Co. Ltd and another, 2010 (4) RCR (Civil) 917 , it has been observed that Motor Accident- How to assess of earnings in respect of a victim who suffered 70% disablement:-Motor Accident due to rash and negligent driving of a truck driver- Claimant suffered 70% permanent disablement (right hand amputated, loss of vision of right eye) Victim was aged 25 years and a SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 15 brilliant student of Engineering with bright carrier- His earnings assessed at Rs.60,000/- per annum payable to Assistant Engineer in public employment- Since he suffered 70% permanent disability the future earnings may be discounted by 30% which came to Rs.42,000/- per annum- The operative multiplier would be 18. The loss of future earnings by multiplying the multiplicand of Rs.42,000/- by a multiplier of 18 comes to Rs.7,56,000/-. A sum of Rs.1.50 lacs awarded toward medical expenses- The total amount of compensation to which the appellant is entitled is Rs.9,06,000. It has been further observed that Award of compensation- Perfect compensation is hardly possible- However, Court must take care to give the victim full and fair compensation for that he had suffered- In some cases for personal injury, the cases for personal injury, the claim could be in respect of life time's earnings lost because, though, he will live, he cannot earn his living- In others, the claim may be made for partial loss of earnings- Each case has to be considered in the light of its own facts and at the end, one must ask whether the sum awarded is a fair and reasonable sum. In Raj Kumar Vs. Ajay Kumar and another, 2011 (1) ACC 1, it has been observed that Quantum injury- Principles of assessment- Determination of loss of future earnings of the injured with reference to extent of his permanent disablement explained- Principles enumerated and illustrations given. Principles are: (i)All injuries for permanent disabilities arising from injuries, SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 16 do not result in loss of earning capacity. (ii)The percentage of permanent disability with reference to the whole body of a person, cannot be assumed to be the percentage of loss of earning capacity. To put it differently, the percentage of loss of earning capacity is not the same as the percentage of permanent disability (except in a few cases, where the Tribunal on the basis of evidence, concludes that percentage of loss of earning capacity is the same as percentage of permanent disability). (iii)The doctor who treated an injured-claimant or who examined him subsequently to assess the extent of his permanent disability can give evidence only in regard to the extent of permanent disability. The loss of earning capacity is something that will have to be assessed by the Tribunal with reference to the evidence in entirety. (iv)The same permanent disability may result in different percentages of loss of earning capacity in different persons, depending upon the nature of profession, occupation or job, age, education and other factors. It has also been observed that Quantum- Injury- Principles of assessment- Personal expenses- Whether one-third or any other percentage may be deducted as personal or living expenses from income of the injured while computing his future loss of earnings- Held: No. In K. Suresh Vs. New India Assurance Co.Ltd. And another, 2012 ACJ 2694 , it has been observed that Quantum- Injury- Principles of assessment- Loss of earning power and permanent disability- Injured sustained injuries resulting in 40 per cent permanent disablement- SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 17 Tribunal awarded Rs.5,00,000 for loss of earning capacity and further Rs.3,00,000 towards permanent disablement-Appellate court allowed Rs.4,68,000 for loss of earning capacity and disallowed compensation for permanent disablement- Whether total deletion of compensation for permanent disablement is justified- Held: no, compensation can be granted under both heads. In Karnail Singh and others Vs. Balwinder Singh and another, 2013 (1) PLR 774 , it has been observed that three persons on a motorcycle having been hit by Maruti car coming from behind- The three persons traveling on a motorcycle may have been guilty of traffic offence but there is no reason for the Court to make any inference regarding negligence as contributory by the only fact that three persons were going on motorcycle. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents No.2 has vehemently argued that although offending vehicle was insured with policy EX.R4 but no route permit has been brought on record. He further argued that injured Sahib Singh was riding motor cycle with two pillion riders as admitted and so he is contributory liable to share as he was also driving the motorcycle in violation of the provisions of Motor Vehicles Act and prayed for dismissal the same. Learned counsel for respondents no.2 has placed reliance upon following case law:- In support to his contentions, learned counsel for respondent No.2 has placed reliance upon case law cited as Angrejo Devi and others Vs. Jai Parkash and Others, 2012 (4) PLR 604, wherein it has been observed that Negligence- Motor cycle is designed to ride two persons, if used by more than two SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 18 persons, then the driver will have to share part of his seat, he will not be able to control the vehicle effectively- Moreover, the weight on account of third passenger will affect its stability- was also driving the motorcycle in violation of the provisions of the M.V Act- Learned Tribunal has rightly come to the conclusion that it was a case of contributory negligence of the deceased in the ratio of 50% each. In Madan Lal Papneja Vs. State of Haryana and others, 2011 (1) PLR 61 , it has been observed that Disability may either be permanent or temporary- For permanent disability- which is capable of ascertainment in terms of percentage of functional disability of the particular organ of the body that is affected, the amount could be Rs.1000/- for every % of permanent disability and Rs.250/- for every % of temporary disability. In Kamala Mangalal Vayani and others Vs. M/s United India Insurance Company Ltd and others, 2010 (2) PLR 687 , it has been observed that Owner and driver proceeded ex parte- Failure of insurance company to prove that the vehicle had no permit- Insurance company held liable- Insured can proceed against the owner and recovering the amount paid by it so the claimants, in the event of the insurer being able to establish, in any suit it may choose to file against the owner, that there was violation or breach of the conditions of the insurance policy or that the vehicle was not covered by a permit on the date of the accident. 16Having due regard to the rival contentions put forth by counsel for the parties, it is observed that rider of motorcycle namely SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 19 Sohan Lal was riding accidental vehicle by violating the statutory provision of law as admitted and therefore this substantial fact can be taken into consideration for breach of traffic rules as per law as held in Karnail Singh and others Vs. Balwinder Singh and another, 2013 (1) PLR 774,. According to evidence, it can be gathered that injured Sohan Lal remained admitted as indoor patient w.e.f.31.10.2104 to 8.12.2014 and he spent total amount of Rs.1,57,211 { In round figure 1,57,300/-} as per medical bills EX.P33-EX.P106. He did not sustain any permanent disability and as such following assessment is made; Pecuniary damages (Special damages) (i).Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization in PGI, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and miscellaneous expenditure.RS.1,57,300/- medical expenses and Rs. 9000/- as indoor patient @ 1000/- per day including all expenses. (ii).Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising: (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment; (b) Loss of future earning on account of injuries etc. 5000/- nil (iii).

However, it has already discussed in detail under Issue No.1 & 2 that accident was occurred due to SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 22 rash ad negligent driving of respondent no.1. In this way, it has become obvious on file that this tribunal has left with no other option except to decide these issues against Respondents. Accordingly, these issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.6: 22 Coming to question of liability where under onus to prove this issue is upon the respondent No.2, who is under the obligation to prove the fact that respondent No.1 was not holding valid driving licence to run offending vehicle at the day of alleged accident and as such he has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. 23However, there is nothing on record to show that respondent No.1, was not holding any valid license, rather same is proved as EX.R2 . Further Insurance Policy Ex.R4 reveals that offending vehicle as per RC EX.R1 in the name of respondent no.1 was insured with the respondent No.2 at the time of accident. The respondent no.1 has also furnished fitness certificate of offending vehicle as EX.R3 and so non production of route permit would not defeat right of respondent no.1 to indemnify the claim by respondent no.2. Resultantly, respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation as such respondent no.2 shall indemnify the claim. Accordingly, this Issue is decided against the respondent No.2. ISSUE NO.9 (RELIEF): BOTH Petitions succeed ; 24 In view of the foregoing discussion, both the claim petition are partly allowed with cost. Claimant-petitioner Sohan Lal is SOHAN LAL VS JANAK RAJ ETC 23 entitled to compensation of Rs. 1,86,300/- along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this claim petition till the date of actual payment.

In Second claim petition , claimant-petitioner Sahib Singh is entitled to compensation of Rs.3,24,300/- along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this claim petition till the date of actual payment. The awarded compensation amount along with the interest shall be payable jointly and severally by respondent no. 1 and 2 and respondent no.2 insurance company shall indemnify the insured. Remaining relief sought by both claimants stands declined. It is further made clear that 50 percent amount shall be deposited in FDR for three years in any Nationalized bank.

Shri Narender Batra, Counsel for the respondent No.1 & 2. Shri Mohinder Bindal, Counsel for the respondent No.3. AWARD:- This award shall dispose of aforesaid two claim petitions titled as Vijay Gulati etc Vs Ramesh Bhardwaj etc (hereinafter referred to as “First Petition”) and titled as Vijay Gulati Vs Ramesh Bhardwaj etc (hereinafter referred to as “Second Petition”). Both the claim petitions are relating to one accident. Claimants of first petition sought compensation of Rs. 10,00,000/- on account of death of their minor daughter Baby Mannat and claimant of second petition sought compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- on account of injuries suffered by her i n motor vehicular accident on 14.12.2014, which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596 by the VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 3 respondent No.1, who is driver of accidental vehicle and at the relevant time, the vehicle in question was owned with respondent No.2 and was insured with the respondent no.3. 2The relevant facts leading to claim petitions are that on 13.12.2014, Baby Mannat, {since deceased} in the company of her mother-claimant No1 and other relatives went to Chhachhrauli in Jagran at the house of their relative. On 14.12.2014 at about 1.00 PM, the deceased along with her mother and other family members were coming back to her house at Baldev Nagar in a Maruti car bearing registration No. HR-01-R-3440 'being driven by Naveen Gulati on his correct side and in a very normal speed and at about 1.30 PM, when they reached near bus stand Kurali Bilaspur- Sadhaura road, in the meantime, a truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596 came from Sadhaura side, being driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and in a very high speed and without caring the traffic rules, struck the truck with the car after coming on the wrong side, due to this impact Naveen Gulati died on the spot. Due to the said accident, the front portion of the car was totally damaged, besides this, the deceased and other occupant of the car got serious injuries/multiple injuries. The deceased suffered injuries and was taken to Civil Hospital Yamuna Nagar and thereafter to Gaba Hospital, where she expired. The respondent No.1 was driving the truck in a very high speed, rashly and negligently that caused the serious injuries to the deceased and other occupant of the car, unfortunately, the daughter of the claimant namely Mannat has expired and the claimant No.1 also suffered the VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 4 injuries and was taken to civil hospital Yamuna Nagar in a ambulance and during course of treatment the only daughter of claimant had expired due to the injuries suffered in the accident. The accident was witnessed by Amit Kumar son of Joginder Lal, who was following the car on his motorcycle and other persons gathered at the spot. The deceased was very brilliant in studies and due to untimely death of Mannat, all their life have come into dark. It is further pleaded that deceased was the only child of the claimants and was studying in the good school and was a very brilliant student and used to gave all the love and affection of the claimant and deceased was the only hope of the claimants. The claimants have also spent more than Rs.,25,000/- on treatment of deceased and incurred Rs.50,000/- on transportation of dead body, funeral and last rites of the deceased. No claim of any kind was given to the claimants. 3The second claim petition reveals the similar facts of accident as already elaborated and rests of facts are that soon after the accident, injured was taken to General Hospital, Yamuna Nagar, where s he remained admitted as Indoor patient for about 4 days. The treatment is still going on from Shasan Hospital, Ambala City as outdoor patient. The claimant suffered multiple and grievous injuries on her legs, head arms, face, disfigured and other injuries on all the body. During this period, she had spent more than Rs.1,00,000/- on her treatment and still more amount is to be spent on her future treatment etc as she has not properly cured. The claimant has spent a sum of Rs.30,000/- on special diet and VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 5 conveyance etc. Due to this accident, the claimant could not perform her routine work as she received injuries on her head, arms and legs. The claimant could not join her duties for two months due to the injuries suffered in the accident. The injured was 36 years of age at the time of accident. Prior to this accident, she was regularly doing her job and she had to suffer a lot and she could not do her duties and could not earn her income of Rs.25,000/- per month from the date of accident for two months. The injuries sustained by the claimant in the accident has decreased the span of her morality and she was not in a position to do her duties, which requires lot of energy, activeness and physical fitness and the same has caused her an irreparable loss and injuries. No claim of any kind was given to the claimants. The accident took place due to sole rash and negligence of driver of Offending truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596. On the basis of statement of Amit Kumar, FIR No. 294 dated 14.12.2014 under section 279, 337, 427, 304-A IPC was registered in Police Station, Bilaspur against the respondent No.1. Since, the vehicle in question was owned by respondent No.2 and was insured with respondent No.3 at the day of accident and as such all respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation, hence, the petitions. 4Notice of both petition were given to the respondents. Respondent no.1 and 3 have put in appearance and filed written statement controverting the assertions made in the petitions. They took some preliminary objections qua maintainability, concealment of true and VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 6 material facts; that no accident took place with the alleged truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596, however, a criminal case of accident was got registered against the answering respondent No.1 in connivance with the claimant and the police just to get compensation; that claim petitions are bad for mis-joinder and non-joinder of necessary parties; the driver owner and insurer of alleged Maruti Car bearing registration No. HR- 01R-3440 have not been impleaded in the claim petitions being necessary parties and in their absence, the claim petitions are liable to be dismissed. On merit, it is submitted alleged injured might have suffered injuries in the accident by some unknown vehicle, which number could not be noted down. The income of the claimant shown is much excessive to the knowledge of claimant herself. The claimant had not suffered any alleged injury or fractures by the vehicle allegedly involved in this accident. The truck of respondent No.2 has been falsely implicated out of greed just to get compensation from the answering respondents. More over the amount alleged to have been spent on the alleged treatment is much excessive to the knowledge of claimant herself. Since no accident took place with the truck in question, so, the claimants are not entitled to any compensation from the answering respondents. However, it is submitted that answering respondent No.1 has been falsely implicated in the claim petitions just to grab compensation on the basis of false FIR, which was got lodged in connivance with the police and prayed for dismissal the same with costs. 5The respondent No. 3 filed separate written statement controverting the assertions made in the petition and took some VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 7 preliminary objections that petition qua answering respondent is ex-facie, misconceived, vexatious, untenable and devoid of any merit; no accident has taken place with alleged truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z- 8596, however, the present claim petitions have been filed just to extract compensation from the answering respondent by falsely impleading the said vehicle and its driver in the present case on the basis of a concocted and manipulated version by creating and managing false evidence and by introducing a manipulated witness as well; that if the cause of action is proved, even then, the answering insurance company is not liable to indemnify the owner of the truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596 qua the alleged accident since the driver of the alleged truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596 was not having a valid and effective driving licence, permit/authorization and fitness at the time of alleged accident and thus was driving the same in violation of the terms and conditions of insurance policy; that if it is presumed though not admitted that any accident had taken place on the aforesaid date, even then the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation since the deceased suffered the alleged injuries and death due to sole rash and negligent driving of car No. HR-01R-3440 by its driver at fast and uncontrollable speed without caring rules and traffic on the road; that claim petitions are bad for mis joinder and non joinder of necessary parties; that answering respondent takes all the pleas available under sections 147, 149 (2), 157 & 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act. On merit, it is submitted on the similar lines as taken in the preliminary objections and VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 8 prayed for dismissal of claim petitions with costs. 6At the time of framing of issues, both the claim petitions were consolidated. Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following consolidated issues were framed vide order dated 05.11.2015:- 1.Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1 while driving Truck bearing Registration No.HR-38-Z-8596 resulting into causing death of Baby Mannat and injuries to claimant Vijay Gulati, as alleged? OPP. 2If Issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom, the claimants are entitled to ? OPP. 3Whether petitions are not maintainable in the present form ? OPR 4Whether the petitioners have not come to the court with clean hands and have suppressed true and material facts from the court ? OPR 5Whether petitions are bad for non joinder and mis joinder of necessary parties ? OPR 6Whether respondent No.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect ? OPR 7Whether respondent No.3 is entitled to take all the defences available to it under the M. V . Act ? OPR 8Relief. 7 To substantiate their claim, petitioners-claimants examined Smt Vijay Gulati as PW1, who tendered affidavit Ex.PW1/A reiterating the averments made in the petition. In cross-examination, she answered that she was sitting on the front seat of car by the side of driver. They were coming back after attending a Jagran in the night of 13/14.12.2014. The VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 9 offending truck came from opposite direction. Front portion of the car got damaged in the accident. The front driver side of the truck struck against their car. The accident took place at the mettled road. Her cousin namely Amit was coming behind on his motorcycle. The police had arrived at the spot in her presence. She was semi conscious on the arrival of the police. She was shifted to the hospital and the other proceedings were done by her cousin Amit at the spot before the police. It is wrong to suggest that accident took place on the middle of the road or that the accident in question occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of the car. It is incorrect that their car went on the wrong side of the road or that hit the truck which was coming at a normal speed and on its correct side of the road. It is incorrect that they lodged a false complaint against the truck driver taking advantage of the casualty in their car and in order to save their car driver from civil and criminal liability in connivance with police in order to get compensation from the insurance company of the truck. She had not taken any claim from any other source or authority with regard to the present claims. She took treatment from Mukand Lal General Hospital, Yamuna Nagar. She had not suffered any fracture on her person. It is incorrect that she spent nothing upon her treatment or that she was only kept under observation. Learned counsel for the claimants tendered the documents i.e Copy of FIR as Ex.P1; Copy of MLR of Mannat Ex.P2; copy of PMR of Mannat Ex.P3; Death certificate of Mannat Ex.P4; Copy of Aadhar card of Charanjit Singh Ex.P5; Copy of Aadhar Card of Vijay Gulati Ex.P6; Certificate of leave of Vijay Gulati as VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 10 Ex.P9, Copy of Medical report of Vijay as Ex.P10; copy of MLR of Vijay Gulati as ExP11 & Ex.P15; medical bills Ex.P12 and Ex.P13 , Copy of PAN card of Vijay Gulati as Ex.P14, copy of report under section 173 Cr.P.C as Ex.P16 and closed the evidence. On the other hand, Learned counsel for respondent No.3 tendered copy of site plan as Ex.R1 and copies of mechanical reports as Ex.R2 and Ex.R3 and the evidence of respondent No.3 was closed by court order. Further, learned counsel for Respondent no. 1 and 2 has tendered documents copy of RC as Ex.R4; National Permit Ex.R5, Ex.R6 and Ex.R7; Pollution certificate Ex.R8; fitness certificate Ex.R9, Driving licence Ex.R10, Passenger and goods taxation slip Ex.R11, Insurance policy as Ex.R12 and closed their evidence. No rebuttal evidence was led . 8I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1 : 9 Under this issue, petitioners- claimants are required to prove the fact that motor vehicular accident was occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Respondent no.1 while driving truck bearing registration number HR-38-Z-8596, resulting death of Baby Mannat aged 3/½ and causing injuries to second claimant Vijay Gulati and as such the claimants are entitled to appropriate compensation from respondents. 10 Learned counsel for the petitioners-claimants has argued that four persons were travelling in the accidental car and they all sustained injuries, but minor daughter Mannat and brother Naveen Gulati VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 11 were succumbed to their injuries and she and her mother sustained injuries, mother of Vijay Gulati has already instituted claim petition before MACT Jagadhri and petitioner Vijay Gulati is settled in District Ambala, therefore, she has instituted both claim petition. He further argued that factum of accident is well proved. Further, Smt.Vijay Gulati remained hospitalized w.e.f. 14.12.2014 to 18.12.2014 in Civil Hospital and private hospital. She spent amount on her medical treatment. The age of Smt. Vijay Gulati is 36 years and so multiplier of 15 by considering notional income of minor deceased be applied and prayed for allowing these claim petitions. In support to his contentions, he has placed reliance upon Smt. Sushma and Anr. Vs. State of Haryana and Ors., 2014 (2) RCR (Civil) 452 (P&H) , wherein it has been observed that Fatal accident- Death of child- Compensation-Deceased aged 3 years, daughter of appellant, died in road accident- Ld. Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs.50,000/-, as compensation- Income of child taken as 30000/- per annum and applying the multiplier of 15, according to the age of the parents of the deceased, awarded a sum of Rs.4,50,000/- plus Rs.50,000/- under conventional heads- Compensation enhanced. 11On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents No.1 and 2 has vehemently argued that no accident took place with the offending vehicle and false and frivolous FIR has been lodged. However, respondent No.2 was holding valid documents Ex.R4 to Ex.R9 while plying the vehicle at the relevant date. Further, respondent No.1 was holding valid driving licence Ex.R10 and so if any, compensation is VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 12 awarded, then respondent No.3 insurance company is liable to indemnify the claimants as per insurance policy Ex.R10 and prayed for dismissal these claim petitions qua them. 12On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent No.3 has vehemently argued that petitioner Vijay Gulati is working as Lecturer and is earning handsome salary and so she cannot be treated as dependent upon the income of minor deceased and so authority relied upon by counsel for claimants is not applicable to these petitions. He further argued that if any minor is died in road accident, then it is appropriate to award lump sum amount like 'No fault liability' to the extent of Rs.50,000/- maximum on account of death of minor and prayed for dismissal the instant claim petitions. 13 I have given due regard to the rival contentions put forth by learned counsel for respective parties and have evaluated the entire oral evidence coupled with documentary evidence carefully. After thorough examination, it is observed that the petitioners-claimants have come to this Tribunal with categorical stand that the accident was taken place due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle no. HR-38-Z-8596 by Respondent No.1, resulting into death of Baby Mannat and causing injuries to Smt. Vijay Gulati. In order to prove factum of accident, PW1 Vijay Gulati {injured/eye witness} categorically stated through affidavit Ex.PW1/A with regard to factum of accident, which was occurred due to sole rash and negligent act of the respondent No.1 while driving truck bearing registration No. HR-38-Z-8596 on public road, so as to endanger human VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 13 life and safety. She was cross examined, but nothing can be extracted disbelieving factum of non involvement of offending vehicle in the motor vehicular accident, rather, no suggestion was even put forth with regard to manipulation while lodging FIR against respondent No.1. In this way, statement of eye witness/injured PW1 can not be doubted from any angle relating to the motor vehicular accident, particularly when her statement is corroborated with documentary evidence like Copy of FIR as Ex.P1; Copy of MLR of Mannat Ex.P2; copy of PMR of Mannat Ex.P3; death certificate of Mannat Ex.P4 and final report prepared u/s 173 CRPC as EX/P16. It may not be out of place to mention here that despite availing opportunities, respondents did not examine driver of offending vehicle to rebut the versions of PW1 reasons best known to them. Mere denial of rash and negligence at the behest of respondents after causing accident resulting death of a minor baby and causing injuries to Smt Vijay Gulati, are not found sufficient at all, rather, if there was no rash and negligent act at behest of driver, then driver could easily appear in the witness box to rebut the stand taken by claimants-petitioners. However, no reason has been assigned for non-examination of the driver of vehicle by Respondent no.1 and 2. In accident cases, it may collect the first hand report from the driver. It may also be said that the driver does not always speak the truth, but the driver's version is the one which is to be given the best consideration. He also knows that as to what actually happened and if the driver has not been examined, then an adverse inference must be drawn against him. To that effect, reliance can be placed on ruling Raju and VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 14 others versus Sukhvinder Singh and others, 2006(4)RCR(civil) 82 (P&H). 14It is quite well settled that the lodging of the first information report is not an essential prerequisite for claiming compensation arising from a motor accident. Each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The Tribunal is expected to adjudge a case on the basis of the evidence produced without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled position of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. It must be remembered that in a motor accident claim, the claimants are not required to prove their case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. It is trite law that claimants-petitioners are required to prove its case, which sets up the particular case relating to the accident which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts upon the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way as alleged by the claimants. The provisions with regard to claim under the Act are enacted keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimants are always entitled for compensation irrespective whether the police has registered the offence regarding the incident or not because no claim case can be left over on the mercy of the police. 15 The evidence brought on record irrefutably leads to the inference in terms of unrebutted evidence at the instance of petitioners VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 15 that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1, resulting in death of baby mannat and injuries attributed to Smt Vijay Gulati. Since the respondent No.1 has been facing trial as per final report EX.P16 under section 279, 337, 304 A and 427 of IPC before Jagadhari Court, therefore, in view of the law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993 (2) P .L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008 (2) R.C.R. (Civil) 774 , it can be safely held that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1. Accordingly, this issue no.1 is decided in favour of the claimants. ISSUE NO. 2: 16 Onus to prove this issue is upon claimants. PW1 has categorically stated that her daughter was died on account of injuries suffered by her in a motor vehicular accident. The age of deceased Mannat was 3½ years at the day of accident on 14.12.2014. In view of case law titled as Smt. Sushma and Anr. Vs. State of Haryana and Ors., 2014 (2) RCR (Civil) 452 (P&H) supra and multiplier of 15 according to age of parents are applied by taking into consideration the notional income of Rs.30000/- annually after due deduction of 50 percent amount on her personal livings, expenses etc, the exact assessment of compensation would come to {30000x15= 4,50,000 minus fifty percent} Rs.2,25,000/-. Additionally, petitioners being parents have deprived from love and affection and also suffered pain, agony due to untimely death of their minor daughter, therefore, they are entitled to Rs.50,000/- in that VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 16 head. They have also spent amount on last rites/funeral of deceased and so they are entitled to funeral expenses amounting Rs.20,000/-. In this manner, a total compensation is computed to Rs.2,95,000/- which shall be payable along with interest @ 7.5/- per annum from the date of filing the petition till its realization to the petitioners. Rests of relief sought by petitioners-claimants stands declined. In this way first claimants are entitled to Rs.2,95,000/- along with interest @ 7.5/- per annum from the date of filing the petition till its realization in equal share. Accordingly, issue no.2 is decided in favour of claimants-petitioners. 17 So far as second claim petition is concerned; it is evident that claimant Smt Vijay Gulati received injuries in the accident . She did not sustain any permanent disability. In the instant case, claimant has produced medicine bills EX.P12 to EXP13 showing expenses of Rs 2661/- {in round figure 3000/-}. She remained hospitalized for one day as per patient information slip EX.P15 in M.L.G.H and Trauma Centre, Yamunagar. Although She availed leave from 15 December 2014 to 31 January 2015 as per letter EX.P9 issued by employer, but it would not show that she remained on medical leave for that period. According to version of petitioner coupled with medical evidence and i n view of the law settled in Raj Kumar Vs Ajay Kumar, (2011)1 SCC 343 , the petitioner is held entitled to the following compensation: Pecuniary damages (Special damages) (i).Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization in PGI, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and RS.3000/-medical expenses plus 1000/- as indoor patient including VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 17 miscellaneous expenditure. other expenses. (ii).Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising: (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment; (b) Loss of future earning on account of injuries etc. nil nil (iii). Future medical expenses. 5000/- None-pecuniary damages (General damages) (iv). Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries. RS. 5 ,000/- (v). Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage). nil (vi).Loss of expectation of life ( shortening of normal longevity). Nil. Total Compensation Rs.,14,000/- 18 In this way, second-claimant is held entitled to comenstaion of Rs.9,000/- along with interest @ 7.5% per annumfrom the date of filing of petition till realization of awarded amount, which is quite fair, just and reasonable. Rests of relief sought by petitioner-claimant stands declined. Accordingly, In view of above discussions, Issue no.2 is decided in the above stated terms, in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.3 to 5 & 7: 19 The onus to prove these issues are upon Respondents but they neither pressed these issues nor led any evidence. However, it has already discussed in detail under Issue No.1 & 2 that accident was occurred due to rash ad negligent driving of respondent no.1. In this way, it has become obvious on file that this tribunal has left with no other VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 18 option except to decide these issues against Respondents. Accordingly, these issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.6: 20 Coming to question of liability, where under, onus to prove is upon the respondent No.2, who is under the obligation to prove this fact that the respondent No.1 was not holding valid or genuine driving licence to drive offending vehicle at the day of alleged accident and as such driver cum insurer has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. However, there is nothing on record as per evidence that respondent No.1 was not holding any valid license rather same is proved as Ex.R10. Further offending vehicle as per RC as Ex.R4 supported with documents National Permit Ex.R5, Ex.R6 and Ex.R7; Pollution certificate Ex.R8; fitness certificate Ex.R9, Passenger and goods taxation slip Ex.R11,was fit to ply on public road. Not only this, Insurance Policy Ex.R12 reveals that accidental vehicle as per RC EX.R4 was insured with the respondent No.3 at the day of the alleged accident. There is nothing brought to notice of this tribunal that the Driving licence Ex.R10 was not valid on the date of the occurrence. Therefore, in the said circumstances, it is quite clear that the respondent No.2 did not violate or breach the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. Accordingly, this Issue is decided against the respondent No.3. ISSUE NO.8 (RELIEF): petitions succeed ; 21 In view of the foregoing discussion, all both petition are allowed with cost. In first claim petition, claimants-petitioners of first petition are VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 19 entitled to compensation of Rs.2,95,000/- along with interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this claim petition till the date of actual payment in equal share and their amount be deposited in FDR in any nationalized bank for two years and thereafter same be disbursed to them.

Shri Narender Batra, Counsel for the respondent No.1 & 2. Shri Mohinder Bindal, Counsel for the respondent No.3. AWARD:- This award shall dispose of aforesaid two claim petitions titled as Vijay Gulati etc Vs Ramesh Bhardwaj etc (hereinafter referred to as “First Petition”) and titled as Vijay Gulati Vs Ramesh Bhardwaj etc (hereinafter referred to as “Second Petition”). Both the claim petitions are relating to one accident. Claimants of first petition sought compensation of Rs. 10,00,000/- on account of death of their minor daughter Baby Mannat and claimant of second petition sought compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- on account of injuries suffered by her i n motor vehicular accident on 14.12.2014, which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596 by the VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 3 respondent No.1, who is driver of accidental vehicle and at the relevant time, the vehicle in question was owned with respondent No.2 and was insured with the respondent no.3. 2The relevant facts leading to claim petitions are that on 13.12.2014, Baby Mannat, {since deceased} in the company of her mother-claimant No1 and other relatives went to Chhachhrauli in Jagran at the house of their relative. On 14.12.2014 at about 1.00 PM, the deceased along with her mother and other family members were coming back to her house at Baldev Nagar in a Maruti car bearing registration No. HR-01-R-3440 'being driven by Naveen Gulati on his correct side and in a very normal speed and at about 1.30 PM, when they reached near bus stand Kurali Bilaspur- Sadhaura road, in the meantime, a truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596 came from Sadhaura side, being driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and in a very high speed and without caring the traffic rules, struck the truck with the car after coming on the wrong side, due to this impact Naveen Gulati died on the spot. Due to the said accident, the front portion of the car was totally damaged, besides this, the deceased and other occupant of the car got serious injuries/multiple injuries. The deceased suffered injuries and was taken to Civil Hospital Yamuna Nagar and thereafter to Gaba Hospital, where she expired. The respondent No.1 was driving the truck in a very high speed, rashly and negligently that caused the serious injuries to the deceased and other occupant of the car, unfortunately, the daughter of the claimant namely Mannat has expired and the claimant No.1 also suffered the VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 4 injuries and was taken to civil hospital Yamuna Nagar in a ambulance and during course of treatment the only daughter of claimant had expired due to the injuries suffered in the accident. The accident was witnessed by Amit Kumar son of Joginder Lal, who was following the car on his motorcycle and other persons gathered at the spot. The deceased was very brilliant in studies and due to untimely death of Mannat, all their life have come into dark. It is further pleaded that deceased was the only child of the claimants and was studying in the good school and was a very brilliant student and used to gave all the love and affection of the claimant and deceased was the only hope of the claimants. The claimants have also spent more than Rs.,25,000/- on treatment of deceased and incurred Rs.50,000/- on transportation of dead body, funeral and last rites of the deceased. No claim of any kind was given to the claimants. 3The second claim petition reveals the similar facts of accident as already elaborated and rests of facts are that soon after the accident, injured was taken to General Hospital, Yamuna Nagar, where s he remained admitted as Indoor patient for about 4 days. The treatment is still going on from Shasan Hospital, Ambala City as outdoor patient. The claimant suffered multiple and grievous injuries on her legs, head arms, face, disfigured and other injuries on all the body. During this period, she had spent more than Rs.1,00,000/- on her treatment and still more amount is to be spent on her future treatment etc as she has not properly cured. The claimant has spent a sum of Rs.30,000/- on special diet and VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 5 conveyance etc. Due to this accident, the claimant could not perform her routine work as she received injuries on her head, arms and legs. The claimant could not join her duties for two months due to the injuries suffered in the accident. The injured was 36 years of age at the time of accident. Prior to this accident, she was regularly doing her job and she had to suffer a lot and she could not do her duties and could not earn her income of Rs.25,000/- per month from the date of accident for two months. The injuries sustained by the claimant in the accident has decreased the span of her morality and she was not in a position to do her duties, which requires lot of energy, activeness and physical fitness and the same has caused her an irreparable loss and injuries. No claim of any kind was given to the claimants. The accident took place due to sole rash and negligence of driver of Offending truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596. On the basis of statement of Amit Kumar, FIR No. 294 dated 14.12.2014 under section 279, 337, 427, 304-A IPC was registered in Police Station, Bilaspur against the respondent No.1. Since, the vehicle in question was owned by respondent No.2 and was insured with respondent No.3 at the day of accident and as such all respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation, hence, the petitions. 4Notice of both petition were given to the respondents. Respondent no.1 and 3 have put in appearance and filed written statement controverting the assertions made in the petitions. They took some preliminary objections qua maintainability, concealment of true and VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 6 material facts; that no accident took place with the alleged truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596, however, a criminal case of accident was got registered against the answering respondent No.1 in connivance with the claimant and the police just to get compensation; that claim petitions are bad for mis-joinder and non-joinder of necessary parties; the driver owner and insurer of alleged Maruti Car bearing registration No. HR- 01R-3440 have not been impleaded in the claim petitions being necessary parties and in their absence, the claim petitions are liable to be dismissed. On merit, it is submitted alleged injured might have suffered injuries in the accident by some unknown vehicle, which number could not be noted down. The income of the claimant shown is much excessive to the knowledge of claimant herself. The claimant had not suffered any alleged injury or fractures by the vehicle allegedly involved in this accident. The truck of respondent No.2 has been falsely implicated out of greed just to get compensation from the answering respondents. More over the amount alleged to have been spent on the alleged treatment is much excessive to the knowledge of claimant herself. Since no accident took place with the truck in question, so, the claimants are not entitled to any compensation from the answering respondents. However, it is submitted that answering respondent No.1 has been falsely implicated in the claim petitions just to grab compensation on the basis of false FIR, which was got lodged in connivance with the police and prayed for dismissal the same with costs. 5The respondent No. 3 filed separate written statement controverting the assertions made in the petition and took some VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 7 preliminary objections that petition qua answering respondent is ex-facie, misconceived, vexatious, untenable and devoid of any merit; no accident has taken place with alleged truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z- 8596, however, the present claim petitions have been filed just to extract compensation from the answering respondent by falsely impleading the said vehicle and its driver in the present case on the basis of a concocted and manipulated version by creating and managing false evidence and by introducing a manipulated witness as well; that if the cause of action is proved, even then, the answering insurance company is not liable to indemnify the owner of the truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596 qua the alleged accident since the driver of the alleged truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596 was not having a valid and effective driving licence, permit/authorization and fitness at the time of alleged accident and thus was driving the same in violation of the terms and conditions of insurance policy; that if it is presumed though not admitted that any accident had taken place on the aforesaid date, even then the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation since the deceased suffered the alleged injuries and death due to sole rash and negligent driving of car No. HR-01R-3440 by its driver at fast and uncontrollable speed without caring rules and traffic on the road; that claim petitions are bad for mis joinder and non joinder of necessary parties; that answering respondent takes all the pleas available under sections 147, 149 (2), 157 & 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act. On merit, it is submitted on the similar lines as taken in the preliminary objections and VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 8 prayed for dismissal of claim petitions with costs. 6At the time of framing of issues, both the claim petitions were consolidated. Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following consolidated issues were framed vide order dated 05.11.2015:- 1.Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1 while driving Truck bearing Registration No.HR-38-Z-8596 resulting into causing death of Baby Mannat and injuries to claimant Vijay Gulati, as alleged? OPP. 2If Issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom, the claimants are entitled to ? OPP. 3Whether petitions are not maintainable in the present form ? OPR 4Whether the petitioners have not come to the court with clean hands and have suppressed true and material facts from the court ? OPR 5Whether petitions are bad for non joinder and mis joinder of necessary parties ? OPR 6Whether respondent No.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect ? OPR 7Whether respondent No.3 is entitled to take all the defences available to it under the M. V . Act ? OPR 8Relief. 7 To substantiate their claim, petitioners-claimants examined Smt Vijay Gulati as PW1, who tendered affidavit Ex.PW1/A reiterating the averments made in the petition. In cross-examination, she answered that she was sitting on the front seat of car by the side of driver. They were coming back after attending a Jagran in the night of 13/14.12.2014. The VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 9 offending truck came from opposite direction. Front portion of the car got damaged in the accident. The front driver side of the truck struck against their car. The accident took place at the mettled road. Her cousin namely Amit was coming behind on his motorcycle. The police had arrived at the spot in her presence. She was semi conscious on the arrival of the police. She was shifted to the hospital and the other proceedings were done by her cousin Amit at the spot before the police. It is wrong to suggest that accident took place on the middle of the road or that the accident in question occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of the car. It is incorrect that their car went on the wrong side of the road or that hit the truck which was coming at a normal speed and on its correct side of the road. It is incorrect that they lodged a false complaint against the truck driver taking advantage of the casualty in their car and in order to save their car driver from civil and criminal liability in connivance with police in order to get compensation from the insurance company of the truck. She had not taken any claim from any other source or authority with regard to the present claims. She took treatment from Mukand Lal General Hospital, Yamuna Nagar. She had not suffered any fracture on her person. It is incorrect that she spent nothing upon her treatment or that she was only kept under observation. Learned counsel for the claimants tendered the documents i.e Copy of FIR as Ex.P1; Copy of MLR of Mannat Ex.P2; copy of PMR of Mannat Ex.P3; Death certificate of Mannat Ex.P4; Copy of Aadhar card of Charanjit Singh Ex.P5; Copy of Aadhar Card of Vijay Gulati Ex.P6; Certificate of leave of Vijay Gulati as VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 10 Ex.P9, Copy of Medical report of Vijay as Ex.P10; copy of MLR of Vijay Gulati as ExP11 & Ex.P15; medical bills Ex.P12 and Ex.P13 , Copy of PAN card of Vijay Gulati as Ex.P14, copy of report under section 173 Cr.P.C as Ex.P16 and closed the evidence. On the other hand, Learned counsel for respondent No.3 tendered copy of site plan as Ex.R1 and copies of mechanical reports as Ex.R2 and Ex.R3 and the evidence of respondent No.3 was closed by court order. Further, learned counsel for Respondent no. 1 and 2 has tendered documents copy of RC as Ex.R4; National Permit Ex.R5, Ex.R6 and Ex.R7; Pollution certificate Ex.R8; fitness certificate Ex.R9, Driving licence Ex.R10, Passenger and goods taxation slip Ex.R11, Insurance policy as Ex.R12 and closed their evidence. No rebuttal evidence was led . 8I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1 : 9 Under this issue, petitioners- claimants are required to prove the fact that motor vehicular accident was occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Respondent no.1 while driving truck bearing registration number HR-38-Z-8596, resulting death of Baby Mannat aged 3/½ and causing injuries to second claimant Vijay Gulati and as such the claimants are entitled to appropriate compensation from respondents. 10 Learned counsel for the petitioners-claimants has argued that four persons were travelling in the accidental car and they all sustained injuries, but minor daughter Mannat and brother Naveen Gulati VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 11 were succumbed to their injuries and she and her mother sustained injuries, mother of Vijay Gulati has already instituted claim petition before MACT Jagadhri and petitioner Vijay Gulati is settled in District Ambala, therefore, she has instituted both claim petition. He further argued that factum of accident is well proved. Further, Smt.Vijay Gulati remained hospitalized w.e.f. 14.12.2014 to 18.12.2014 in Civil Hospital and private hospital. She spent amount on her medical treatment. The age of Smt. Vijay Gulati is 36 years and so multiplier of 15 by considering notional income of minor deceased be applied and prayed for allowing these claim petitions. In support to his contentions, he has placed reliance upon Smt. Sushma and Anr. Vs. State of Haryana and Ors., 2014 (2) RCR (Civil) 452 (P&H) , wherein it has been observed that Fatal accident- Death of child- Compensation-Deceased aged 3 years, daughter of appellant, died in road accident- Ld. Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs.50,000/-, as compensation- Income of child taken as 30000/- per annum and applying the multiplier of 15, according to the age of the parents of the deceased, awarded a sum of Rs.4,50,000/- plus Rs.50,000/- under conventional heads- Compensation enhanced. 11On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents No.1 and 2 has vehemently argued that no accident took place with the offending vehicle and false and frivolous FIR has been lodged. However, respondent No.2 was holding valid documents Ex.R4 to Ex.R9 while plying the vehicle at the relevant date. Further, respondent No.1 was holding valid driving licence Ex.R10 and so if any, compensation is VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 12 awarded, then respondent No.3 insurance company is liable to indemnify the claimants as per insurance policy Ex.R10 and prayed for dismissal these claim petitions qua them. 12On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent No.3 has vehemently argued that petitioner Vijay Gulati is working as Lecturer and is earning handsome salary and so she cannot be treated as dependent upon the income of minor deceased and so authority relied upon by counsel for claimants is not applicable to these petitions. He further argued that if any minor is died in road accident, then it is appropriate to award lump sum amount like 'No fault liability' to the extent of Rs.50,000/- maximum on account of death of minor and prayed for dismissal the instant claim petitions. 13 I have given due regard to the rival contentions put forth by learned counsel for respective parties and have evaluated the entire oral evidence coupled with documentary evidence carefully. After thorough examination, it is observed that the petitioners-claimants have come to this Tribunal with categorical stand that the accident was taken place due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle no. HR-38-Z-8596 by Respondent No.1, resulting into death of Baby Mannat and causing injuries to Smt. Vijay Gulati. In order to prove factum of accident, PW1 Vijay Gulati {injured/eye witness} categorically stated through affidavit Ex.PW1/A with regard to factum of accident, which was occurred due to sole rash and negligent act of the respondent No.1 while driving truck bearing registration No. HR-38-Z-8596 on public road, so as to endanger human VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 13 life and safety. She was cross examined, but nothing can be extracted disbelieving factum of non involvement of offending vehicle in the motor vehicular accident, rather, no suggestion was even put forth with regard to manipulation while lodging FIR against respondent No.1. In this way, statement of eye witness/injured PW1 can not be doubted from any angle relating to the motor vehicular accident, particularly when her statement is corroborated with documentary evidence like Copy of FIR as Ex.P1; Copy of MLR of Mannat Ex.P2; copy of PMR of Mannat Ex.P3; death certificate of Mannat Ex.P4 and final report prepared u/s 173 CRPC as EX/P16. It may not be out of place to mention here that despite availing opportunities, respondents did not examine driver of offending vehicle to rebut the versions of PW1 reasons best known to them. Mere denial of rash and negligence at the behest of respondents after causing accident resulting death of a minor baby and causing injuries to Smt Vijay Gulati, are not found sufficient at all, rather, if there was no rash and negligent act at behest of driver, then driver could easily appear in the witness box to rebut the stand taken by claimants-petitioners. However, no reason has been assigned for non-examination of the driver of vehicle by Respondent no.1 and 2. In accident cases, it may collect the first hand report from the driver. It may also be said that the driver does not always speak the truth, but the driver's version is the one which is to be given the best consideration. He also knows that as to what actually happened and if the driver has not been examined, then an adverse inference must be drawn against him. To that effect, reliance can be placed on ruling Raju and VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 14 others versus Sukhvinder Singh and others, 2006(4)RCR(civil) 82 (P&H). 14It is quite well settled that the lodging of the first information report is not an essential prerequisite for claiming compensation arising from a motor accident. Each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The Tribunal is expected to adjudge a case on the basis of the evidence produced without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled position of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. It must be remembered that in a motor accident claim, the claimants are not required to prove their case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. It is trite law that claimants-petitioners are required to prove its case, which sets up the particular case relating to the accident which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts upon the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way as alleged by the claimants. The provisions with regard to claim under the Act are enacted keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimants are always entitled for compensation irrespective whether the police has registered the offence regarding the incident or not because no claim case can be left over on the mercy of the police. 15 The evidence brought on record irrefutably leads to the inference in terms of unrebutted evidence at the instance of petitioners VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 15 that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1, resulting in death of baby mannat and injuries attributed to Smt Vijay Gulati. Since the respondent No.1 has been facing trial as per final report EX.P16 under section 279, 337, 304 A and 427 of IPC before Jagadhari Court, therefore, in view of the law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993 (2) P .L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008 (2) R.C.R. (Civil) 774 , it can be safely held that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1. Accordingly, this issue no.1 is decided in favour of the claimants. ISSUE NO. 2: 16 Onus to prove this issue is upon claimants. PW1 has categorically stated that her daughter was died on account of injuries suffered by her in a motor vehicular accident. The age of deceased Mannat was 3½ years at the day of accident on 14.12.2014. In view of case law titled as Smt. Sushma and Anr. Vs. State of Haryana and Ors., 2014 (2) RCR (Civil) 452 (P&H) supra and multiplier of 15 according to age of parents are applied by taking into consideration the notional income of Rs.30000/- annually after due deduction of 50 percent amount on her personal livings, expenses etc, the exact assessment of compensation would come to {30000x15= 4,50,000 minus fifty percent} Rs.2,25,000/-. Additionally, petitioners being parents have deprived from love and affection and also suffered pain, agony due to untimely death of their minor daughter, therefore, they are entitled to Rs.50,000/- in that VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 16 head. They have also spent amount on last rites/funeral of deceased and so they are entitled to funeral expenses amounting Rs.20,000/-. In this manner, a total compensation is computed to Rs.2,95,000/- which shall be payable along with interest @ 7.5/- per annum from the date of filing the petition till its realization to the petitioners. Rests of relief sought by petitioners-claimants stands declined. In this way first claimants are entitled to Rs.2,95,000/- along with interest @ 7.5/- per annum from the date of filing the petition till its realization in equal share. Accordingly, issue no.2 is decided in favour of claimants-petitioners. 17 So far as second claim petition is concerned; it is evident that claimant Smt Vijay Gulati received injuries in the accident . She did not sustain any permanent disability. In the instant case, claimant has produced medicine bills EX.P12 to EXP13 showing expenses of Rs 2661/- {in round figure 3000/-}. She remained hospitalized for one day as per patient information slip EX.P15 in M.L.G.H and Trauma Centre, Yamunagar. Although She availed leave from 15 December 2014 to 31 January 2015 as per letter EX.P9 issued by employer, but it would not show that she remained on medical leave for that period. According to version of petitioner coupled with medical evidence and i n view of the law settled in Raj Kumar Vs Ajay Kumar, (2011)1 SCC 343 , the petitioner is held entitled to the following compensation: Pecuniary damages (Special damages) (i).Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization in PGI, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and RS.3000/-medical expenses plus 1000/- as indoor patient including VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 17 miscellaneous expenditure. other expenses. (ii).Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising: (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment; (b) Loss of future earning on account of injuries etc. nil nil (iii). Future medical expenses. 5000/- None-pecuniary damages (General damages) (iv). Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries. RS. 5 ,000/- (v). Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage). nil (vi).Loss of expectation of life ( shortening of normal longevity). Nil. Total Compensation Rs.,14,000/- 18 In this way, second-claimant is held entitled to comenstaion of Rs.9,000/- along with interest @ 7.5% per annumfrom the date of filing of petition till realization of awarded amount, which is quite fair, just and reasonable. Rests of relief sought by petitioner-claimant stands declined. Accordingly, In view of above discussions, Issue no.2 is decided in the above stated terms, in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.3 to 5 & 7: 19 The onus to prove these issues are upon Respondents but they neither pressed these issues nor led any evidence. However, it has already discussed in detail under Issue No.1 & 2 that accident was occurred due to rash ad negligent driving of respondent no.1. In this way, it has become obvious on file that this tribunal has left with no other VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 18 option except to decide these issues against Respondents. Accordingly, these issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.6: 20 Coming to question of liability, where under, onus to prove is upon the respondent No.2, who is under the obligation to prove this fact that the respondent No.1 was not holding valid or genuine driving licence to drive offending vehicle at the day of alleged accident and as such driver cum insurer has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. However, there is nothing on record as per evidence that respondent No.1 was not holding any valid license rather same is proved as Ex.R10. Further offending vehicle as per RC as Ex.R4 supported with documents National Permit Ex.R5, Ex.R6 and Ex.R7; Pollution certificate Ex.R8; fitness certificate Ex.R9, Passenger and goods taxation slip Ex.R11,was fit to ply on public road. Not only this, Insurance Policy Ex.R12 reveals that accidental vehicle as per RC EX.R4 was insured with the respondent No.3 at the day of the alleged accident. There is nothing brought to notice of this tribunal that the Driving licence Ex.R10 was not valid on the date of the occurrence. Therefore, in the said circumstances, it is quite clear that the respondent No.2 did not violate or breach the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. Accordingly, this Issue is decided against the respondent No.3. ISSUE NO.8 (RELIEF): petitions succeed ; 21 In view of the foregoing discussion, all both petition are allowed with cost. In first claim petition, claimants-petitioners of first petition are VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 19 entitled to compensation of Rs.2,95,000/- along with interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this claim petition till the date of actual payment in equal share and their amount be deposited in FDR in any nationalized bank for two years and thereafter same be disbursed to them. In S econd claim petition , claimant -petitioner is entitled to compensation of Rs.14,000/- along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this claim petition till the date of actual payment.

Shri Narender Batra, Counsel for the respondent No.1 & 2. Shri Mohinder Bindal, Counsel for the respondent No.3. AWARD:- This award shall dispose of aforesaid two claim petitions titled as Vijay Gulati etc Vs Ramesh Bhardwaj etc (hereinafter referred to as “First Petition”) and titled as Vijay Gulati Vs Ramesh Bhardwaj etc (hereinafter referred to as “Second Petition”). Both the claim petitions are relating to one accident. Claimants of first petition sought compensation of Rs. 10,00,000/- on account of death of their minor daughter Baby Mannat and claimant of second petition sought compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- on account of injuries suffered by her i n motor vehicular accident on 14.12.2014, which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596 by the VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 3 respondent No.1, who is driver of accidental vehicle and at the relevant time, the vehicle in question was owned with respondent No.2 and was insured with the respondent no.3. 2The relevant facts leading to claim petitions are that on 13.12.2014, Baby Mannat, {since deceased} in the company of her mother-claimant No1 and other relatives went to Chhachhrauli in Jagran at the house of their relative. On 14.12.2014 at about 1.00 PM, the deceased along with her mother and other family members were coming back to her house at Baldev Nagar in a Maruti car bearing registration No. HR-01-R-3440 'being driven by Naveen Gulati on his correct side and in a very normal speed and at about 1.30 PM, when they reached near bus stand Kurali Bilaspur- Sadhaura road, in the meantime, a truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596 came from Sadhaura side, being driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and in a very high speed and without caring the traffic rules, struck the truck with the car after coming on the wrong side, due to this impact Naveen Gulati died on the spot. Due to the said accident, the front portion of the car was totally damaged, besides this, the deceased and other occupant of the car got serious injuries/multiple injuries. The deceased suffered injuries and was taken to Civil Hospital Yamuna Nagar and thereafter to Gaba Hospital, where she expired. The respondent No.1 was driving the truck in a very high speed, rashly and negligently that caused the serious injuries to the deceased and other occupant of the car, unfortunately, the daughter of the claimant namely Mannat has expired and the claimant No.1 also suffered the VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 4 injuries and was taken to civil hospital Yamuna Nagar in a ambulance and during course of treatment the only daughter of claimant had expired due to the injuries suffered in the accident. The accident was witnessed by Amit Kumar son of Joginder Lal, who was following the car on his motorcycle and other persons gathered at the spot. The deceased was very brilliant in studies and due to untimely death of Mannat, all their life have come into dark. It is further pleaded that deceased was the only child of the claimants and was studying in the good school and was a very brilliant student and used to gave all the love and affection of the claimant and deceased was the only hope of the claimants. The claimants have also spent more than Rs.,25,000/- on treatment of deceased and incurred Rs.50,000/- on transportation of dead body, funeral and last rites of the deceased. No claim of any kind was given to the claimants. 3The second claim petition reveals the similar facts of accident as already elaborated and rests of facts are that soon after the accident, injured was taken to General Hospital, Yamuna Nagar, where s he remained admitted as Indoor patient for about 4 days. The treatment is still going on from Shasan Hospital, Ambala City as outdoor patient. The claimant suffered multiple and grievous injuries on her legs, head arms, face, disfigured and other injuries on all the body. During this period, she had spent more than Rs.1,00,000/- on her treatment and still more amount is to be spent on her future treatment etc as she has not properly cured. The claimant has spent a sum of Rs.30,000/- on special diet and VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 5 conveyance etc. Due to this accident, the claimant could not perform her routine work as she received injuries on her head, arms and legs. The claimant could not join her duties for two months due to the injuries suffered in the accident. The injured was 36 years of age at the time of accident. Prior to this accident, she was regularly doing her job and she had to suffer a lot and she could not do her duties and could not earn her income of Rs.25,000/- per month from the date of accident for two months. The injuries sustained by the claimant in the accident has decreased the span of her morality and she was not in a position to do her duties, which requires lot of energy, activeness and physical fitness and the same has caused her an irreparable loss and injuries. No claim of any kind was given to the claimants. The accident took place due to sole rash and negligence of driver of Offending truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596. On the basis of statement of Amit Kumar, FIR No. 294 dated 14.12.2014 under section 279, 337, 427, 304-A IPC was registered in Police Station, Bilaspur against the respondent No.1. Since, the vehicle in question was owned by respondent No.2 and was insured with respondent No.3 at the day of accident and as such all respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation, hence, the petitions. 4Notice of both petition were given to the respondents. Respondent no.1 and 3 have put in appearance and filed written statement controverting the assertions made in the petitions. They took some preliminary objections qua maintainability, concealment of true and VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 6 material facts; that no accident took place with the alleged truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596, however, a criminal case of accident was got registered against the answering respondent No.1 in connivance with the claimant and the police just to get compensation; that claim petitions are bad for mis-joinder and non-joinder of necessary parties; the driver owner and insurer of alleged Maruti Car bearing registration No. HR- 01R-3440 have not been impleaded in the claim petitions being necessary parties and in their absence, the claim petitions are liable to be dismissed. On merit, it is submitted alleged injured might have suffered injuries in the accident by some unknown vehicle, which number could not be noted down. The income of the claimant shown is much excessive to the knowledge of claimant herself. The claimant had not suffered any alleged injury or fractures by the vehicle allegedly involved in this accident. The truck of respondent No.2 has been falsely implicated out of greed just to get compensation from the answering respondents. More over the amount alleged to have been spent on the alleged treatment is much excessive to the knowledge of claimant herself. Since no accident took place with the truck in question, so, the claimants are not entitled to any compensation from the answering respondents. However, it is submitted that answering respondent No.1 has been falsely implicated in the claim petitions just to grab compensation on the basis of false FIR, which was got lodged in connivance with the police and prayed for dismissal the same with costs. 5The respondent No. 3 filed separate written statement controverting the assertions made in the petition and took some VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 7 preliminary objections that petition qua answering respondent is ex-facie, misconceived, vexatious, untenable and devoid of any merit; no accident has taken place with alleged truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z- 8596, however, the present claim petitions have been filed just to extract compensation from the answering respondent by falsely impleading the said vehicle and its driver in the present case on the basis of a concocted and manipulated version by creating and managing false evidence and by introducing a manipulated witness as well; that if the cause of action is proved, even then, the answering insurance company is not liable to indemnify the owner of the truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596 qua the alleged accident since the driver of the alleged truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596 was not having a valid and effective driving licence, permit/authorization and fitness at the time of alleged accident and thus was driving the same in violation of the terms and conditions of insurance policy; that if it is presumed though not admitted that any accident had taken place on the aforesaid date, even then the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation since the deceased suffered the alleged injuries and death due to sole rash and negligent driving of car No. HR-01R-3440 by its driver at fast and uncontrollable speed without caring rules and traffic on the road; that claim petitions are bad for mis joinder and non joinder of necessary parties; that answering respondent takes all the pleas available under sections 147, 149 (2), 157 & 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act. On merit, it is submitted on the similar lines as taken in the preliminary objections and VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 8 prayed for dismissal of claim petitions with costs. 6At the time of framing of issues, both the claim petitions were consolidated. Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following consolidated issues were framed vide order dated 05.11.2015:- 1.Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1 while driving Truck bearing Registration No.HR-38-Z-8596 resulting into causing death of Baby Mannat and injuries to claimant Vijay Gulati, as alleged? OPP. 2If Issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom, the claimants are entitled to ? OPP. 3Whether petitions are not maintainable in the present form ? OPR 4Whether the petitioners have not come to the court with clean hands and have suppressed true and material facts from the court ? OPR 5Whether petitions are bad for non joinder and mis joinder of necessary parties ? OPR 6Whether respondent No.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect ? OPR 7Whether respondent No.3 is entitled to take all the defences available to it under the M. V . Act ? OPR 8Relief. 7 To substantiate their claim, petitioners-claimants examined Smt Vijay Gulati as PW1, who tendered affidavit Ex.PW1/A reiterating the averments made in the petition. In cross-examination, she answered that she was sitting on the front seat of car by the side of driver. They were coming back after attending a Jagran in the night of 13/14.12.2014. The VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 9 offending truck came from opposite direction. Front portion of the car got damaged in the accident. The front driver side of the truck struck against their car. The accident took place at the mettled road. Her cousin namely Amit was coming behind on his motorcycle. The police had arrived at the spot in her presence. She was semi conscious on the arrival of the police. She was shifted to the hospital and the other proceedings were done by her cousin Amit at the spot before the police. It is wrong to suggest that accident took place on the middle of the road or that the accident in question occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of the car. It is incorrect that their car went on the wrong side of the road or that hit the truck which was coming at a normal speed and on its correct side of the road. It is incorrect that they lodged a false complaint against the truck driver taking advantage of the casualty in their car and in order to save their car driver from civil and criminal liability in connivance with police in order to get compensation from the insurance company of the truck. She had not taken any claim from any other source or authority with regard to the present claims. She took treatment from Mukand Lal General Hospital, Yamuna Nagar. She had not suffered any fracture on her person. It is incorrect that she spent nothing upon her treatment or that she was only kept under observation. Learned counsel for the claimants tendered the documents i.e Copy of FIR as Ex.P1; Copy of MLR of Mannat Ex.P2; copy of PMR of Mannat Ex.P3; Death certificate of Mannat Ex.P4; Copy of Aadhar card of Charanjit Singh Ex.P5; Copy of Aadhar Card of Vijay Gulati Ex.P6; Certificate of leave of Vijay Gulati as VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 10 Ex.P9, Copy of Medical report of Vijay as Ex.P10; copy of MLR of Vijay Gulati as ExP11 & Ex.P15; medical bills Ex.P12 and Ex.P13 , Copy of PAN card of Vijay Gulati as Ex.P14, copy of report under section 173 Cr.P.C as Ex.P16 and closed the evidence. On the other hand, Learned counsel for respondent No.3 tendered copy of site plan as Ex.R1 and copies of mechanical reports as Ex.R2 and Ex.R3 and the evidence of respondent No.3 was closed by court order. Further, learned counsel for Respondent no. 1 and 2 has tendered documents copy of RC as Ex.R4; National Permit Ex.R5, Ex.R6 and Ex.R7; Pollution certificate Ex.R8; fitness certificate Ex.R9, Driving licence Ex.R10, Passenger and goods taxation slip Ex.R11, Insurance policy as Ex.R12 and closed their evidence. No rebuttal evidence was led . 8I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1 : 9 Under this issue, petitioners- claimants are required to prove the fact that motor vehicular accident was occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Respondent no.1 while driving truck bearing registration number HR-38-Z-8596, resulting death of Baby Mannat aged 3/½ and causing injuries to second claimant Vijay Gulati and as such the claimants are entitled to appropriate compensation from respondents. 10 Learned counsel for the petitioners-claimants has argued that four persons were travelling in the accidental car and they all sustained injuries, but minor daughter Mannat and brother Naveen Gulati VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 11 were succumbed to their injuries and she and her mother sustained injuries, mother of Vijay Gulati has already instituted claim petition before MACT Jagadhri and petitioner Vijay Gulati is settled in District Ambala, therefore, she has instituted both claim petition. He further argued that factum of accident is well proved. Further, Smt.Vijay Gulati remained hospitalized w.e.f. 14.12.2014 to 18.12.2014 in Civil Hospital and private hospital. She spent amount on her medical treatment. The age of Smt. Vijay Gulati is 36 years and so multiplier of 15 by considering notional income of minor deceased be applied and prayed for allowing these claim petitions. In support to his contentions, he has placed reliance upon Smt. Sushma and Anr. Vs. State of Haryana and Ors., 2014 (2) RCR (Civil) 452 (P&H) , wherein it has been observed that Fatal accident- Death of child- Compensation-Deceased aged 3 years, daughter of appellant, died in road accident- Ld. Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs.50,000/-, as compensation- Income of child taken as 30000/- per annum and applying the multiplier of 15, according to the age of the parents of the deceased, awarded a sum of Rs.4,50,000/- plus Rs.50,000/- under conventional heads- Compensation enhanced. 11On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents No.1 and 2 has vehemently argued that no accident took place with the offending vehicle and false and frivolous FIR has been lodged. However, respondent No.2 was holding valid documents Ex.R4 to Ex.R9 while plying the vehicle at the relevant date. Further, respondent No.1 was holding valid driving licence Ex.R10 and so if any, compensation is VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 12 awarded, then respondent No.3 insurance company is liable to indemnify the claimants as per insurance policy Ex.R10 and prayed for dismissal these claim petitions qua them. 12On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent No.3 has vehemently argued that petitioner Vijay Gulati is working as Lecturer and is earning handsome salary and so she cannot be treated as dependent upon the income of minor deceased and so authority relied upon by counsel for claimants is not applicable to these petitions. He further argued that if any minor is died in road accident, then it is appropriate to award lump sum amount like 'No fault liability' to the extent of Rs.50,000/- maximum on account of death of minor and prayed for dismissal the instant claim petitions. 13 I have given due regard to the rival contentions put forth by learned counsel for respective parties and have evaluated the entire oral evidence coupled with documentary evidence carefully. After thorough examination, it is observed that the petitioners-claimants have come to this Tribunal with categorical stand that the accident was taken place due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle no. HR-38-Z-8596 by Respondent No.1, resulting into death of Baby Mannat and causing injuries to Smt. Vijay Gulati. In order to prove factum of accident, PW1 Vijay Gulati {injured/eye witness} categorically stated through affidavit Ex.PW1/A with regard to factum of accident, which was occurred due to sole rash and negligent act of the respondent No.1 while driving truck bearing registration No. HR-38-Z-8596 on public road, so as to endanger human VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 13 life and safety. She was cross examined, but nothing can be extracted disbelieving factum of non involvement of offending vehicle in the motor vehicular accident, rather, no suggestion was even put forth with regard to manipulation while lodging FIR against respondent No.1. In this way, statement of eye witness/injured PW1 can not be doubted from any angle relating to the motor vehicular accident, particularly when her statement is corroborated with documentary evidence like Copy of FIR as Ex.P1; Copy of MLR of Mannat Ex.P2; copy of PMR of Mannat Ex.P3; death certificate of Mannat Ex.P4 and final report prepared u/s 173 CRPC as EX/P16. It may not be out of place to mention here that despite availing opportunities, respondents did not examine driver of offending vehicle to rebut the versions of PW1 reasons best known to them. Mere denial of rash and negligence at the behest of respondents after causing accident resulting death of a minor baby and causing injuries to Smt Vijay Gulati, are not found sufficient at all, rather, if there was no rash and negligent act at behest of driver, then driver could easily appear in the witness box to rebut the stand taken by claimants-petitioners. However, no reason has been assigned for non-examination of the driver of vehicle by Respondent no.1 and 2. In accident cases, it may collect the first hand report from the driver. It may also be said that the driver does not always speak the truth, but the driver's version is the one which is to be given the best consideration. He also knows that as to what actually happened and if the driver has not been examined, then an adverse inference must be drawn against him. To that effect, reliance can be placed on ruling Raju and VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 14 others versus Sukhvinder Singh and others, 2006(4)RCR(civil) 82 (P&H). 14It is quite well settled that the lodging of the first information report is not an essential prerequisite for claiming compensation arising from a motor accident. Each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The Tribunal is expected to adjudge a case on the basis of the evidence produced without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled position of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. It must be remembered that in a motor accident claim, the claimants are not required to prove their case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. It is trite law that claimants-petitioners are required to prove its case, which sets up the particular case relating to the accident which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts upon the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way as alleged by the claimants. The provisions with regard to claim under the Act are enacted keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimants are always entitled for compensation irrespective whether the police has registered the offence regarding the incident or not because no claim case can be left over on the mercy of the police. 15 The evidence brought on record irrefutably leads to the inference in terms of unrebutted evidence at the instance of petitioners VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 15 that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1, resulting in death of baby mannat and injuries attributed to Smt Vijay Gulati. Since the respondent No.1 has been facing trial as per final report EX.P16 under section 279, 337, 304 A and 427 of IPC before Jagadhari Court, therefore, in view of the law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993 (2) P .L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008 (2) R.C.R. (Civil) 774 , it can be safely held that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1. Accordingly, this issue no.1 is decided in favour of the claimants. ISSUE NO. 2: 16 Onus to prove this issue is upon claimants. PW1 has categorically stated that her daughter was died on account of injuries suffered by her in a motor vehicular accident. The age of deceased Mannat was 3½ years at the day of accident on 14.12.2014. In view of case law titled as Smt. Sushma and Anr. Vs. State of Haryana and Ors., 2014 (2) RCR (Civil) 452 (P&H) supra and multiplier of 15 according to age of parents are applied by taking into consideration the notional income of Rs.30000/- annually after due deduction of 50 percent amount on her personal livings, expenses etc, the exact assessment of compensation would come to {30000x15= 4,50,000 minus fifty percent} Rs.2,25,000/-. Additionally, petitioners being parents have deprived from love and affection and also suffered pain, agony due to untimely death of their minor daughter, therefore, they are entitled to Rs.50,000/- in that VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 16 head. They have also spent amount on last rites/funeral of deceased and so they are entitled to funeral expenses amounting Rs.20,000/-. In this manner, a total compensation is computed to Rs.2,95,000/- which shall be payable along with interest @ 7.5/- per annum from the date of filing the petition till its realization to the petitioners. Rests of relief sought by petitioners-claimants stands declined. In this way first claimants are entitled to Rs.2,95,000/- along with interest @ 7.5/- per annum from the date of filing the petition till its realization in equal share. Accordingly, issue no.2 is decided in favour of claimants-petitioners. 17 So far as second claim petition is concerned; it is evident that claimant Smt Vijay Gulati received injuries in the accident . She did not sustain any permanent disability. In the instant case, claimant has produced medicine bills EX.P12 to EXP13 showing expenses of Rs 2661/- {in round figure 3000/-}. She remained hospitalized for one day as per patient information slip EX.P15 in M.L.G.H and Trauma Centre, Yamunagar. Although She availed leave from 15 December 2014 to 31 January 2015 as per letter EX.P9 issued by employer, but it would not show that she remained on medical leave for that period. According to version of petitioner coupled with medical evidence and i n view of the law settled in Raj Kumar Vs Ajay Kumar, (2011)1 SCC 343 , the petitioner is held entitled to the following compensation: Pecuniary damages (Special damages) (i).Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization in PGI, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and RS.3000/-medical expenses plus 1000/- as indoor patient including VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 17 miscellaneous expenditure. other expenses. (ii).Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising: (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment; (b) Loss of future earning on account of injuries etc. nil nil (iii). Future medical expenses. 5000/- None-pecuniary damages (General damages) (iv). Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries. RS. 5 ,000/- (v). Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage). nil (vi).Loss of expectation of life ( shortening of normal longevity). Nil. Total Compensation Rs.,14,000/- 18 In this way, second-claimant is held entitled to comenstaion of Rs.9,000/- along with interest @ 7.5% per annumfrom the date of filing of petition till realization of awarded amount, which is quite fair, just and reasonable. Rests of relief sought by petitioner-claimant stands declined. Accordingly, In view of above discussions, Issue no.2 is decided in the above stated terms, in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.3 to 5 & 7: 19 The onus to prove these issues are upon Respondents but they neither pressed these issues nor led any evidence. However, it has already discussed in detail under Issue No.1 & 2 that accident was occurred due to rash ad negligent driving of respondent no.1. In this way, it has become obvious on file that this tribunal has left with no other VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 18 option except to decide these issues against Respondents. Accordingly, these issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.6: 20 Coming to question of liability, where under, onus to prove is upon the respondent No.2, who is under the obligation to prove this fact that the respondent No.1 was not holding valid or genuine driving licence to drive offending vehicle at the day of alleged accident and as such driver cum insurer has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. However, there is nothing on record as per evidence that respondent No.1 was not holding any valid license rather same is proved as Ex.R10. Further offending vehicle as per RC as Ex.R4 supported with documents National Permit Ex.R5, Ex.R6 and Ex.R7; Pollution certificate Ex.R8; fitness certificate Ex.R9, Passenger and goods taxation slip Ex.R11,was fit to ply on public road. Not only this, Insurance Policy Ex.R12 reveals that accidental vehicle as per RC EX.R4 was insured with the respondent No.3 at the day of the alleged accident. There is nothing brought to notice of this tribunal that the Driving licence Ex.R10 was not valid on the date of the occurrence. Therefore, in the said circumstances, it is quite clear that the respondent No.2 did not violate or breach the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. Accordingly, this Issue is decided against the respondent No.3. ISSUE NO.8 (RELIEF): petitions succeed ; 21 In view of the foregoing discussion, all both petition are allowed with cost. In first claim petition, claimants-petitioners of first petition are VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 19 entitled to compensation of Rs.2,95,000/- along with interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this claim petition till the date of actual payment in equal share and their amount be deposited in FDR in any nationalized bank for two years and thereafter same be disbursed to them. In S econd claim petition , claimant -petitioner is entitled to compensation of Rs.14,000/- along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this claim petition till the date of actual payment.

Shri Narender Batra, Counsel for the respondent No.1 & 2. Shri Mohinder Bindal, Counsel for the respondent No.3. AWARD:- This award shall dispose of aforesaid two claim petitions titled as Vijay Gulati etc Vs Ramesh Bhardwaj etc (hereinafter referred to as “First Petition”) and titled as Vijay Gulati Vs Ramesh Bhardwaj etc (hereinafter referred to as “Second Petition”). Both the claim petitions are relating to one accident. Claimants of first petition sought compensation of Rs. 10,00,000/- on account of death of their minor daughter Baby Mannat and claimant of second petition sought compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- on account of injuries suffered by her i n motor vehicular accident on 14.12.2014, which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596 by the VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 3 respondent No.1, who is driver of accidental vehicle and at the relevant time, the vehicle in question was owned with respondent No.2 and was insured with the respondent no.3. 2The relevant facts leading to claim petitions are that on 13.12.2014, Baby Mannat, {since deceased} in the company of her mother-claimant No1 and other relatives went to Chhachhrauli in Jagran at the house of their relative. On 14.12.2014 at about 1.00 PM, the deceased along with her mother and other family members were coming back to her house at Baldev Nagar in a Maruti car bearing registration No. HR-01-R-3440 'being driven by Naveen Gulati on his correct side and in a very normal speed and at about 1.30 PM, when they reached near bus stand Kurali Bilaspur- Sadhaura road, in the meantime, a truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596 came from Sadhaura side, being driven by its driver in a rash and negligent manner and in a very high speed and without caring the traffic rules, struck the truck with the car after coming on the wrong side, due to this impact Naveen Gulati died on the spot. Due to the said accident, the front portion of the car was totally damaged, besides this, the deceased and other occupant of the car got serious injuries/multiple injuries. The deceased suffered injuries and was taken to Civil Hospital Yamuna Nagar and thereafter to Gaba Hospital, where she expired. The respondent No.1 was driving the truck in a very high speed, rashly and negligently that caused the serious injuries to the deceased and other occupant of the car, unfortunately, the daughter of the claimant namely Mannat has expired and the claimant No.1 also suffered the VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 4 injuries and was taken to civil hospital Yamuna Nagar in a ambulance and during course of treatment the only daughter of claimant had expired due to the injuries suffered in the accident. The accident was witnessed by Amit Kumar son of Joginder Lal, who was following the car on his motorcycle and other persons gathered at the spot. The deceased was very brilliant in studies and due to untimely death of Mannat, all their life have come into dark. It is further pleaded that deceased was the only child of the claimants and was studying in the good school and was a very brilliant student and used to gave all the love and affection of the claimant and deceased was the only hope of the claimants. The claimants have also spent more than Rs.,25,000/- on treatment of deceased and incurred Rs.50,000/- on transportation of dead body, funeral and last rites of the deceased. No claim of any kind was given to the claimants. 3The second claim petition reveals the similar facts of accident as already elaborated and rests of facts are that soon after the accident, injured was taken to General Hospital, Yamuna Nagar, where s he remained admitted as Indoor patient for about 4 days. The treatment is still going on from Shasan Hospital, Ambala City as outdoor patient. The claimant suffered multiple and grievous injuries on her legs, head arms, face, disfigured and other injuries on all the body. During this period, she had spent more than Rs.1,00,000/- on her treatment and still more amount is to be spent on her future treatment etc as she has not properly cured. The claimant has spent a sum of Rs.30,000/- on special diet and VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 5 conveyance etc. Due to this accident, the claimant could not perform her routine work as she received injuries on her head, arms and legs. The claimant could not join her duties for two months due to the injuries suffered in the accident. The injured was 36 years of age at the time of accident. Prior to this accident, she was regularly doing her job and she had to suffer a lot and she could not do her duties and could not earn her income of Rs.25,000/- per month from the date of accident for two months. The injuries sustained by the claimant in the accident has decreased the span of her morality and she was not in a position to do her duties, which requires lot of energy, activeness and physical fitness and the same has caused her an irreparable loss and injuries. No claim of any kind was given to the claimants. The accident took place due to sole rash and negligence of driver of Offending truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596. On the basis of statement of Amit Kumar, FIR No. 294 dated 14.12.2014 under section 279, 337, 427, 304-A IPC was registered in Police Station, Bilaspur against the respondent No.1. Since, the vehicle in question was owned by respondent No.2 and was insured with respondent No.3 at the day of accident and as such all respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation, hence, the petitions. 4Notice of both petition were given to the respondents. Respondent no.1 and 3 have put in appearance and filed written statement controverting the assertions made in the petitions. They took some preliminary objections qua maintainability, concealment of true and VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 6 material facts; that no accident took place with the alleged truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596, however, a criminal case of accident was got registered against the answering respondent No.1 in connivance with the claimant and the police just to get compensation; that claim petitions are bad for mis-joinder and non-joinder of necessary parties; the driver owner and insurer of alleged Maruti Car bearing registration No. HR- 01R-3440 have not been impleaded in the claim petitions being necessary parties and in their absence, the claim petitions are liable to be dismissed. On merit, it is submitted alleged injured might have suffered injuries in the accident by some unknown vehicle, which number could not be noted down. The income of the claimant shown is much excessive to the knowledge of claimant herself. The claimant had not suffered any alleged injury or fractures by the vehicle allegedly involved in this accident. The truck of respondent No.2 has been falsely implicated out of greed just to get compensation from the answering respondents. More over the amount alleged to have been spent on the alleged treatment is much excessive to the knowledge of claimant herself. Since no accident took place with the truck in question, so, the claimants are not entitled to any compensation from the answering respondents. However, it is submitted that answering respondent No.1 has been falsely implicated in the claim petitions just to grab compensation on the basis of false FIR, which was got lodged in connivance with the police and prayed for dismissal the same with costs. 5The respondent No. 3 filed separate written statement controverting the assertions made in the petition and took some VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 7 preliminary objections that petition qua answering respondent is ex-facie, misconceived, vexatious, untenable and devoid of any merit; no accident has taken place with alleged truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z- 8596, however, the present claim petitions have been filed just to extract compensation from the answering respondent by falsely impleading the said vehicle and its driver in the present case on the basis of a concocted and manipulated version by creating and managing false evidence and by introducing a manipulated witness as well; that if the cause of action is proved, even then, the answering insurance company is not liable to indemnify the owner of the truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596 qua the alleged accident since the driver of the alleged truck bearing Registration No. HR-38-Z-8596 was not having a valid and effective driving licence, permit/authorization and fitness at the time of alleged accident and thus was driving the same in violation of the terms and conditions of insurance policy; that if it is presumed though not admitted that any accident had taken place on the aforesaid date, even then the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation since the deceased suffered the alleged injuries and death due to sole rash and negligent driving of car No. HR-01R-3440 by its driver at fast and uncontrollable speed without caring rules and traffic on the road; that claim petitions are bad for mis joinder and non joinder of necessary parties; that answering respondent takes all the pleas available under sections 147, 149 (2), 157 & 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act. On merit, it is submitted on the similar lines as taken in the preliminary objections and VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 8 prayed for dismissal of claim petitions with costs. 6At the time of framing of issues, both the claim petitions were consolidated. Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following consolidated issues were framed vide order dated 05.11.2015:- 1.Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1 while driving Truck bearing Registration No.HR-38-Z-8596 resulting into causing death of Baby Mannat and injuries to claimant Vijay Gulati, as alleged? OPP. 2If Issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom, the claimants are entitled to ? OPP. 3Whether petitions are not maintainable in the present form ? OPR 4Whether the petitioners have not come to the court with clean hands and have suppressed true and material facts from the court ? OPR 5Whether petitions are bad for non joinder and mis joinder of necessary parties ? OPR 6Whether respondent No.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect ? OPR 7Whether respondent No.3 is entitled to take all the defences available to it under the M. V . Act ? OPR 8Relief. 7 To substantiate their claim, petitioners-claimants examined Smt Vijay Gulati as PW1, who tendered affidavit Ex.PW1/A reiterating the averments made in the petition. In cross-examination, she answered that she was sitting on the front seat of car by the side of driver. They were coming back after attending a Jagran in the night of 13/14.12.2014. The VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 9 offending truck came from opposite direction. Front portion of the car got damaged in the accident. The front driver side of the truck struck against their car. The accident took place at the mettled road. Her cousin namely Amit was coming behind on his motorcycle. The police had arrived at the spot in her presence. She was semi conscious on the arrival of the police. She was shifted to the hospital and the other proceedings were done by her cousin Amit at the spot before the police. It is wrong to suggest that accident took place on the middle of the road or that the accident in question occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of the car. It is incorrect that their car went on the wrong side of the road or that hit the truck which was coming at a normal speed and on its correct side of the road. It is incorrect that they lodged a false complaint against the truck driver taking advantage of the casualty in their car and in order to save their car driver from civil and criminal liability in connivance with police in order to get compensation from the insurance company of the truck. She had not taken any claim from any other source or authority with regard to the present claims. She took treatment from Mukand Lal General Hospital, Yamuna Nagar. She had not suffered any fracture on her person. It is incorrect that she spent nothing upon her treatment or that she was only kept under observation. Learned counsel for the claimants tendered the documents i.e Copy of FIR as Ex.P1; Copy of MLR of Mannat Ex.P2; copy of PMR of Mannat Ex.P3; Death certificate of Mannat Ex.P4; Copy of Aadhar card of Charanjit Singh Ex.P5; Copy of Aadhar Card of Vijay Gulati Ex.P6; Certificate of leave of Vijay Gulati as VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 10 Ex.P9, Copy of Medical report of Vijay as Ex.P10; copy of MLR of Vijay Gulati as ExP11 & Ex.P15; medical bills Ex.P12 and Ex.P13 , Copy of PAN card of Vijay Gulati as Ex.P14, copy of report under section 173 Cr.P.C as Ex.P16 and closed the evidence. On the other hand, Learned counsel for respondent No.3 tendered copy of site plan as Ex.R1 and copies of mechanical reports as Ex.R2 and Ex.R3 and the evidence of respondent No.3 was closed by court order. Further, learned counsel for Respondent no. 1 and 2 has tendered documents copy of RC as Ex.R4; National Permit Ex.R5, Ex.R6 and Ex.R7; Pollution certificate Ex.R8; fitness certificate Ex.R9, Driving licence Ex.R10, Passenger and goods taxation slip Ex.R11, Insurance policy as Ex.R12 and closed their evidence. No rebuttal evidence was led . 8I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1 : 9 Under this issue, petitioners- claimants are required to prove the fact that motor vehicular accident was occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Respondent no.1 while driving truck bearing registration number HR-38-Z-8596, resulting death of Baby Mannat aged 3/½ and causing injuries to second claimant Vijay Gulati and as such the claimants are entitled to appropriate compensation from respondents. 10 Learned counsel for the petitioners-claimants has argued that four persons were travelling in the accidental car and they all sustained injuries, but minor daughter Mannat and brother Naveen Gulati VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 11 were succumbed to their injuries and she and her mother sustained injuries, mother of Vijay Gulati has already instituted claim petition before MACT Jagadhri and petitioner Vijay Gulati is settled in District Ambala, therefore, she has instituted both claim petition. He further argued that factum of accident is well proved. Further, Smt.Vijay Gulati remained hospitalized w.e.f. 14.12.2014 to 18.12.2014 in Civil Hospital and private hospital. She spent amount on her medical treatment. The age of Smt. Vijay Gulati is 36 years and so multiplier of 15 by considering notional income of minor deceased be applied and prayed for allowing these claim petitions. In support to his contentions, he has placed reliance upon Smt. Sushma and Anr. Vs. State of Haryana and Ors., 2014 (2) RCR (Civil) 452 (P&H) , wherein it has been observed that Fatal accident- Death of child- Compensation-Deceased aged 3 years, daughter of appellant, died in road accident- Ld. Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs.50,000/-, as compensation- Income of child taken as 30000/- per annum and applying the multiplier of 15, according to the age of the parents of the deceased, awarded a sum of Rs.4,50,000/- plus Rs.50,000/- under conventional heads- Compensation enhanced. 11On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents No.1 and 2 has vehemently argued that no accident took place with the offending vehicle and false and frivolous FIR has been lodged. However, respondent No.2 was holding valid documents Ex.R4 to Ex.R9 while plying the vehicle at the relevant date. Further, respondent No.1 was holding valid driving licence Ex.R10 and so if any, compensation is VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 12 awarded, then respondent No.3 insurance company is liable to indemnify the claimants as per insurance policy Ex.R10 and prayed for dismissal these claim petitions qua them. 12On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent No.3 has vehemently argued that petitioner Vijay Gulati is working as Lecturer and is earning handsome salary and so she cannot be treated as dependent upon the income of minor deceased and so authority relied upon by counsel for claimants is not applicable to these petitions. He further argued that if any minor is died in road accident, then it is appropriate to award lump sum amount like 'No fault liability' to the extent of Rs.50,000/- maximum on account of death of minor and prayed for dismissal the instant claim petitions. 13 I have given due regard to the rival contentions put forth by learned counsel for respective parties and have evaluated the entire oral evidence coupled with documentary evidence carefully. After thorough examination, it is observed that the petitioners-claimants have come to this Tribunal with categorical stand that the accident was taken place due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle no. HR-38-Z-8596 by Respondent No.1, resulting into death of Baby Mannat and causing injuries to Smt. Vijay Gulati. In order to prove factum of accident, PW1 Vijay Gulati {injured/eye witness} categorically stated through affidavit Ex.PW1/A with regard to factum of accident, which was occurred due to sole rash and negligent act of the respondent No.1 while driving truck bearing registration No. HR-38-Z-8596 on public road, so as to endanger human VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 13 life and safety. She was cross examined, but nothing can be extracted disbelieving factum of non involvement of offending vehicle in the motor vehicular accident, rather, no suggestion was even put forth with regard to manipulation while lodging FIR against respondent No.1. In this way, statement of eye witness/injured PW1 can not be doubted from any angle relating to the motor vehicular accident, particularly when her statement is corroborated with documentary evidence like Copy of FIR as Ex.P1; Copy of MLR of Mannat Ex.P2; copy of PMR of Mannat Ex.P3; death certificate of Mannat Ex.P4 and final report prepared u/s 173 CRPC as EX/P16. It may not be out of place to mention here that despite availing opportunities, respondents did not examine driver of offending vehicle to rebut the versions of PW1 reasons best known to them. Mere denial of rash and negligence at the behest of respondents after causing accident resulting death of a minor baby and causing injuries to Smt Vijay Gulati, are not found sufficient at all, rather, if there was no rash and negligent act at behest of driver, then driver could easily appear in the witness box to rebut the stand taken by claimants-petitioners. However, no reason has been assigned for non-examination of the driver of vehicle by Respondent no.1 and 2. In accident cases, it may collect the first hand report from the driver. It may also be said that the driver does not always speak the truth, but the driver's version is the one which is to be given the best consideration. He also knows that as to what actually happened and if the driver has not been examined, then an adverse inference must be drawn against him. To that effect, reliance can be placed on ruling Raju and VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 14 others versus Sukhvinder Singh and others, 2006(4)RCR(civil) 82 (P&H). 14It is quite well settled that the lodging of the first information report is not an essential prerequisite for claiming compensation arising from a motor accident. Each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The Tribunal is expected to adjudge a case on the basis of the evidence produced without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled position of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. It must be remembered that in a motor accident claim, the claimants are not required to prove their case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. It is trite law that claimants-petitioners are required to prove its case, which sets up the particular case relating to the accident which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts upon the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way as alleged by the claimants. The provisions with regard to claim under the Act are enacted keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimants are always entitled for compensation irrespective whether the police has registered the offence regarding the incident or not because no claim case can be left over on the mercy of the police. 15 The evidence brought on record irrefutably leads to the inference in terms of unrebutted evidence at the instance of petitioners VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 15 that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1, resulting in death of baby mannat and injuries attributed to Smt Vijay Gulati. Since the respondent No.1 has been facing trial as per final report EX.P16 under section 279, 337, 304 A and 427 of IPC before Jagadhari Court, therefore, in view of the law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993 (2) P .L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008 (2) R.C.R. (Civil) 774 , it can be safely held that the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1. Accordingly, this issue no.1 is decided in favour of the claimants. ISSUE NO. 2: 16 Onus to prove this issue is upon claimants. PW1 has categorically stated that her daughter was died on account of injuries suffered by her in a motor vehicular accident. The age of deceased Mannat was 3½ years at the day of accident on 14.12.2014. In view of case law titled as Smt. Sushma and Anr. Vs. State of Haryana and Ors., 2014 (2) RCR (Civil) 452 (P&H) supra and multiplier of 15 according to age of parents are applied by taking into consideration the notional income of Rs.30000/- annually after due deduction of 50 percent amount on her personal livings, expenses etc, the exact assessment of compensation would come to {30000x15= 4,50,000 minus fifty percent} Rs.2,25,000/-. Additionally, petitioners being parents have deprived from love and affection and also suffered pain, agony due to untimely death of their minor daughter, therefore, they are entitled to Rs.50,000/- in that VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 16 head. They have also spent amount on last rites/funeral of deceased and so they are entitled to funeral expenses amounting Rs.20,000/-. In this manner, a total compensation is computed to Rs.2,95,000/- which shall be payable along with interest @ 7.5/- per annum from the date of filing the petition till its realization to the petitioners. Rests of relief sought by petitioners-claimants stands declined. In this way first claimants are entitled to Rs.2,95,000/- along with interest @ 7.5/- per annum from the date of filing the petition till its realization in equal share. Accordingly, issue no.2 is decided in favour of claimants-petitioners. 17 So far as second claim petition is concerned; it is evident that claimant Smt Vijay Gulati received injuries in the accident . She did not sustain any permanent disability. In the instant case, claimant has produced medicine bills EX.P12 to EXP13 showing expenses of Rs 2661/- {in round figure 3000/-}. She remained hospitalized for one day as per patient information slip EX.P15 in M.L.G.H and Trauma Centre, Yamunagar. Although She availed leave from 15 December 2014 to 31 January 2015 as per letter EX.P9 issued by employer, but it would not show that she remained on medical leave for that period. According to version of petitioner coupled with medical evidence and i n view of the law settled in Raj Kumar Vs Ajay Kumar, (2011)1 SCC 343 , the petitioner is held entitled to the following compensation: Pecuniary damages (Special damages) (i).Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization in PGI, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and RS.3000/-medical expenses plus 1000/- as indoor patient including VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 17 miscellaneous expenditure. other expenses. (ii).Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising: (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment; (b) Loss of future earning on account of injuries etc. nil nil (iii). Future medical expenses. 5000/- None-pecuniary damages (General damages) (iv). Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries. RS. 5 ,000/- (v). Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage). nil (vi).Loss of expectation of life ( shortening of normal longevity). Nil. Total Compensation Rs.,14,000/- 18 In this way, second-claimant is held entitled to comenstaion of Rs.9,000/- along with interest @ 7.5% per annumfrom the date of filing of petition till realization of awarded amount, which is quite fair, just and reasonable. Rests of relief sought by petitioner-claimant stands declined. Accordingly, In view of above discussions, Issue no.2 is decided in the above stated terms, in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.3 to 5 & 7: 19 The onus to prove these issues are upon Respondents but they neither pressed these issues nor led any evidence. However, it has already discussed in detail under Issue No.1 & 2 that accident was occurred due to rash ad negligent driving of respondent no.1. In this way, it has become obvious on file that this tribunal has left with no other VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 18 option except to decide these issues against Respondents. Accordingly, these issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.6: 20 Coming to question of liability, where under, onus to prove is upon the respondent No.2, who is under the obligation to prove this fact that the respondent No.1 was not holding valid or genuine driving licence to drive offending vehicle at the day of alleged accident and as such driver cum insurer has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. However, there is nothing on record as per evidence that respondent No.1 was not holding any valid license rather same is proved as Ex.R10. Further offending vehicle as per RC as Ex.R4 supported with documents National Permit Ex.R5, Ex.R6 and Ex.R7; Pollution certificate Ex.R8; fitness certificate Ex.R9, Passenger and goods taxation slip Ex.R11,was fit to ply on public road. Not only this, Insurance Policy Ex.R12 reveals that accidental vehicle as per RC EX.R4 was insured with the respondent No.3 at the day of the alleged accident. There is nothing brought to notice of this tribunal that the Driving licence Ex.R10 was not valid on the date of the occurrence. Therefore, in the said circumstances, it is quite clear that the respondent No.2 did not violate or breach the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. Accordingly, this Issue is decided against the respondent No.3. ISSUE NO.8 (RELIEF): petitions succeed ; 21 In view of the foregoing discussion, all both petition are allowed with cost. In first claim petition, claimants-petitioners of first petition are VIJAY GULATI VS RAMESH BHARDWAJ ETC 19 entitled to compensation of Rs.2,95,000/- along with interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this claim petition till the date of actual payment in equal share and their amount be deposited in FDR in any nationalized bank for two years and thereafter same be disbursed to them. In S econd claim petition , claimant -petitioner is entitled to compensation of Rs.14,000/- along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this claim petition till the date of actual payment. It is further made clear that entire awarded compensation amount along with the interest shall be payable by respondents and respondent no.3 insurance company shall indemnify the insured.

After the impact the claimant along with Amarjit Singh fell on the road and the claimant suffered multiple injuries on his forehead, chin, right arm and his right leg was fractured and motor cycle was also damaged to a great extent. Respondent no.1 stopped for a while and in the meantime Amarjit Singhnoted the Tata Magic Registration Number and thereafter respondent no.1 took the claimant to Mehandiratta Hospital, Ambala City and left him on the gate of the hospital and ran away from the hospital.

Dismissal of the claim petition was prayed for. 5 Respondent no.3 in its written statement raised preliminary objections regarding maintainability, bad for non joinder and misjoinder of parties, delay in lodging the FIR, collusion between respondents no.1 and 2 and claimant.

In documentary evidence the learned counsel for respondent no.3 has filed the following documents: Ex.R1 to Ex.R11 Documents received through RIT Ex.R12 Attested copy of Insurance policy of offending vehicle. 9 No evidence was led on behalf of respondents no.1 and 2 despite availing opportunities for this purpose and evidence of the respondents no.1 and 2 was closed vide court order dated 26.5.2016. 10 Entire material placed on record has been examined. Learned counsel for the parties have been heard. 11 Issue wise findings are hereunder: ISSUE NO.1 : 12. In order to prove this issue petitioner Avtar Singh himself appeared in the witness box as PW2 and filed his affidavit Ex.PW2/A stating there in that on 20.5.2015 at about 11 a.m. he alongwith Amarjit Singh went to Ambala City for purchasing disposable glass for Bhandara and after purchasing the same they were coming on their motor cycle bearing registration number HR 01AB-9809 to their village Dhurala and the motorcycle was being driven by Amarjit Singh and he was pillion rider and when they reached in village Matehri Jattan at about 11.30 a.m. in the meanwhile a loaded Tata Magic Truck bearing number HR-45B- 1894 came from behind in a very rash and negligent manner and struck against the motor cycle from behind. After the impact he alongwith Amarjit Singh fell on the road and he suffered multiple injuries on his forehead,chin, right arm and his right leg was fractured and motor cycle was also damaged to the great extent. Amarjit Singh noted the number of the truck and and respondent no.1 took the injured to Mehandiratta Hospital, Ambala City and left him on the gate and thereafter ran away from the hospital. He got treatment qua his injuries in the Mehandiratta Hospital, Ambala City and remained admitted in the hospital for 7 days i.e. from 20.5.2015 to 27.5.2015. On his statement FIR No.0079 dated 21.5.2015 under sections 279/337/338/427 of IPC was recorded at police station Sadar, Ambala City. He has further stated that the accident was caused by the respondent no.1 due to his rash and negligent driving and he is facing trial in the above said FIR in the court of JMIC, Ambala. He has further stated that police impounded the offending vehicle which was lateron released on superdari byu the court and superdaginama was furnished by Shri Somvir-Manager of M/s Raftar Enterprises, GT Road , New Grain Market, Karnal. PW1 Parmal Singh-Criminal Ahlmad has brought the case file titled as State Vs. Sulender Singh bearing FIR No.79 dated 21.5.2015 under sections 279/337/338/427 of IPC pertaining to P.S.Sadar, Ambala City and stated that charge against the accused has been framed on 11.8.2015 under sections 279/337/338/427 of IPC and now case is fixed for prosecution evidence for 7.6.2016. He has further stated that Film of X-ray,Driving Licence of accused as well as RC of the offending vehicle are attached with the criminal case file. 13 On the basis of the above said evidence the learned counsel for the claimant has argued that it is evident that the petitioner while appearing as PW2 has specifically stated that the accident has taken place due to rash and negligent driving of Tata Magic Truck bearing registration number HR-45B-1894 being driven by respondent no.1. He has further argued that it is also evident from the statement of PW1 Parmal Singh- Criminal Ahlmad that FIR No.79 dated 21.05.2015 was registered and in the said FIR the respondent no.1 is facing trial. In support of his arguments he has placed reliance on case titled as Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Shyam and others 1993(2) Punjab Law Reporter 109 wherein it has been held that it is well settled that a presumption is raised when a person is facing trial. 14 Thus,keeping in view the above said circumstances especially statements of PW2 Avtar Singh-claimant-injured and the evidence brought on record with regard to facing of trial under sections 279/337/338/427 of IPC by respondent no.1 in a criminal court, clearly goes to establish that accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 while driving Tata Magic Truck bearing registration number HR-45B- 1894. In this regard a reference can be made to case titled as Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Shyam and others 1993(2) Punjab Law Reporter 109. Thus, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.4 15. Onus to prove this issue was on respondent-insurance company. This issue pertains on the question whether at the time of accident respondents no.1 who was allegedly driving the vehicle involved in the accident was having valid and effective driving licence or not. 16 In order to escape from its liability,it is required for Insurance Company to prove violation of any terms and conditions of the policy on the part of insured i.e. respondent no.2. 17 It has been alleged by the Insurance Company that respondent no.1 i.e. driver was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident. 18 Ex.R2 is the driving licence of the respondent no.1 Sulender Singh. A perusal of the same goes to show that it was issued by Licensing Authority Nagaland and was valid from 18.6.2012 to 17.6.2015 for HTV,HPV only. This period covers the date of accident. 19. It has been submitted by learned counsel for the respondent no.3 that he had applied to the registration authority as is evident from Ex.R1 and said information regarding the driving licence bearing number 30095/TV/2012 issued by the authority on 18.6.2012. In response to said application the Government of Nagaland, Motor Vehicles Department, has informed by way of Ex.R11 wherein it has been stated that no record has been found available in respect of DL No.30095/TV/T/2012 in the name of Sulender Singh in the office of the Department. 20 On the basis of this information Ex.R11 learned counsel for the respondent no.3 has submitted that DL of respondent no.1 has to be considered as fake licence. In support of his arguments he has placed reliance on case titled as Suresh Kumar Vs. Cholamandalam MS General Insurance Co.Ltd. and others, FAO No.1623-2014 ( O & M) decided on 21.3.2014. 21 This contention of the learned counsel for the respondent no.3 has been opposed by learned counsel for the claimant. 22 Having due regards to the contentions raised by learned counsel for the parties, the contention of the learned counsel for the respondent no.3 cannot be accepted because the information Ex.R11 has been placed on record by the counsel though it has been exhibited but it has not been proved as per law because no witness has been summoned from the Transport Authority,Nagaland. Nobody identified the signatures of concerned officer on report. It is well settled that a report or any evidence regarding the licence has to be proved as per the Evidence Act. A reference in this regard may be made to the case titled as M/s The New India Assurance Company Limited Vs. Sunita Rani and others 2013(4) PLR ( P & H) 333 wherein it has been held by the Hon'ble High Court that: “A document, even if received by post, cannot be presumed to have been received from the Licensing Authority and cannot be believed to be a genuine document. The requirement of proving the said document was still there. Insurance Company could nto be absolved of its liability to prove the report and merely putting of exhibited on the same wold not prove it.” 23 As such I have no hesitation in holding that respondent no.3 failed to prove that the driving licence of the respondent no.1 was not valid and effective on the date of accident. As such this issue is decided against the respondent no.3 and in favour of the claimant and respondents no.1 and 2. ISSUE NO.2: 24 This issue pertains to the amount of compensation and by whom it is to be paid to the petitioner. 25 In this regard the petitioner while appearing as PW2 in his affidavit Ex.PW2/A has stated that due to the injuries received in the accident occurred on 20.5.2015 he remained as indoor patient in Dr.Mdehndiratta Hospital for seven days i.e. from 20.5.2015 to 27.5.2015. 26 Dr.R.K.Mehandiratta while appearing as PW3 has deposed that claimant was got admitted in his hospital on 20.5.2015 at 12.15 p.m. with the history of injuries sustained in a road side accident at about 11.30 a.m. On examination and X-rays he was found to be suffering from multiple lacerated wounds and compound fracture both bones of right leg. He was operated upon on the same day. Debridement was done. Internal fixation of right tibia was done with a nail and bolts. Her was discharged on 26.5.2015. Discharge slip is Ex.PW3/1. Bill amounting to Rs.43500/- is Ex.PW3/2 and receipts against this bill are Ex.PW3/3 and Ex.PW3/4. He has further stated that medicines are taken by the patient himself against payment and the patient remained as indoor patient for six days. 27 In this regard the petitioner has placed on record the bills of medicines with regards to his treatment Ex.P2 to Ex.P25 and Ex.PW3/1. Thus, a total sum of the expenses incurred on the treatment of petitioner including the medicines comes out to Rs.64,786/-. Further as he remained admitted in hospital for six days as stated by PW3 Dr.R.K.Mehandiratta and is also evident from Ex.P3/1 Discharge slip issued by Dr.R.K.Mehandiratta. Therefore, he is entitled to Rs.06,000/- for his six days admission in the hospital and for pain and sufferings. Thus, in total he is entitled to Rs.70,786/- which is rounded as Rs.70,800/- (Rs.Seventy Thousand, Eight Hundred only). 28. Ex.R12 is Insurance Policy revealing that offending vehicle i.e. Tata Magic bearing registration number HR-45-B-1894 was insured with respondent no.3 in the name of respondent no.2 for the period w.e.f. 20.11.2014 to 19.11.2015. This period covers the date of accident and as such, it is held that the respondents no.1 to 3 are the respective driver, owner & insurer of the offending vehicle, so all of them are jointly and severally responsible to pay the compensation amount, as assessed by this Tribunal to the petitioner. Issue no.2 is decided accordingly in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.3 29 In view of my findings on issues no.1 and 2 petition of the petitioner is very well maintainable. Hence this issue is decided in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.5(RELIEF): 30. In view of the findings on all the issues as above, the claim petition partly succeeds and is hereby allowed with costs in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents. Compensation of Rs.70,800/- (Rs.Seventy Thousand, Eight Hundred only) along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of institution of the petition till realization is awarded to the petitioner to be paid by respondents no.1to 3 jointly and severally. 31. In order to facilitate the easy release of the amount to the petitioner, it is ordered that respondent no.3-Insurance Company will deposit the amount directly in the name of the petitioner, either by way of account payee cheque or demand draft in the Tribunal. The petitioner will submit the details of his bank account directly to the insurance company under intimation to this tribunal and the cheque/ draft shall be released to the petitioner on an application for release of the same along with payment order in the name of concerned Manager with directions to disburse the amount as per Award and the details mentioned in payment order by Nazir, who shall submit a compliance report, which would be made part of the main file. Ahlmad concerned is directed to check the strict compliance. 32. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.2,200/-. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly. File be consigned to record room after due compliance.

Two petitions regarding injuries cases were consolidated and one petition regarding death of Meenu is individual petition as the same was lagging behind and the evidence was called separately in the same and therefore, it was being tried separately. 2)Brief facts of the claim petitions are that on 30.06.2015 at about 4.30 P.M. the claimant Sandeep Kumar alongwith his wife Meenu (since deceased) and daughter Tanvi were going from village Keshopur to village Kottar Khana, District Yamuna Nagar on motorcycle No.HR-01- AG-4802. The motorcycle was being driven by Sandeep Kumar and Meenu and Tanvi were pillion riders.

Ex.R-9 :Copy of R.C. Ex.R-10 :Fitness Certificate Ex.R-11 & R-12 :Copy of R.C. 10)No evidence in rebuttal was led by the petitioner. 11)I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the material placed on record. My issue-wise finding are given as under:- ISSUE No.1 OF CONSOLIDATE PETITION AND ISSUE NO.1 OF INDIVIDUAL PETITION:- 12)The onus of proving both these issues was on the petitioners. Jagjit Singh, MACT Sandeep Kumar Vs. Surinder etc. 9 Finding of one issue shall have bearing on the other and hence the same are being decided together. To prove the above issues, learned counsel for the petitioners argued that in the accident in question death of Mamta took place while Sandeep Kumar and Tanvi were injured. It was argued that on 30.06.3015 at about 4.30 P.M. Sandeep Kuamr alongwith his wife Mamta and daughter Tanvi were going from village Keshopur to Kottar Khana on a motorcycle No.HR-01-AG-4802 and the motorcycle was driven by Sandeep Kuamr with Mamta and Tanvi riding pillion. A truck No.RJ-14- GB-3856 came from back side driven in a rash and negligent manner by respondent no.1 and struck the truck into the motorcycle resulting in fall of all the three on the road and Mamta suffered head injuries and Sandeep and his daughter Tanvi suffered serious injuries. All of them were taken to the hospital where Mamta was declared as brought dead. The FIR was got registered on the same day on the statement of Sandeep Kumar and it mentions the number of the offending vehicle and the name of the offending driver as respondent no.1 and who was facing trial for the said accident and this has been deposed in the witness box by the petitioner Sandeep Kuamr as PW-2 in the individual petition and consolidated petition and no rebuttal to this has come on the part of the respondents. With regard to the incorrect mentioning of the number of the Jagjit Singh, MACT Sandeep Kumar Vs. Surinder etc. 10 motorcycle driven by the petitioner Sandeep Kumar it was argued that he was in the state of shock after the accident, he could not correctly recollect the number of the motorcycle and wrongly mentioned another motorcycle in his statement but got it corrected in his supplementary statement and the same is Ex.P-9 and seizure memo of the motorcycle is Ex.P-10 and the registration certificate is Ex.P-11 and therefore, it is these documents which are to be considered and not the wrongly mentioned incorrect number of the motorcycle. 13)Learned counsel for the respondents meanwhile argued that no such accident took place and false claim petitions have been filed by the petitioners. It was argued that the documents on file would make it amply clear that no such accident has taken place and the petitioner alongwith his family members was never travelling on the motorcycle alleged by him. It was argued that FIR Ex.P-8 got scribed by the petitioner mentions number of the motorcycle on which he was travelling as HR-37D-0681 and in Ex.P-11 the motorcycle number has been changed to HR-01-AG-4802. It was argued that the supplementary statement got recorded as Ex.P-9 to change the number of the motorcycle cannot be considered since the date of accident was 30.06.2015 and this statement as per the endorsement has been recorded almost a month before the accident on 01.06.2015. Learned counsel further pointed out to the testimony of the Jagjit Singh, MACT Sandeep Kumar Vs. Surinder etc. 11 petitioner as PW-2 wherein in his cross-examination he stated to have remained fully conscious after the accident and having noticed the registration number of the truck and it was argued that this means that the petitioner was well aware about the number of his motorcycle which he mentioned in the FIR and which he lateron tried to change in his statement by saying that he was in state of shock. He further stated to have got recorded his statement to the police correctly and having signed the same after reading over and admitting the same to be correct in his fully senses. He stated to be owner of motorcycle bearing No.HR-01-AG- 4802 but perusal of the file shows the same to be in the name of Om Parkash. He further failed to mention as to who owns the motorcycle No.HR-37D-0681 mentioned in the FIR. He stated to have not joined the investigation of this case after lodging of the FIR till he deposed in the witness box. In his testimony the witness stated that due to shock and strain he wrongly mentioned the number of the motorcycle which was rectified by the police on recording the supplementary statement but this contention about being in a state of shock is not mentioned in the petition. Learned counsel further pointed out to document Ex.P-10 said to be seizure memo of the motorcycle. Perusal of the same showed it to be only seizure memo of registration certificate and same was dated 30.06.2015 and no motorcycle was taken into custody on that date and the seizure memo Ex.R-2 was of the Tralla and dated 30.06.2015. The Jagjit Singh, MACT Sandeep Kumar Vs. Surinder etc. 12 statement of Om Parkash said to be father-in-law of the petitioner regarding the accident is Ex.R-3 and recorded on 27.06.2015, which is three days before the accident wherein he has produced the registration certificate of his motorcycle to the police in connection with the accident which will subsequently happen on 30.06.2015. Keeping in view all these aspects and the several discrepancies in the investigation of the police and the manipulation done by the petitioners it was argued that no such accident ever took place by any tralla driven by respondent no.1 and the entire case being manipulated, the petitions deserve to be dismissed. In support of his arguments, learned counsel placed reliance upon the principles laid down in Habib Vs. Mukesh Kumar & Ors., 2014(1) PLR 750 , where it was held that “ FIR has been lodged by RR who was claimed by the appellant to have been travelling with the injured in the offending three wheeler – If he could see the number of the offending vehicle, he should have seen the number correctly and if the number was seen correctly then it could not be changed later on – There could be a change here and there in the registration number of a vehicle of a digit or letter having similar appearance – Such a change can be expected, but when the change is of the entire number, it cannot be accepted.” Reliance was also placed upon New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Jagjit Singh, MACT Sandeep Kumar Vs. Surinder etc. 13 Vs. G.N. Gopalagowda & Anr., 2006 ACJ 2771 , where it was held that “Narration of accident as per FIR discloses no involvement of auto in the accident – Charge-sheet does not explain divergent and contra material in the FIR to sustain the charge-sheet against auto driver – Claimant who is a police constable has played fraud on the court misusing his official position in connivance with investigating officer in concocting a false case to mulct unlawful liability on the insurance company.” 14)Learned counsel for the petitioners rebutting the arguments of the learned counsel for the respondents argued that the offending vehicle has been described clearly by the petitioner and that was only what was necessary and not the number of the vehicle on which the deceased or the injured were travelling and the respondent no.1 was facing trial for the same and cannot be absolved of his liability and therefore, the petitioners were entitled to compensation, for which reliance was placed upon the principles laid down in Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Sham & Anr., 1993(2) PLR 109, Sudama Devi & Anr. Vs. Kewal Ram & Anr., 2008 PLR 444 and Gurdeep Kaur Vs. Tarsem Singh, 2008(2) RCR (Civil) 775 . 15)I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the file carefully. 16) Perusal of the file shows that the same was initially on the Jagjit Singh, MACT Sandeep Kumar Vs. Surinder etc. 14 happening of accident with the motorcycle on which the petitioner Sandeep Kumar alongwith his wife and daughter were travelling and the accident is said to have been caused by a truck-tralla being driven by respondent no.1. As per his testimony in the witness box the petitioner was in full senses after the accident and he has claimed to have noted down the number of the offending vehicle correctly and having read over his statement made to the police and admitted its correctness, on the basis of which the FIR was registered. Perusal of the FIR Ex.P-8 shows that the petitioner has mentioned that at 4.30 P.M. he was travelling on his motorcycle Mark Splendor bearing No.HR-37D-0681 alongwith his wife Mamta and daughter Tanvi and the truck-tralla caused the accident with the same and the truck was driven by Surinder and the number of his truck was RJ-14-GB-3856. As earlier discussed if the petitioner was in full senses he was bound to have known the number of the motorcycle on which he was travelling since he claims to be owner of the same. Lateron when he filed the petition he nowhere mentions to be ever in a state of shock or that it allegedly resulted in his wrong mentioning of the number of his motorcycle to the police. For the first time he comes up with this plea in his evidence and the same being beyond his pleadings cannot be considered. 17)Further when we peruse the evidence on file as it is claimed Jagjit Singh, MACT Sandeep Kumar Vs. Surinder etc. 15 by the petitioner that in his supplementary statement he had got recorded the correct number of the motorcycle on which he was travelling, then the perusal of the statement Ex.P-9 shows that herein a new number has been incorporated of the motorcycle but this statement has been recorded on 01.06.2015, whereas the accident in question has taken place on 30.06.2015 and how the petitioner was able to get his supplementary statement recorded a month before the accident, has not been explained. The petitioner claims that the motorcycle in question was taken into custody on the date of accident but the seizure memo Ex.P-10 only relates to the registration certificate of the motorcycle and not motorcycle in question. Further perusal of the documents brought on record by the respondent no.3 shows that the truck in question has been taken into custody on 30.06.2015 and statement of one Om Parkash, father-in-law of petitioner was recorded in this accident wherein he has stated that in the accident his daughter died and she was travelling alongwith petitioner on motorcycle No.HR-01-AG-4802 and he produced registration certificate of the same to the police and he had gifted this motorcycle to his son-in- law. This statement has however, been recorded on 27.06.2015 i.e. 3 days before the accident and Ex.P-2 and Ex.P-10 as also discussed was the seizure memo of the registration certificate and which was dated 30.06.2015. Jagjit Singh, MACT Sandeep Kumar Vs. Surinder etc. 16 The statement Ex.R-5 recorded on 01.07.2015 shows that the same Om Parkash, whose statement Ex.R-3 was recorded on 27.06.2015, as per statement Ex.R-5 of HC Manjit Singh he has come to the Police Station on 01.07.2015 and handed over the registration certificate of the motorcycle Mark Splendor bearing No.HR-37D-0681 with which accident had taken place. Now this was the motorcycle which was mentioned by the petitioner in his FIR. Another document Ex.R-6, the date on which cannot be ascertained relates to the handing over of motorcycle No.HR- 01-AG-8402 alongwith its registration certificate to the police and after taking into custody vide this seizure memo but name of the witnesses have been scribbled and are not at all clear. 18)Perusal of these documents makes it amply clear that all is not what meet the eyes and the documents on file clearly go to show that there has been some manipulation in this entire matter resulting in the supplementary statement being recorded a month before the accident and even three days before the accident and therefore, the entire contentions of the petitioners cannot be considered with regard to their travelling either on the motorcycle which was mentioned in the FIR or on the motorcycle in which it is alleged that they were actually travelling and therefore, merely correct number of the tralla having been mentioned would not help the petitioners as the entire evidence is to be seen and hence, the petitioners failed miserably in proving that they were travelling on the Jagjit Singh, MACT Sandeep Kumar Vs. Surinder etc. 17 motorcycle No.HR-01-AG-8402 and the truck bearing No.RJ-14-GB- 3856 driven by respondent no.1 caused the accident with the motorcycle causing injuries to Sandeep Kumar and Tanvi and death of Meena. As a result, both these issues stand decided against the petitioners. ISSUE No.2 OF CONSOLIDATE PETITION AND ISSUE NO.2 OF INDIVIDUAL PETITION:- 19)Keeping in view my findings on issue no.1, the petitioners do not become entitled to any amount of compensation and the issues stand decided against the petitioners. ISSUE No.3 OF CONSOLIDATE PETITION AND ISSUE NO.3 OF INDIVIDUAL PETITION:- 20)Keeping in view of my findings on issues no.1 and 2 and the learned counsel for respondent no.3 not pressing this issue in view of several discrepancies in the testimony of the witnesses and not proving the accident in question, these issue stand decided against the respondent no.3. ISSUE NO. 4(RELIEF):- 21)Keeping in view of my detailed discussion on all the aforesaid issues, both the consolidate petitions as well as individual Jagjit Singh, MACT Sandeep Kumar Vs. Surinder etc. 18 petition stand dismissed. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly. A copy of this judgment be placed in the connected files. File be consigned to record room after due compliance.

My issue-wise finding are given as under:- ISSUE No.1 OF CONSOLIDATE PETITION AND ISSUE NO.1 OF INDIVIDUAL PETITION:- 12)The onus of proving both these issues was on the petitioners. Jagjit Singh, MACT Sandeep Kumar Vs. Surinder etc. 9 Finding of one issue shall have bearing on the other and hence the same are being decided together. To prove the above issues, learned counsel for the petitioners argued that in the accident in question death of Mamta took place while Sandeep Kumar and Tanvi were injured. It was argued that on 30.06.3015 at about 4.30 P.M. Sandeep Kuamr alongwith his wife Mamta and daughter Tanvi were going from village Keshopur to Kottar Khana on a motorcycle No.HR-01-AG-4802 and the motorcycle was driven by Sandeep Kuamr with Mamta and Tanvi riding pillion. A truck No.RJ-14- GB-3856 came from back side driven in a rash and negligent manner by respondent no.1 and struck the truck into the motorcycle resulting in fall of all the three on the road and Mamta suffered head injuries and Sandeep and his daughter Tanvi suffered serious injuries. All of them were taken to the hospital where Mamta was declared as brought dead. The FIR was got registered on the same day on the statement of Sandeep Kumar and it mentions the number of the offending vehicle and the name of the offending driver as respondent no.1 and who was facing trial for the said accident and this has been deposed in the witness box by the petitioner Sandeep Kuamr as PW-2 in the individual petition and consolidated petition and no rebuttal to this has come on the part of the respondents. With regard to the incorrect mentioning of the number of the Jagjit Singh, MACT Sandeep Kumar Vs. Surinder etc. 10 motorcycle driven by the petitioner Sandeep Kumar it was argued that he was in the state of shock after the accident, he could not correctly recollect the number of the motorcycle and wrongly mentioned another motorcycle in his statement but got it corrected in his supplementary statement and the same is Ex.P-9 and seizure memo of the motorcycle is Ex.P-10 and the registration certificate is Ex.P-11 and therefore, it is these documents which are to be considered and not the wrongly mentioned incorrect number of the motorcycle. 13)Learned counsel for the respondents meanwhile argued that no such accident took place and false claim petitions have been filed by the petitioners. It was argued that the documents on file would make it amply clear that no such accident has taken place and the petitioner alongwith his family members was never travelling on the motorcycle alleged by him. It was argued that FIR Ex.P-8 got scribed by the petitioner mentions number of the motorcycle on which he was travelling as HR-37D-0681 and in Ex.P-11 the motorcycle number has been changed to HR-01-AG-4802. It was argued that the supplementary statement got recorded as Ex.P-9 to change the number of the motorcycle cannot be considered since the date of accident was 30.06.2015 and this statement as per the endorsement has been recorded almost a month before the accident on 01.06.2015. Learned counsel further pointed out to the testimony of the Jagjit Singh, MACT Sandeep Kumar Vs. Surinder etc. 11 petitioner as PW-2 wherein in his cross-examination he stated to have remained fully conscious after the accident and having noticed the registration number of the truck and it was argued that this means that the petitioner was well aware about the number of his motorcycle which he mentioned in the FIR and which he lateron tried to change in his statement by saying that he was in state of shock. He further stated to have got recorded his statement to the police correctly and having signed the same after reading over and admitting the same to be correct in his fully senses. He stated to be owner of motorcycle bearing No.HR-01-AG- 4802 but perusal of the file shows the same to be in the name of Om Parkash. He further failed to mention as to who owns the motorcycle No.HR-37D-0681 mentioned in the FIR. He stated to have not joined the investigation of this case after lodging of the FIR till he deposed in the witness box. In his testimony the witness stated that due to shock and strain he wrongly mentioned the number of the motorcycle which was rectified by the police on recording the supplementary statement but this contention about being in a state of shock is not mentioned in the petition. Learned counsel further pointed out to document Ex.P-10 said to be seizure memo of the motorcycle. Perusal of the same showed it to be only seizure memo of registration certificate and same was dated 30.06.2015 and no motorcycle was taken into custody on that date and the seizure memo Ex.R-2 was of the Tralla and dated 30.06.2015. The Jagjit Singh, MACT Sandeep Kumar Vs. Surinder etc. 12 statement of Om Parkash said to be father-in-law of the petitioner regarding the accident is Ex.R-3 and recorded on 27.06.2015, which is three days before the accident wherein he has produced the registration certificate of his motorcycle to the police in connection with the accident which will subsequently happen on 30.06.2015. Keeping in view all these aspects and the several discrepancies in the investigation of the police and the manipulation done by the petitioners it was argued that no such accident ever took place by any tralla driven by respondent no.1 and the entire case being manipulated, the petitions deserve to be dismissed. In support of his arguments, learned counsel placed reliance upon the principles laid down in Habib Vs. Mukesh Kumar & Ors., 2014(1) PLR 750 , where it was held that “ FIR has been lodged by RR who was claimed by the appellant to have been travelling with the injured in the offending three wheeler – If he could see the number of the offending vehicle, he should have seen the number correctly and if the number was seen correctly then it could not be changed later on – There could be a change here and there in the registration number of a vehicle of a digit or letter having similar appearance – Such a change can be expected, but when the change is of the entire number, it cannot be accepted.” Reliance was also placed upon New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Jagjit Singh, MACT Sandeep Kumar Vs. Surinder etc. 13 Vs. G.N. Gopalagowda & Anr., 2006 ACJ 2771 , where it was held that “Narration of accident as per FIR discloses no involvement of auto in the accident – Charge-sheet does not explain divergent and contra material in the FIR to sustain the charge-sheet against auto driver – Claimant who is a police constable has played fraud on the court misusing his official position in connivance with investigating officer in concocting a false case to mulct unlawful liability on the insurance company.” 14)Learned counsel for the petitioners rebutting the arguments of the learned counsel for the respondents argued that the offending vehicle has been described clearly by the petitioner and that was only what was necessary and not the number of the vehicle on which the deceased or the injured were travelling and the respondent no.1 was facing trial for the same and cannot be absolved of his liability and therefore, the petitioners were entitled to compensation, for which reliance was placed upon the principles laid down in Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Sham & Anr., 1993(2) PLR 109, Sudama Devi & Anr. Vs. Kewal Ram & Anr., 2008 PLR 444 and Gurdeep Kaur Vs. Tarsem Singh, 2008(2) RCR (Civil) 775 . 15)I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the file carefully. 16) Perusal of the file shows that the same was initially on the Jagjit Singh, MACT Sandeep Kumar Vs. Surinder etc. 14 happening of accident with the motorcycle on which the petitioner Sandeep Kumar alongwith his wife and daughter were travelling and the accident is said to have been caused by a truck-tralla being driven by respondent no.1. As per his testimony in the witness box the petitioner was in full senses after the accident and he has claimed to have noted down the number of the offending vehicle correctly and having read over his statement made to the police and admitted its correctness, on the basis of which the FIR was registered. Perusal of the FIR Ex.P-8 shows that the petitioner has mentioned that at 4.30 P.M. he was travelling on his motorcycle Mark Splendor bearing No.HR-37D-0681 alongwith his wife Mamta and daughter Tanvi and the truck-tralla caused the accident with the same and the truck was driven by Surinder and the number of his truck was RJ-14-GB-3856. As earlier discussed if the petitioner was in full senses he was bound to have known the number of the motorcycle on which he was travelling since he claims to be owner of the same. Lateron when he filed the petition he nowhere mentions to be ever in a state of shock or that it allegedly resulted in his wrong mentioning of the number of his motorcycle to the police. For the first time he comes up with this plea in his evidence and the same being beyond his pleadings cannot be considered. 17)Further when we peruse the evidence on file as it is claimed Jagjit Singh, MACT Sandeep Kumar Vs. Surinder etc. 15 by the petitioner that in his supplementary statement he had got recorded the correct number of the motorcycle on which he was travelling, then the perusal of the statement Ex.P-9 shows that herein a new number has been incorporated of the motorcycle but this statement has been recorded on 01.06.2015, whereas the accident in question has taken place on 30.06.2015 and how the petitioner was able to get his supplementary statement recorded a month before the accident, has not been explained. The petitioner claims that the motorcycle in question was taken into custody on the date of accident but the seizure memo Ex.P-10 only relates to the registration certificate of the motorcycle and not motorcycle in question. Further perusal of the documents brought on record by the respondent no.3 shows that the truck in question has been taken into custody on 30.06.2015 and statement of one Om Parkash, father-in-law of petitioner was recorded in this accident wherein he has stated that in the accident his daughter died and she was travelling alongwith petitioner on motorcycle No.HR-01-AG-4802 and he produced registration certificate of the same to the police and he had gifted this motorcycle to his son-in- law. This statement has however, been recorded on 27.06.2015 i.e. 3 days before the accident and Ex.P-2 and Ex.P-10 as also discussed was the seizure memo of the registration certificate and which was dated 30.06.2015. Jagjit Singh, MACT Sandeep Kumar Vs. Surinder etc. 16 The statement Ex.R-5 recorded on 01.07.2015 shows that the same Om Parkash, whose statement Ex.R-3 was recorded on 27.06.2015, as per statement Ex.R-5 of HC Manjit Singh he has come to the Police Station on 01.07.2015 and handed over the registration certificate of the motorcycle Mark Splendor bearing No.HR-37D-0681 with which accident had taken place. Now this was the motorcycle which was mentioned by the petitioner in his FIR. Another document Ex.R-6, the date on which cannot be ascertained relates to the handing over of motorcycle No.HR- 01-AG-8402 alongwith its registration certificate to the police and after taking into custody vide this seizure memo but name of the witnesses have been scribbled and are not at all clear. 18)Perusal of these documents makes it amply clear that all is not what meet the eyes and the documents on file clearly go to show that there has been some manipulation in this entire matter resulting in the supplementary statement being recorded a month before the accident and even three days before the accident and therefore, the entire contentions of the petitioners cannot be considered with regard to their travelling either on the motorcycle which was mentioned in the FIR or on the motorcycle in which it is alleged that they were actually travelling and therefore, merely correct number of the tralla having been mentioned would not help the petitioners as the entire evidence is to be seen and hence, the petitioners failed miserably in proving that they were travelling on the Jagjit Singh, MACT Sandeep Kumar Vs. Surinder etc. 17 motorcycle No.HR-01-AG-8402 and the truck bearing No.RJ-14-GB- 3856 driven by respondent no.1 caused the accident with the motorcycle causing injuries to Sandeep Kumar and Tanvi and death of Meena. As a result, both these issues stand decided against the petitioners. ISSUE No.2 OF CONSOLIDATE PETITION AND ISSUE NO.2 OF INDIVIDUAL PETITION:- 19)Keeping in view my findings on issue no.1, the petitioners do not become entitled to any amount of compensation and the issues stand decided against the petitioners. ISSUE No.3 OF CONSOLIDATE PETITION AND ISSUE NO.3 OF INDIVIDUAL PETITION:- 20)Keeping in view of my findings on issues no.1 and 2 and the learned counsel for respondent no.3 not pressing this issue in view of several discrepancies in the testimony of the witnesses and not proving the accident in question, these issue stand decided against the respondent no.3. ISSUE NO. 4(RELIEF):- 21)Keeping in view of my detailed discussion on all the aforesaid issues, both the consolidate petitions as well as individual Jagjit Singh, MACT Sandeep Kumar Vs. Surinder etc. 18 petition stand dismissed. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly. A copy of this judgment be placed in the connected files. File be consigned to record room after due compliance.

AWARD :- Petitioner has brought this claim petition under Section 166 MUKESH KUMAR VS. HARBINDER SINGH ETC 2 of the Motor Vehicles Act, for grant of compensation on account of injuries suffered by claimant in a road side accident, which was taken place on 19.05.2015 at about 06:40 PM and FIR No.1346 dated 04.06.2015, under Sections 279 and 337 of IPC was registered against respondent No.1 at Police Station Naraingarh. After the accident, he was taken to PHC Sadhora, from where, he was referred to Mukand Lal General Hospital, Yamuna Nagar on 21.05.2015 and he remained admitted there up to 03.06.2015. He was operated for his fracture in the left knee and leg and also for the other injuries suffered by him in the accident. He is still under treatment and spent more than Rs.1,00,000/- on his treatment, payment to attendant, medicines, special diet and transportation and more is to be spent in future. He was working as labourer and was earning Rs.12,000/- per month and was pulling his family, but due to the injuries suffered by him, he could not join his job and suffered loss of income and his all dreams have been ruined. He is unmarried and his parents was searching for a suitable match, but he suffered disability in his left leg and due to this, the better marriage prospectus has been closed. This accident has been caused due to rash and negligent driving of car bearing Registration No.HR-71-C-3001, which was being driven by respondent no.1 and owned by respondent no.2 and if the vehicle is insured with respondent no.3, then all respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation. This accident occurred near village Gadhauli, Tehsil Naraingarh, District Ambala, hence MUKESH KUMAR VS. HARBINDER SINGH ETC 3 this claim petition has been filed within jurisdiction. Upon notice, respondent no.1 filed written statement inter-alia on preliminary objections regarding non-maintainability of this petition. On merit, it is submitted that a false FIR u/ss 279 and 337 of IPC was registered against respondent no.1, who was not involved in the said accident at any point of time and prayed for dismissal the claim petition. However, respondent no.2 did not appear despite service and he was proceeded against ex parte. It is worth mentioning here that initially respondent no.3 was proceeded against ex parte and thereafter, an application for setting aside ex parte order was allowed and written statement on behalf of respondent no.3 filed with specific plea that respondent no.3 did not issue policy for the relevant period of accident relating to offending vehicle and statement of claimant's counsel in this regard is recorded separately, who stated that name of respondent no.3 be deleted from the array of respondent. In view of fact, further proceedings qua respondent no.3 was struck down. Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following issues are framed vide order dated 27.09.2016:- 1.Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1 while driving Car bearing registration No. HR-71C-3001, resulting into causing injuries to claimant Mukesh Kumar, as alleged ? OPP. 2.If Issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom, the claimants are entitled to ? OPP. 3Whether petition is not maintainable in the present form ? MUKESH KUMAR VS. HARBINDER SINGH ETC 4 OPR 4Whether petitioner has no cause of action to file the present petition ? OPR. 5Relief 2.However, when the case was pending for claimant's evidence, at that time, no one appeared on behalf of respondent no.1 and he was proceeded against ex parte. In exparte evidence, claimant tendered affidavit EX.PW1/A reiterating the averment made in the petition. The following documents were adduced: EX.P1 -Copy of FIR EX.P2 -Application for handicapped certificate EX.P2/A -Disability certificate issued by Board, whereby, 25% disability has been assessed relating to particular ling. EX.P3 to EX.P6 -Copies of treatment chart. EX.P7 -Bill of Rs.4300/- dated 30.08.2015. Mark-A -Copy of MLR. 3.I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1&2 : 4.Both issues can be decided together conveniently. It is argued by counsel for claimant that incident took place due to rash and negligent MUKESH KUMAR VS. HARBINDER SINGH ETC 5 driving of car bearing Registration no. HR-71C-3001 by respondent no.1, as a result of that, claimant sustained multiple injury including 25% permanent disability to the extent of particular limb. It is further argued that respondent no.1 and 2 did not rebut the evidence in any manner and prayed for deciding the Issue no.1 and 2 in favour of claimant and against respondents no.1 and 2. 5.I have considered the rival contentions and have perused the entire evidence meticulously. After thorough examination, it observed that claimant has come to Tribunal with categorical stand that on 19.05.2015 at about 06:40 PM, he was coming back to his house after meeting his sister at village Balmajra, District Ambala on his Platina motorcycle bearing Registration No. HR-04B-8296 and he was driving his motorcycle correct side of the road and at moderate speed. When he reached near village Gadhauli, Naraingarh, in the meantime, a car bearing Registration No.HR-71C-3001 'being driven by its driver so rashly and negligently at a high speed, came and hit him directly and due to this accident, he received severe injuries on his person. While appearing in the witness box as PW1, he tendered affidavit reiterating the averment made in the petition. His statement is corroborated with contents mentioned the FIR which is also unrebutted and unchallenged despite due diligence of respondents no.1 and 2 and that situation, it shall also presume that they both respondents have admitted about factum of incident in toto. 6.It is quite well settled that the lodging of first information MUKESH KUMAR VS. HARBINDER SINGH ETC 6 report is not an essential prerequisite for claiming compensation arising from a motor accident. The Tribunal has to decide the case on the basis of evidence available on file without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled preposition of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. It must be remembered that in a criminal case, prosecution is required to prove its case beyond shadow of reasonable doubt. However, in a motor accident claim, the claimant is not required to prove the case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. The claimant is required to establish that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts upon the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way alleged by the claimant which is apparently missing on record. The provisions regarding claim under the Act are enacted by keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimant is always entitled for compensation irrespective of fact whether the police has registered the offence regarding the incident or not because no claim case can be left over on the mercy of the police. In view of law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993(2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008(2) R.C.R. (civil) 774 , and entire facts and circumstances of petition, this Tribunal is of the considered opinion that there is sufficient evidence on file to reach the MUKESH KUMAR VS. HARBINDER SINGH ETC 7 formidable conclusion that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. Accordingly, issued no.1 is decided against respondent no.1. 7.Coming to Issue no.2 on point of assessment of compensation amount. It is apparent that claimant sustained multiple injuries including 25% permanent disability in his knee as per disability certificate EX.PW2/A. He has spent Rs.4300/- on his medical treatment. Further, he remained admitted in hospital for a period of 12 days and so, he must have born expenses during his admission. In Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences versus Prasanth S.Dhananka, 2010 ACJ 38 (SC) , by the three-Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court, it was observed that sympathy for the victim does not, and should not, come in the way of making a correct assessment, but if a case is made out, the Court must not be chary of awarding adequate compensation. It was further observed that the case of an injured and disabled person is, however, more pitiable and the feeling of hurt, helplessness, despair and often destitution ensues every day. The support that is needed by a severely handicapped person comes at an enormous price, physical, financial and emotional, not only on the victim but even more so on his family and attendants and the stress saps their energy and destroys their equanimity. In Raj Kumar versus Ajay Kumar, 2011 ACJ-1- (SC); it was observed that a person is not only to be compensated for the physical injury, but also for the loss which he suffered as a result of such injury. This means that he is to be MUKESH KUMAR VS. HARBINDER SINGH ETC 8 compensated for his inability to lead a full life, his inability to enjoy those normal amenities which he would have enjoyed but for the injuries, and his inability to earn as much as he used to earn or could have earned. 8.Since he received 25 per cent disability as per disability certificate and therefore in view of extent of physical disability and its nature when examined in the light of Judgment in Ram Kiran Goyal vs Sub Divisional engineer, mechanical and other 2008{2} RCR {Civil} 103, claimant is entitled to Rs.50,000/- @ 2000/- per percent. 9.In the light of overall facts and circumstances arising out in this petition, this Tribunal finds justification in assessing compensation according to injuries attributed to claimant as per settled preposition of law in Raj Kumar Vs Ajay Kumar, (2011)1 SCC 343 , the petitioner- claimant is held entitled to the following compensation: Pecuniary damages (Special damages) 25% permanent disability; Rs.50000/- (i).Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and miscellaneous expenditure.Rs.4300 /-{medicine bills} plus Rs.10000/- including all expenses as per admission. (ii).Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising: (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment; (b) Loss of future earning on account of injuries etc. 5000/- 5 000/- (iii). Future medical expenses. 5000/ - MUKESH KUMAR VS. HARBINDER SINGH ETC 9 None-pecuniary damages (General damages) (iv). Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries. 10 000/- (v). Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage). nil (vi).Loss of expectation of life ( shortening of normal longevity). nil /- Total Compensation Rs.89300/- 10 The petitioner is also entitled to interest @ 7.5% per annum on the total awarded compensation amount from the date of filing of petition till realization. The computation of compensation is just, equitable, fair and reasonable. Remaining relief sought by petitioner- claimant stands declined. Accordingly, Issue no.1&2 are decided in the above stated terms, in favour of the petitioner and against the respondent no.1&2 who are equally, jointly and severally liable to pay compensation amount. ISSUE NO.3 and 4: 11. The onus to prove these issues are upon Respondents, but they neither pressed these issues nor led any evidence. Further it has been discussed in detail under issue no.1, that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and thus it can not be said that no accident was taken place with offending vehicle or the instant claim petition is not maintainable etc. In this way, it has become obvious for this tribunal that respondents have failed to prove these issues and as such this tribunal has left with no other option except to decide the same against Respondents. Accordingly, these issues are decided against MUKESH KUMAR VS. HARBINDER SINGH ETC 10 Respondents. ISSUE NO.5 (RELIEF): PETITION SUCCEED S 12.In view of the foregoing discussion, instant claim petition stands allowed with costs in a manner that the claimant-petitioner is entitled to compensation of Rs.89,300/ - along with interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition till the date of actual payment. The awarded compensation amount along with interest shall be payable jointly and severally by Respondent no.1 &2 to the claimant with in one month respectively. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.3000/-.

Shri Sachin Kumar, counsel for the respondent No.1. Shri Jaswant Singh, G.P for respondent No. 2. Shri Deepak Sharma, counsel for the respondent No.3. AWARD:- Petitioners have brought t his petition U/S 166 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, for grant of compensation of Rs.40,00,000/-, on account of death of Sumran Kumar, aged 20 years, occupation, rickshaw puller, in a motor vehicular accident, which was taken place on intervening night of 29/30.10.2015 at about 02.30 A.M, and FIR No. 274 dated 30.10.2015 under sections 279, 304-A IPC was registered in Police Station Parao against the respondent No.1. 2The necessary facts leading to accident are that on 29/30.10.2015 Sumran Kumar (since deceased) was standing along with his rickshaw for waiting the passengers near Durbin chowk on Chandigarh-Delhi Road, Ambala Cantt and at about 2.30 AM, a Haryana Roadways Bus Nuh Depot, bearing registration No. HR-74-A-8802 was coming from Delhi side in a very high speed, in a zigzag, rash and negligent manner, without observing traffic rules and by coming on extreme left side berm{kacha} portion of the road and hit his bus into the rickshaw and due to this impact, rickshaw puller fell down on the road and then tyre of the bus run over his head, as a consequence, he died at the spot on account of injuries suffered to him. At the time of accident, Kuldeep Singh and Sushil Kumar were present and they are witnesses of scene of accident. The deceased Sumran Kumar was taken to Civil Hospital Ambala Cantt where he was declared as brought dead. PARO DEVI ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 3 Postmortem was also conducted. This accident took place entirely due to rash and negligent driving of Bus bearing registration No. HR-74-A-8802 by respondent No.1 Second aspect of this claim petition is that the claimant No.1 is mother, claimant No.2 is minor brother and claimants No.3 and 4 are minor sisters of the deceased. Prior to death, deceased was enjoying very good health and physique and he was working as rickshaw puller and used to earn Rs.15,000/- per month. Since father of deceased had already expired and no other family member was earning except deceased, therefore, all claimants were fully dependent upon his income and thus they are entitled to compensation to the tune of Rs.40 lacs alongwith interest @ 18% per annum. At the relevant time, respondent No.2 was owner of offending bus in question, which was insured with respondent No.3 and as such respondents are equally, jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the claimants. Hence, this petition. 3Respondent No.1 filed written statement with the stand that the bus in question was owned by respondent No.2 and insured with respondent No.3. No accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. The amount of compensation as claimed is highly exaggerated, however, answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation and prayed for dismissal the same. 4Respondent No.2 filed written statement interalia on the preliminary objections that the accident in question has been occurred due to sole negligence on the part of the deceased i.e rickshaw puller; that bus PARO DEVI ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 4 in question is insured with New India Assurance Company Ltd; that the driver of the bus had a valid and effective driving licence, route permit and fitness certificate etc at the time of accident. On merit, it is submitted that respondent No.1 Krishan Lal driver was on duty with the bus No. HR-74-A-8802 on 29/30.10.2015 the bus was going Delhi-Chandigarh- Shimla; that the driver of the bus was driving the bus in a slow and moderate speed and in its correct left side; that rickshaw puller was coming from a wrong side and suddenly the rickshaw puller was unbalanced and struck towards conductor side; that the accident took place due to the negligence of rickshaw puller; that there is no fault of the driver of the bus and prayed for dismissal the petition with costs. In the alternate, if this Tribunal comes to an adverse order, in that contingency, the liability to pay compensation would be of the said Insurance company. 5Respondent No.3 filed written statement by taking preliminary objection that bus bearing registration No. HR-74-A-8802 was being driven b respondent No.1 without valid and effective driving licence; registration certificate, route permit and fitness certificate at the time of alleged accident, in violation of terms and conditions of insurance police and thus answering respondent is not liable at all; that the answering respondent takes up all the pleas and defences available to him under sections 147/149/169 and 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act; that the answering respondent reserves its right to file the amended written statement; that the claim petition is bad for not impleading all the legal heirs as a party to the petition. On merit, it is submitted that no document PARO DEVI ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 5 has been placed on record to prove the income and occupation of the deceased. The deceased was much elder in the age as alleged in the claim petition. No accident took place with the bus bearing registration No. HR- 74-A-8802, as alleged in the petition. FIR, if any, against the respondent No.1 is false and lodged with the police in connivance with the claimants. It is further submitted that bus in question was not insured with the answering respondent at the time of alleged accident. However, Chasis No./ Engine No. MB1PBEYC6EADE2565/DEHZ 418167 was owned by the respondent No.2. All the averments made in relief para are wrong, baseless and only to get compensation from the answering respondent and prayed for dismissal the same with costs. 6Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following issues are framed vide order dated 13.05.2016:- 1Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1 while driving Bus bearing Registration No.HR-74-A-8802 resulting into causing death of Sumran Kumar, as alleged? OPP. 2If Issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom, the claimants are entitled to? OPP. 3Whether petition is not maintainable in the present form? OPR. 4Whether the petition is bad for not impleading all the legal heirs as a party to the petition ?OPR 5Whether respondent no.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect? OPR. 6Whether respondent no.3 is entitled to take all the defences available to it under the M.V . Act ? OPR. PARO DEVI ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 6 7Relief. 7 To establish their claim through this enquiry, petitioners examined the following testimonies:- PW1 Paro Devi @ Parwati ( mother of deceased) tendered her affidavit Ex.PW1/A reiterating the facts mentioned in the petition. In cross-examination, she answered that she is resident of Village Sir Mata, District Purnia Bihar. Her Ration Card, V oter Card are of Bihar. She never resided in Ambala Cantt. Her marriage was solemnized 20-30 years ago. She got married at the age of 15-20 years. Name of her husband was Thakur Chaudhary who was about five years elder to him. Out of this wedlock five children were born and now there are only three children and two have been expired. She is doing labour work at Ambala. She is getting Rs.230/- per day. She is doing the labour work for the last two years. She is not having any documentary proof to show that Sumran was her son. Her husband had expired two years ago. The whole family is dependent upon her for the last 2-3 years. She does not know that Sumran was plying rickshaw whether it was on rent or owned. Again said it was owned by him. He purchased it about year back before his death but she is not aware from whom and for what amount same was purchased. Accident did not take place in her presence since she was not present. She does not know about the contents of affidavit Ex.PW1/A. She does not have any proof of income of Sumran Kumar. It is correct that if Sumran would have alive, then she would have got him married 6 months later. It is denied that Sumran Kumar was not her son or that he was not PARO DEVI ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 7 plying a rickshaw and was not earning anything. It is denied that Sumran Kumar was dependent upon her income. It is denied that she had not spent Rs. one lac on last rites of her son. It is wrong to suggest that her age is more then 60 years. PW2 Kuldeep Singh (author of FIR) tendered his affidavit Ex.PW2/A along with FIR Ex.P2 supporting the version of PW1 regarding the accident. In cross-examination, he answered that he is VIIIth class pass. He can read Hindi little bit and no other language. He does not know the contents of Exx.PW2/A only his signatures have been obtained at the instance of Advocate. V olunteered, the contents were read over to him by his Advocate. He does not know whether the said affidavit has been attested. Police official had told him the name of the driver as Krishan Lal, respondent No.1. He was standing under the flyover of Ambala Cantt in front of Railway Station; One one Sushil Kumar auto- driver and few rickshaw people were standing at some distance. It is correct that if a bus is coming from Delhi and going to Chandigarh and has to go to bus stand it firstly has to go via deluxe Dhaba for entering to bus stand. It is also correct that there is cemented divider in between which leads to bus stand via Deluxe Dhaba. He cannot tell the distance where he was standing which leads to bus stand via Deluxe Dhaba. He lodged the FIR. He cannot tell whether he had mentioned in the FIR that he was standing under flyover at the time of accident. Sumran Kumar was sitting in rickshaw 20-25 yards away from him. There is no shop near the place of accident where the deceased was sitting on rickshaw. It is PARO DEVI ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 8 correct that all the vehicles which go into the bus stand because of turning they all used to very slowly. He had given evidence in one case of his brother who had expired in road side accident. He did not inform the police but Sushil Kumar informed police at about 2-2.30 AM. His statement was recorded by the police at the bus stand on the same day. He was not taken the injured to hospital. Police ambulance took the injured to hospital. Thereafter, learned counsel for claimants tendered documents i.e attested copy of ration card Ex.P3; attested cop of Aadhar card of sumran Kumar as Ex.P4; Attested copy of voter card of Thakur Chaudhary as Ex.P5; attested copy of Aadhar card of Paro Devi Ex.P6; attested copy of voter ID of Paro Devi as Ex.P7 and attested copy of Crime detail form as Ex.P8 and closed the claimants evidence. On the other hand, respondents did not examine any witness, rather, learned counsel for respondent No.1 tendered copy of DL of respondent No.1 as Ex.R2 and closed the evidence. Further counsel for respondent No.3 tendered copy of insurance policy as Ex.R1 and closed his evidence and rest of evidence has been closed by Order of this Tribunal after providing ample opportunities to respondents No.2 and 3. No rebuttal evidence was led and learned counsel for claimants closed the rebuttal evidence . 8I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on various issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1: 9 Onus to prove this issue is upon the claimants. Under this issue, PARO DEVI ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 9 claimants are required to establish fact that accident took place due to sole rash and negligent driving of vehicle i.e bus bearing registration No. HR- 74-A-8802 by Respondent no.1, resulting into death of Sumran Kumar. It is argued by counsel for claimants that PW2 Kuldeep Kumar is witness of scene of accident, who while appearing in the witness box has supported the version mentioned in the claim petition relating to accident. It is admitted fact that respondent No.1 has been facing trial under sections 279, 304-A of IPC. It is further argued that respondent No.1 did not appear to rebut the version of PW2 and so it is proved on record that accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of bus bearing registration No. HR-74-A-8802 by respondent No.1 and prayed for deciding this issue in favour of claimants. 10On the other hand, it is argued by learned counsel for respondent No.1, that no accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the bus, rather, accident was occurred due to fault of rickshaw puller. It is argued by counsel for respondent No.3 that presence of PW2 at the time of accident is doubtful and so his testimony cannot be believed and prayed for deciding this issue against the claimants. 11 I have considered rival contentions put forth by learned counsel for respective parties and have perused the entire evidence meticulously. After through examination, it is observed that claimants have come to this Tribunal with categorical stand that accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of bus bearing registration No. HR-74- A-8802 by respondent No.1, as a consequence, Sumran Kumar PARO DEVI ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 10 succumbed to his injuries at the spot. The contents mentioned in the petition are corroborated with oral as well as documentary evidence. So far as oral evidence is concerned, PW2 is author of FIR, who categorically stated in his affidavit Ex.PW2/A that on 29/30.10.2015 he alongwith his friend Sushil was present at Durbin Chowk Ambala Cantt. At about 2.30 AM, a Haryana Roadways bus bearing registration No. HR-74-A-8802 being driven by respondent No.1 Kishan Lal came from Delhi side in a very high speed, rash and negligent manner and without observing traffic rules by coming on its wrong side and hit the rickshaw of deceased which was parked in a side of the road due to which the deceased rickshaw puller fell down on the road and the tyre of the bus run over the deceased Sumran Kumar. The deceased received simple, multiple grievous including head injuries and died on the spot due to the injuries suffered by him. The entire accident was witnessed by him. This witness was cross- examined at length, but nothing fruitful could be elicited, which may disbelieve the factum of accident resulting death of Rickshaw puller. It is unquestioned that respondent No.1 did not appear in the witness box to rebut the version of PW2. So, statement of PW2 corroborated by FIR Ex.P2 and PMR Ex.P3 are found sufficient to say that respondent No.1 was sole liable for causing this accident due to his rash and negligent driving of bus in question resulting death of Sumran Kumar at the day of accident. It is quite well settled preposition of law that Each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The Tribunal is expected to adjudge a case on the basis of the evidence adduced without giving too PARO DEVI ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 11 much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled position of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. It must be remembered that in a motor accident claim, the claimants are not required to prove their case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. It is trite law that claimants-petitioners are required to prove its case, which sets up the particular fact relating to the accident, which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts upon the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way as alleged by the claimants. Here, respondent no.1 did not come in the witness box to rebut the version of PW2. The provisions with regard to claim under the Act are enacted keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimants are always entitled for compensation. The evidence proved on record irrefutably leads to the inference that offending vehicle was involved in the motor vehicular accident due to rash and negligent driving by respondent No.1, resulting death of unmarried young boy and FIR was also registered against respondent No.1 who is facing trial. In view of case law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993 (2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008 (2) R.C.R. (Civil) 774 , it can be safely said that respondent No.1 was liable for causing the motor vehicular accident due to his rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Accordingly, this issue no.1 is decided in favour of the claimants. PARO DEVI ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 12 ISSUE NO. 2: 12 The onus to prove this issue is upon claimants. Under this issue, claimants are required to establish that as to what amount of compensation is to be assessed according to income of deceased. According to evidence available on record, it can be gathered that deceased was unmarried at the time of accident. His date of birth as shown in Aadhar Card Ex.P4 is 18.02.1995 and this accident took place on 29/30.10.2015 and as such age of deceased at the time of his death was about 20 years 8 months. Further, age of his mother i.e claimant No.1 has been shown in her Aadhar card is 1.1.1973 and if it is counted, then it comes to 42 years at the day of accident. Father of deceased Sumran was already expired. It is the case of claimants that so claimant No.1 and deceased were only source of income to look after and manage the affairs of minor claimants No.2 to 4. Although age of claimants No.2 to 4 have been shown below 16 years, but no documentary proof regarding their exact age has been adduced on record. It has also brought in evidence of PW1 that she is earning Rs.230/- per day from doing the labour work and she lives in a state of Bihar. She has own residential house in District Purnia State of Bihar. Coming to income of deceased, although, it has been pleaded in the petition that deceased was earning monthly income of Rs.15,000/- from work of rickshaw pulling, but no such documentary proof showing monthly income of Rs.15,000/- is proved on file and so his monthly being labourer can be assessed by guess work. If he was earning PARO DEVI ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 13 250 per day even then his monthly income of deceased in the year 2015 cannot be assessed more than Rs.7500/-. Since deceased was bachelor and elder male member in his family and he was having responsibility of three minor brothers and sister with mother, therefore, his personal living expenses is restricted to the extent of 1/3 only. It is proved that age of mother at the time of death was 42 years and so multiplier of 14 according to age of mother would be applied. PW1 also stated that claimants have spent sufficient amount on funeral/ last rites of deceased son. The claimants have also deprived love and affection. It may not be out of place to mention here that the monetary compensation will never be a sufficient succor for victims of accidental cases, rather their needs can only be prevented by providing just compensation. The best manner in which victims can be compensated for sufferings only to prevent recurrence of any such road incident. In failure to protect or prevent the sufferings of victims due to death of their bread earner in road accident, it also imposes liability of state to take extra ordinary precaution to reduce such type of road accident by deputing sufficient trained traffic police for compliance of strict traffic rules to avoid such incident. It will certainly take lot of time for rehabilitation by the family members of deceased. 13 In view of Smt. Sarla Verma and Ors. Vs Delhi Transport Corporation and another AIR 2009 Supreme Court 3104 and by applying multiplier of 14 as per age of deceased mother, assessment of PARO DEVI ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 14 compensation would come to {60,000x14} Rs. 8,40,000/-. Additionally, petitioners have deprived from love and affection and also suffered pain, agony. Loss of future prospects due to untimely death, therefore, claimants are entitled to Rs one lakh- in that head. PW1 had also spent amount on last rites/funeral of deceased and so she is entitled to funeral expenses amounting Rs.25,000/- and in this manner, total compensation is computed to Rs.9,65,000/- which shall be payable to the claimants along with interest @ 7.5/- per annum from the date of filing the petition till its realization. Accordingly, issue no.2 is decided in favour of claimants- petitioners. Rests of relief sought by petitioners-claimants stands declined. ISSUE No.3, 4 & 6 : 14The onus to prove these issues are upon Respondents, but they neither pressed these issue nor led any evidence. Further, it has already discussed in detail under Issue No.1 & 2 that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. In this way, it has become obvious on file that this tribunal has left with no other option except to decide these issues against Respondents. Accordingly, all these issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.5 : 15 The onus to prove this issue is upon the respondent No.3, who is under the obligation to prove this fact that the respondent No.1 was not having a valid driving licence at the time of alleged accident and as such PARO DEVI ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 15 respondent no.2 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy/cover note EX.R1 and so, respondent No.3 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimants. However, there is nothing on record to show that respondent No.1 was not holding any valid license, rather same is proved as EX.R2. Further, Insurance Policy Ex.R1 reveals that offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.3, at the relevant time. There is nothing brought on record to show that the Driving Licence Ex.R2 was invalid at the day of occurrence. In the fact and circumstances, it is quite clear that the respondent no.2, did not violate or breach any covenant of the insurance policy. Accordingly, this Issue is decided against respondent No.3. ISSUE NO.7 (RELIEF): PETITION SUCCEEDS ; 16 In view of the foregoing discussion, instant claim petition stands allowed with costs in a manner that the claimants-petitioners are held entitled to compensation of Rs.9,65,000/- along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of this claim petition till the date of actual payment. The awarded compensation amount along with interest shall be payable jointly and severally by all respondents and respondent no.3, shall indemnify the insured. However, 50 percent compensation amount shall be deposited in any nationalized bank in the shape of FDR in the name of all three minor which shall be payable at the time of attaining their majority as per their equal share. However, balance 50 percent along with additional compensation amount shall be paid to claimant no.1 in her bank account as per rules. Remaining relief sought by claimants stands declined. Counsel fee PARO DEVI ETC VS KRISHAN LAL ETC 16 is assessed as Rs.3000/-. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly and file be consigned to records after due compliance. Announced in open Court.

The stand of the respondents in these claim petitions is same regarding the accident and liability as taken by them in claim petition no.324 of 2015 titled as Harpreet Singh versus Satpal Singh and another . 8.All above mentioned three claim petitions were consolidated vide Order dated 13.5.2016 and from pleadings of parties, following issues were framed: 1.Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 while driving Car bearing registration no.HR54/8524 resulting into damage to motorcycle bearing no.HR54A/6181, injuries to Paramjeet Kaur and Harpreet Singh, as alleged? OPP 2.If issue no.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom, claimants are entitled? OPP 3.Whether respondent no.1 was driving the offending Car in violation of terms and conditions of Insurance Policy? OPR (2) 4.Relief 9.In order to prove their case, petitioner Paramjeet Kaur herself stepped as PW1, whereas claimant Harpreet Singh stepped as PW2. In documentary evidence, documents Ex.P1 to Ex.P58 were tendered. 10.On the other hand, only documents Ex.R1 to Ex.R3 were tendered on behalf of respondent no.1, whereas respondent no.2 led no oral or documentary evidence. 11.No rebuttal evidence was led. HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 9 12.I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the material pleadings, evidence and the legal proposition applicable to the present case. My findings on the above issues are as under:- Issue No.1: 13.To prove this issue, learned counsel for the petitioners took me to the testimony of PW1 Paramjeet Kaur and PW2 Harpreet Singh and contended that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving Car no.HR54/8524 in rash and negligent manner. 14.PW2 Harpreet Singh filed his affidavit Ex.PW2/A and specifically deposed that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 as he was driving Car no.HR54/8524 in rash and negligent manner at that time. He specifically deposed about the manner of accident and the rash and negligent driving on part of respondent no.1. PW1 Paramjeet Kaur corroborated the version of PW2 on the point of rash and negligent driving by respondent no.1 and the manner in which the accident was caused. PW1 and PW2 were cross examined at length, but there is nothing on record on the basis of which their statements can be disbelieved. 15.In regard to the accident, FIR no.131 dated 22.6.2015, P.S. Mullana, District Ambala (Ex.P48) was registered on the statement of PW2 Harpreet Singh. After investigation of case, final report under Section 173 Cr.P.C Ex.P57 was filed and respondent no.1 is facing trial. The respondent no.1 was the best witness, but for reasons best known to him, he failed to appear as witness to controvert the allegations levelled HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 10 against him that he was driving the offending vehicle bearing registration no.HR54/8524 in rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. In a situation, when respondent no.1-driver is facing criminal trial for having caused accident, it is safe to presume that it was due to his negligence that the accident had occurred. 16.Considering the above facts, this tribunal is of the view that the petitioners have successfully proved that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving offending vehicle bearing registration no.HR54/8524 in rash and negligent manner. Hence, this issue is decided in favour of petitioners. Issue no.2 & 3: MACP No.324 of 2015 Harpreet Singh vs. Satpal Singh & another 17.This claim petition has been filed by petitioner claiming compensation of Rs.50,000/- on account of damage to his vehicle i.e. motor-cycle bearing registration no.HR54A/6181. Claimant appeared as PW2 and specifically deposed in his affidavit Ex.PW2/A that his motor- cycle bearing registration no.HR54A/6181, Make Splendor, Model 2012 was badly damaged. In his affidavit, he has not deposed about the amount spent on repair of his motor-cycle. In his cross-examination, he deposed that period of insurance policy of his motor-cycle expired about twenty days prior to this accident and his motor-cycle was not insured. He further deposed that he did not know if repair work of the engine was also done or not or whether engine HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 11 of his motor-cycle was damaged or not. 18.In order to support his claim, petitioner placed on record repair bills of motor-cycle Ex.P49 to Ex.P51, which shows that he spent Rs.29,186/-. As per Insurance Policy of motor-cycle Ex.R1, total value of the motor-cycle has been assessed as Rs.26,700/- for the purpose of calculating the premium. Even if it is taken that motor-cycle was totally damaged, even then he would have claimed Rs.26,700/-. On perusal of bills Ex.P49 to Ex.P51, it is clear that he had got changed some parts of the motor-cycle, which would not been damaged in the accident. It shows that he got changed all parts, which were not in working condition, presuming that Insurance Company will pay against the same. The claimant has not examined any Mechanical Expert or any person from Rekhi Motors, otherwise all things would have been cleared during cross- examination. Nothing is mentioned in bills Ex.P49 to Ex.P51 qua disposal of changed damaged parts of the vehicle nor value of such parts has not been deducted. He has simply placed on record the bills Ex.P49 to Ex.P51. 19.Considering the facts and insured value of the vehicle, this Tribunal is of the view that petitioner is not entitled to get whole of the amount shown in the bills Ex.P49 to Ex.P51. This Tribunal is of the view that petitioner is only entitled to Rs.20,000/- for damage of the vehicle. Accordingly, Rs.20,000/- is awarded to petitioner under the head of damage to vehicle. HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 12 MACP No. 325 of 2015 Paramjeet Kaur vs. Satpal Singh & another 20.The petitioner sustained injuries in the accident in question and she claimed compensation of Rs.5 lakh on account of injuries sustained by her and amount spent by her on her treatment etc. The petitioner appeared as PW1 and deposed that after the accident, she was shifted to MM Hospital, Mullana, where she remained hospitalized for around fifteen days, during which she was operated upon. She deposed that she spent more than Rs.One lakh on her treatment, transportation, medicines, special diet and attendant etc. She further deposed that she was working as Warden in GNI, Mullana and was earning Rs.10,000/- per month. In her cross-examination, she deposed that she had not brought any document to prove her employment or about any loss of income. 21.In order to support her version regarding amount spent by her on treatment, she placed on record her medical bills Ex.P1 to Ex.P29 and Admission Form Ex.P31. On perusal of Admission Form, it is clear that she remained admitted for twelve days (21.6.2015 to 2.7.2015) in MM Institute of Medical Science, Mullana. Considering the fact that petitioner remained hospitalized for twelve days and suffered pain and suffering, this Tribunal is of the view that petitioner is entitled to Rs.12,000/- under the head of pain and suffering. Accordingly, Rs.12,000/- is awarded to petitioner under the head of pain and suffering. HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 13 22.On perusal of medical bills Ex.P1 to Ex.P29, it is clear that petitioner spent Rs.11,597/- on her treatment. Accordingly, Rs.11,600/- is awarded to petitioner under the head of medical bills and treatment charges. 23.Compensation has also been claimed under the head permanent disability. As per Disability Certificate Ex.P30, disability of 5% has been assessed due to mild back ache. It is also clear that the disability is provisional and not permanent. Accordingly, it is held that petitioner is not entitled to any compensation under the head of permanent disability. 24.Now coming to loss of income. Petitioner remained hospitalized and under treatment. As per Certificate Ex.P52, issued by Guru Nanak Institute of Technology, petitioner was working as Care Taker in Girls' Hostel and was drawing salary of Rs.8000/- per month. She remained on leave for one month and the leave for said period was without pay. So, she is entitled to get Rs.8000/- under the head of loss of income and accordingly, Rs.8000/- is awarded to claimant under the head of loss of income. 25.In addition to the amount awarded above, Rs.3000/- is awarded under the head of special diet and Rs.2000/- under the head of transportation. In total, Rs.36,600/- is awarded in favour of the petitioner on account of the injuries suffered by the petitioner in the accident. HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 14 MACP No. 326 of 2015 Harpreet Singh vs. Satpal Singh & another 26.The petitioner sustained injuries in the accident in question and he claimed compensation of Rs.5 lakh on account of injuries sustained by him and amount spent by him on his treatment etc. The petitioner appeared as PW2 and deposed that after the accident, he was shifted to MM Hospital, Mullana, where he remained hospitalized for around ten days, during which he was operated upon. He deposed that he spent more than Rs.One lakh on his treatment, transportation, medicines, special diet and attendant etc. He further deposed that he was getting training in T.B. Hospital, Ambala and was earning Rs.10,000/- per month. 27.In order to support his version regarding amount spent by him on treatment, he placed on record his medical bills Ex.P32 to Ex.P46 and Admission Form Ex.P47. On perusal of Admission Form, it is clear that he remained admitted for five days (21.6.2015 to 25.6.2015) in MM Institute of Medical Science, Mullana. Considering the fact that petitioner remained hospitalized for five days and suffered pain and suffering, this Tribunal is of the view that petitioner is entitled to Rs.5000/- under the head of pain and suffering. Accordingly, Rs.5000/- is awarded to petitioner under the head of pain and suffering. 28.On perusal of medical bills Ex.P32 to Ex.P46, it is clear that petitioner spent Rs.9500/- on his treatment. Accordingly, Rs.8478/- is awarded to petitioner under the head of medical bills and treatment charges. HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 15 29.Compensation has also been claimed under the head permanent disability. He has not placed on record any document in support of any disability.

In total, Rs.23,478/- is awarded in favour of petitioner on account of injuries suffered by petitioner in the accident. 31.Now coming to the question of liability to pay compensation. No evidence has been led by Insurance Company to prove issue no.3. Accordingly, issue no.3 is decided against respondent no.2. Admittedly, vehicle in question was insured with respondent no.2. Accordingly, respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to petitioners. Relief: 32.In view of the above discussion and findings on issues, above mentioned three claim petitions are partly allowed with cost.

Mohinder Bindal, counsel for respondent no.3. Respondent no.1 exparte. J U D G E M E N T: This claim petition under Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act Jagjit Singh, MACT MayaDevi&Anr. Vs. RamGopaletc. 2 for grant of compensation to the tune of Rs. 25,00,000/- on account of death of Shubham son of Somnath in a Motor vehicle accident has been filed by the petitioners. 2)Brief facts of the claim petition are that on 01.05.2015 the deceased Shubham alongwith his brother Shunty was going towards Subzi Mandi, Ambala Cantt on the motorcycle bearing registration No.HR-01W- 3792 and the motorcycle was being driven by Shunty and the deceased was pillion rider on the motorcycle. At about 8:00 A.M. after crossing the Swastika Chowk when they reached behind the Savoy Hotel on Jagadhri Road, in the meantime a Canter bearing registration No.HR-45A-5974 came from behind being driven by respondent no.1 in a rash and negligent manner and hit the motorcycle. Due to the accident both the motorcyclists fell down on the road and the rear tyre of the canter run away from the head of the deceased as a result of which the deceased died at the spot. Matter was reported to the police and FIR was got registered against the respondent no.1. Lastly, it was prayed that compensation amount to the tune of Rs. 25,00,000/- be awarded to them on account of death of deceased Shubham son of Somnath along with interest @ 18% per annum, from the date of filing of the petition till its realization, for which respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation. 3)The respondents No.1 and 2 being driver and owner of the Jagjit Singh, MACT MayaDevi&Anr. Vs. RamGopaletc. 3 offending canter filed joint written statement and denied the averments made in the petition and stated that no accident took place due to negligent act of respondent no.1, however, a false and frivolous FIR was registered against the respondent no.1 just to fetch the claim. All other material averments were denied and lastly prayed for dismissal of the petition. 4)Respondent No.3 Insurance Company contested the petition by filing separate joint written statement and it was submitted that driver of the offending vehicle/respondent No.1 was not having valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident and insured willfully violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. The factum of accident as alleged by the claimants in the petition was denied and submitted that a false FIR has been registered against respondent No.1 in collusion with the police. Remaining contents of the petition were denied and prayer to dismiss the petition was made. 5)Replication was not filed. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed :- 1.Whether the accident in question causing death of Shubham took place due to rash and negligent driving of Canter bearing registration No.HR-45A-5974 by respondent no.1, as alleged? OPP. 2.If issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation the petitioners are entitled to and from whom? OPP. Jagjit Singh, MACT MayaDevi&Anr. Vs. RamGopaletc. 4 3.Whether the Insurance Company is not liable to pay any compensation, in view of the preliminary objections raised in its written statement and whether there has been a breach of terms and conditions of the policy of insurance? OPR-2 4.Relief. 6) In support of their case, claimant no.1 herself appeared in the witness box as PW-1 and also examined Shunty as PW-2, Amit Kharbanda as PW-3. Besides oral evidence, the following documents were placed on record:- Ex.P-1 :FIR Ex.P-2 :Post Mortem Report Thereafter, ld. Counsel for the petitioners closed the evidence. 7)On the other hand, the respondents have examined Gurbir Singh as RW-1 and Naresh Kumar as RW-2. Besides oral evidence, the following documents were placed on record:- Ex.R-1 :D.L. Ex.R-2 :R.C. Ex.R-3 :D.L. Ex.R-4 :Verification Report Ex.R-5 :Insurance Policy Ex.R-A :Insurance Policy Jagjit Singh, MACT MayaDevi&Anr. Vs. RamGopaletc. 5 8)No evidence in rebuttal was led by the petitioner. 9)I have heard learned counsel for the parties and gone through the material placed on record. My issue-wise finding are given as under:- ISSUE No.1:- 10)The onus of proving this issue was on the petitioners and to prove the same, learned counsel for the petitioners argued that in the present case on 01.05.2015 the deceased Shubham alongwith his brother Shunty was going on their motorcycle No.HR-01W-3792 driven by Shunty and when they reached near Savoy Hotel, one canter driven by respondent no.1 came from behind and hit into their motorcycle and ran over Shubham, who died at the spot. The FIR in the present case was got registered by Shunty on the same day. It has also been deposed by him in the witness box. The FIR, Ex.P-1 also mentions the manner in which the accident was caused and the respondent no.1 disclosed his name to the complainant at the spot. It was argued that no rebuttal to this has come on the part of the respondents and as such it is clearly proved about the accident in question having been caused by the rash and negligent driving of his canter by the respondent no.1, who was otherwise facing the trial as deposed by PW-3. 11)Learned counsel for the respondents meanwhile argued that no such accident was ever caused by the respondent no.1 and a false claim petition has been filed in the present case. Jagjit Singh, MACT MayaDevi&Anr. Vs. RamGopaletc. 6 12)I have heard the counsels for the parties and perused the file carefully. 13)FIR Ex.P-1, mentions the manner in which the accident was caused and which was got registered on the same day and also mentions the name of respondent no.1 as the offending driver and number of the canter being driven by him. The respondent no.1 was facing trial for the said offence as deposed by PW-3 and no rebuttal to this came on the part of the respondents. Even otherwise, it is observed by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Smt. Surinder Kaur and others Versus Lakhbir Singh and another 2007(1) PLR 494 that; “F.I.R.-Being a public document is admissible in evidence as such and if no objection is raised at the time of production thereof, the same is to be read in evidence.” Similar view was held by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Bansi Yadav and another Versus Krishan Kumar and another 2004(3) ACC 758. Keeping in view the principle laid down in authorities (Supra), it becomes clear that the FIR being a public document and when not rebutted is to be considered as true. It is also important to note that the proceedings in MACT cases are of summary nature and the case is not to be proved like civil case where case is to be proved from the point of Jagjit Singh, MACT MayaDevi&Anr. Vs. RamGopaletc. 7 preponderance of probabilities or in criminal case, where charge is to be proved beyond shadows of doubt. The FIR has been registered against the respondent no.1. So, in view of law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993(2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008(2) R.C.R. (civil) 774, it can be safely held that the accident in question took place due to negligence of Canter bearing registration No.HR-54A-5974 by respondent no.1. Accordingly, issue no.1 is decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUES No.2 AND 4:- 14)The onus of proving issue no.2 was on the petitioners while onus of proving issue no.4 was upon the respondents. Finding of one issue shall have bearing on the other and hence the same are being decided together. To prove the above issues, learned counsel for the petitioners argued that the deceased was student of 9th class and 15 years old at the time of his death and he had a bright future and the petitioners, who are his parents are accordingly entitled to the compensation. 15)Learned counsel for the respondents argued that the father of the deceased cannot be said to be dependent of the deceased and only the mother can claim compensation. 16)I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the case file carefully. Jagjit Singh, MACT MayaDevi&Anr. Vs. RamGopaletc. 8 17)The deceased is claimed to be a student in the present case and no rebuttal to this contention of the petitioners has come on file. As per his Post Mortem Report the deceased was about 15 years old at the time of his death but his father – petitioner no.2 cannot be said to be dependent upon the deceased and therefore, only the petitioner no.1 would become entitled to the compensation in the present case. With regard to compensation to which the petitioner no.1 is entitled to, it is seen that the deceased was a child of 15 years and only a student and not earning anything. The Hon'ble Supreme Court has held in Kishan Gopal & Another Vs. Lala & Others, 2013(3) RCR 276 , with regard to the death of a child of 10 years where notional income of Rs.3000/- per month was taken and the multiplier was applied according to the age of the parents of the deceased + sum of Rs.50,000/- was granted under conventional head and similar are the facts of the present case and therefore, notional income of the deceased is taken as Rs.3000/- per month and the age of the mother of the deceased was 40 years and therefore, the multiplier that would apply in the present case is that of '15' and by applying the same, the amount comes to Rs.4,50,000/- and alongwith this a sum of Rs.50,000/- under the conventional heads is also granted to the petitioner no.1. Thus, the total compensation of Rs.5,00,000/-. The petitioner no.1 would also become entitled to interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of Jagjit Singh, MACT MayaDevi&Anr. Vs. RamGopaletc. 9 petition till actual realization. 18)With regard to respondents liable to pay the amount of compensation, it was argued by the learned counsel for respondent no.3 that the policy as produced by the respondent no.2 is fake policy and was never issued by their office, for which a witness has also been examined. Whereas it was argued by the ld. Counsel for the respondent no.2 that a valid policy was issued to them by the agent of the company of respondent no.3 and they had no occasion to get it verified from any person and cannot be held liable in any manner. That otherwise the respondent no.1 holds a valid DL Ex.R-1 and the vehicle is properly registered vide registration certificate Ex.R-2 and it is respondent no.3, who is liable to pay the compensation in the present case. 19)I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have perused the file carefully. 20)The policy on which the respondents no.1 and 2 claimed that their vehicle was insured is Ex.R-5 and respondent no.3 has examined his witnesses RW-1 and RW-2, wherein it has been deposed by RW-1 that the license issued to the respondent no.1 was for motorcycle, non-transport LMV and not for any heavy transport vehicle and the driver could not drive any medium or heavy category vehicle and RW-2 has deposed that the policy on which the respondent no.2 relies was never issued by their company and rather the policy against this number has been issued to Jagjit Singh, MACT MayaDevi&Anr. Vs. RamGopaletc. 10 another vehicle and the present policy was fake. 21)Perusal of this evidence and documents on file show that as per the testimony of these witnesses of respondent no.3 the number of the policy mentioned on the policy put forward by respondent no.2, a policy has been issued for two-wheeler to one Ms. Pooja Mantry, which is Ex.RA and the DL Ex.R-1 does not entitle the respondent no.1 to drive any medium or heavy category vehicle. As a result, on both these counts the respondents no.1 and 2 violated the terms and conditions of the policy and it cannot be said that the vehicle driven by respondent no.1 was insured with the respondent no.3 and therefore, they do not become entitled to pay any amount of compensation in the present case and it is only respondents no.1 and 2, who are liable to pay the amount of compensation to the petitioner no.1. Accordingly, issue no.2 is decided in favour of the petitioners and issue no.4 is decided in favour of the respondent no.3. ISSUE NO.3: 22)No evidence in this regard has been led by the respondent no.2 as to why the petition is not maintainable and accordingly this issue stands decided against the respondent no.2. ISSUE NO. 4 (RELIEF):- 23)Keeping in view of my detailed discussion on all the Jagjit Singh, MACT MayaDevi&Anr. Vs. RamGopaletc. 11 aforesaid issues, the petition is allowed with costs. The petitioner no.1 is entitled to the amount of Rs.5,00,000/- as compensation. The petitioner no.1 is also entitled for the interest of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization. Amount of award be given to the petitioner no.1 by way of cash. The respondents No.1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly and file be consigned to record room after due compliance.

When they reached the turn of Village Lotton, then a Swift Car bearing No. CH-04-H-4936 being driven by respondent No.1 in a very rash and negligent manner, came from village Matheri side and struck his car into motorcycle and the impact was so high as a consequence, claimant and Pritpal Singh firstly fell on the car and then on the road. The claimant received several multiple and grievous injuries, including two fractures on his left thigh, right thigh one fracture, on fracture on buttock, left hand fracture, right hand wrist fracture, right arm injury and injuries on other parts of his body. There were gathered public persons. Claimant and Pritpal Singh noted down the number of the car. Ambulance came at the spot. Both were taken to PHC Chaurmastpur and then referred to Civil Hospital Ambala City. The condition of claimant was serious, so they were referred to PGI Chandigarh, where they both were treated. The claimant remained unconscious for several days and could not give any statement. When he regained conscious, then he and Pritpal Singh described about the accident to Baljeet Singh (father of claimant} and one Satwant Singh. The respondents No.1 and 2 requested the claimant and his father for SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 3 compromise and Baljeet Singh was busy in the treatment of the claimant and the claimant and his family members were under the impression that the police has taken action against the respondent No.1, but they came to know that the police has not registered the criminal case against the respondent No.1, then they gave the statement for registration of FIR on 31.10.2014. Second aspect of this claim petition is that claimant was hale and hearty prior to accident but due to the said accident he is still on bed. He and his family members have suffered lot of pain and agony. He has become totally disabled and is unable to do the any job and is unable to do any personal work. He is feeling giddiness due to the said accident. He was the beard-earner of his family and has high hopes in future, which have been shattered. The claimant was employee in Steel Strip Company Lalru but due to the disability caused in his body on account of injuries, he became unable to do any work and cannot even walk without any help. The claimant was also helping his father in cultivating the fields. He remained admitted in PGI for several days and his various operations were conducted. He is still treatment. He has spent more than Rs.2.5 lacs on his treatment, special diet, transportation etc and the family members of the claimant has been looking after him. This accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of car bearing Registration No. CH-04- H-4936 by respondent no.1 and is insured with respondent no.2, and so, both respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to claimant. SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 4 3Upon notice, respondents no.1 and 2 filed written statement separately. Respondent no.1 took preliminary objection regarding maintainability and that present claim petition has been filed by the claimant just to claim the amount against the answering respondent. In fact no accident as alleged was ever occurred with the car bearing Registration No.CH-04-H-4936. On merit, it is submitted that no accident ever took place due to rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1 as alleged. The vehicle of the answering respondent was falsely implicated. However, a false FIR was lodged against him. The car bearing Registration No.CH-04-H-4936 is insured with the respondent No.2 and respondent No.1 was having an effective driving licence and registration certificate at the time of alleged accident. The answering respondent has been falsely implicated by the claimant in collusion with the police just to get compensation and so, he is not liable to pay any compensation and prayed for dismissal the instant claim petition. 4Respondent no.2 took preliminary objections regarding no cause of action; maintainability; that the claim is bad by the principles of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence; that the claim petition is bad for non- joinder and mis-joinder of parties; the person driving the car bearing Registration No. CH-04-H-4936 was not having a valid and effective DL at the time of accident & further was not qualified or obtaining such driving licence and has not satisfied the requirements of the Rule No.3 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 and other plea regarding non- compliance of provision u/s 158 (6) of M.V . Act; the answering SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 5 respondent seeks protection under the provision of Section 147 & 149 of the M.V . Act, 1988; the answering respondent takes up all the pleas available to him under Sections 148,167,169 & 170 of MC Act and reserves its right to file amended written statement on disclosure of any relevant fact at a later stage. On merit, it is submitted that no record regarding alleged age, occupation and income of the claimant has been placed on record. No accident as alleged has taken place. However, a false and frivolous FIR No.105 dated 31.10.2014 was lodged after 44 days from the date of the occurrence in order to get compensation from the answering respondent, when in fact, no such type of occurrence had been taken place on 17.09.2014. It is wrong that claimant suffered multiple grievous injuries including fractures and injuries on other parts of body due to this accident. It is wrong that claimant remained admitted in any hospital due to the injuries suffered in a road side accident or that he had spent Rs.2,50,000/- on his treatment, diet etc. However, insurance particular of the vehicle in question has not been verified from the issuing authority, so, at this stage, it is not admitted. But the liability of Insurance Company, if any, subject to the provisions of the M.V . Act and also terms and conditions thereof. The claim petition has been filed after due consultation just to get compensation from the answering respondent on purely made up basis which is not sustainable in the eyes of law and so, answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation and prayed for dismissal the instant claim petition with special costs. SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 6 5Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed vide order dated 08.01.2016:- 1Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1, while driving car bearing Registration No.CH-04-H-4936, resulting into causing injuries to claimant Sarabjeet Singh, as alleged?

OPR. 7Whether respondent no.2 is entitled to take all the defences available to it under the M.V . Act? OPR. 8Relief 6To establish the claim through inquiry, claimant examined following testimonies:- PW1 Baljeet Singh (father of Claimant) tendered affidavit Ex.PW1/A supporting the facts mentioned in the petition. In cross- examination, he answered that the accident has not taken place in his presence nor he was present with his son. He did not make any representation or any complaint to the police for non registration of case regarding this accident. He was also cross-examined on various other SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 7 questions. PW2 Sarabjeet Singh (Claimant) tendered affidavit Ex.PW2/A reiterating the averments made in the petition. In cross- examination, he answered that he is not in possession of any documentary proof regarding his income of Rs.25,000/- per month. On that day, he along with Pritpal started from their village on motorcycle for Gurudwara Sahib Nanyola. The road is single and traffic was plying on that road at that time. The width of said road is about 10/1t feet. His friend Pritpal was not over taking any vehicle at that time who was driving vehicle on his correct left side. The offending driver was also not over taking any vehicle at that time. He remained conscious for about 15 minutes and thereafter, became unconscious. His friend Pritpal also became unconscious after the accident after some time. After the incident, many people were gathered at the spot and they got admitted them, but he cannot tell the name of that fellow. He remained unconscious for about one month and one and half month. Pritpal got discharged from PGI Chandigarh after some days. It is correct that he was discharged from PGI Chandigarh on 14.10.2014. Volunteered he was unconscious after discharge from PGI Chandigarh. His father was not accompanied him at the time of accident. After discharge from PGI Chandigarh on 14.10.2014, he became conscious perhaps after about a week. It is correct that his friend Pritpal did not lodge any complaint with regard to this accident to police station. It is correct that treatment in PGI Chandigarh is almost free of cost, but they had charged from him and against this SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 8 requisite receipts were issued with regard to payment receipts from PGI Chandigarh. It is correct that as and when he visited for follow up treatment to PGI, requisite entries were made in his follow up card. He had not received any compensation with regard to his injuries from any other authority. He was also cross-examined on various questions. PW3 Parmal Singh (Criminal Ahlmad in the Court of Sh. Sher Singh, JMIC, Ambala) produced summoned record pertaining to FIR No.105 dated 31.10.2014 u/ss 279, 337 and 338 of IPC, which is pending before court of Sh.

He took into possession of Car No. CH 04 H 4936 along with DL of accused and insurance vide memo Ex.P4. He further stated that on 6.11.2014, both the vehicles were mechanically examined by mechanic Subhash Chand, which were already exhibited as Ex.P5 and Ex.P6.

She stated that patient was admitted on 17.09.2014 at about 7.30 PM and he was referred from CHC Chodmastpur. On the same day, he was referred to PGI Chandigarh for further treatment. She has proved the copy of bed head ticket as Ex.P10 and refer slip of CHC Chodmastpur as Mark-A. In cross-examination, she answered that Ex.P10 does not bear SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 10 her signatures nor same was prepared by her. She deposed as per record brought by her. She has no personal knowledge of the case. As per Ex.P10, no ruqa was sent to the concerned police station with regard to patient Sarabjeet Singh. PW6 Dr. Ashish Medical Officer, CHC Chaurmastpur stated that he had examined patient Sarabjeet Singh as a case of road side accident on 17.09.2014. No MLR was prepared and patient was referred to GHC Ambala City immediately. He proved the relevant entries in this regard as Ex.P11 and his opinion as Ex.P12.

PW7 (wrongly written as PW6) Dr Arjun Gandotra , Orthopaedic Surgeon, Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt deposed that on 06.04.2014, he was posted at Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt and examined Sarabjeet Singh for assessing his disability. He was suffering from post operative infection on right hip with bilateral knee and right elbow stiffness. His disability was assessed as 25 per cent. He has seen the original disability certificate which bear his signature as well as signatures of other members of the board and same is proved as Ex.P13. In cross- examination, he answered that he never treated the patient prior to issuance of disability certificate. He cannot say how the patient received the injuries. Learned counsel for the claimant tendered documents Ex.13A to Ex.P145 {original medical and other bills} and closed the claimant's SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 11 evidence. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent No.1 tendered documents i.e Ex.R1; copy of driving licence, Ex.R2; copy of insurance of vehicle No. CH-04-H-4936 and Ex.R3; copy of RC of vehicle No. CH-04-H-4936 in his evidence. Learned counsel for respondent No.2 tendered copy of FIR Ex.R4 and insurance policy Ex.R5 and closed evidence of respondent No.2. No rebuttal evidence was led and closed the same. 7I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1: 8Onus to prove this issue is upon claimant. Under this issue, petitioner- claimant is required to prove the fact that motor vehicular accident was occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Respondent no.1, car bearing registration No.CH-04-H-4936, resulting in multiple grievous injuries received by claimant Sarabjeet Singh and as such, he is entitled to appropriate compensation from respondents. Learned counsel for the petitioner-claimant has submitted that PW2 Sarabjeet Singh has proved the fact that respondent no.1, drove Car bearing registration No. CH-04-H-4936, so rashly and negligently and in high speed and hit to his motorcycle, as a result of that, he received multiple grievous injuries. He further argued that there is delay in lodging FIR on three account, firstly, after the accident, condition of claimant -injured was so serious as he remained admitted for long period in PGI SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 12 Chandigarh; secondly, medical officer did not send any information to police and thirdly owner of offending vehicle was interested to make settlement qua compensation outside, but it was not arrived and ultimately FIR No.105 dated 31.10.2014 under Sections 279, 337 and 338 of IPC was registered against respondent no.1 and after investigation final report was also put forth against respondent no.1. He further submitted that accident in question was taken place due to sole rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent no.1 and prayed for deciding this issue in his favour. In support of his contentions, he placed reliance upon case law titled as Ravi Vs. Badrinarayan and others, 2011 ACJ 911(SC), wherein it has been observed that Claim application-F.I.R.- Delay in lodging- Effect of-Truck while being reversed hit and injured a minor boy sitting on the side of the road in front of his house-Accident was witnessed by father of injured and another person and they took him to hospital-Cause of injury mentioned in injury report prepared by the doctor is road accident-Police came to hospital on the next day of accident but no F.I.R was recorded as father of injured was under mental agony and stress and he was more concerned to get medical treatment for his son- Father lodged F.I.R after 3 months of accident and he explained the reasons that his son was seriously injured and his treatment was more important; some persons in the locality pressurized him that compensation matter could be sorted out amicably since driver of vehicle was his neighbour; and he was not aware of the niceties of law that lodging of F.I.R was condition precedent for filing claim application- Owner of truck SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 13 admitted the accident- Neither the driver entered witness box to deny the accident nor the opposite parties led any evidence in rebuttal to the evidence of the claimant- Occurrence of accident due to rash and negligent driving of truck by its driver is thus established- Tribunal dismissed claim application on the ground that F.I.R was lodged belatedly- High Court upheld the order of the Tribunal- Whether the claim application can be dismissed on the ground of delay in lodging F.I.R- Held: No; lodging of F.I.R. certainly proves factum of accident but delay in doing so cannot be the main ground for rejecting claim application. 9On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent no.1&2 has similar argued on this issue that no accident was taken place with the vehicle of respondent No.1, rather, false FIR was lodged after expiry of 44 days. He further argued that claimant sustained injuries due to his own fault and so, respondent no.1 should not be held liable and prayed for deciding this issue against claimant. 10I have given due regard to the rival contentions put forth by learned counsel for respective parties and have evaluated the entire oral evidence coupled with documentary evidence carefully. After thorough examination, it is observed that the petitioner-claimant has come to this Tribunal with categorical stand that the accident was taken place due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle i.e. Car bearing registration No.CH- 04-H-4936 by Respondent No.1, resulting into multiple grievous injuries received by him. In order to prove factum of accident, PW2 {claimant- injured} deposed on similar line according to contents mentioned in the SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 14 petition. Further, PW1 Baljeet Singh has corroborated the version with regard to road accident of PW2 claimant. Although, PW1 and PW2 were cross-examined, but nothing adverse can be extracted disbelieving the factual position of motor vehicular accident except delay in lodging FIR . However, long delay in lodging FIR can be considered on either side. Here, it is evident that claimant received injuries in a road side accident and immediately he was taken to hospital. It was thus incumbent upon medical officer to sent information to police regarding admittance of injured, but no such information was given to police. Further due to serious condition of injured, injured was referred to PGI, Chandigarh, where he remained admitted for long period, however, no police officer could reach there due to non receipt of medical information. The injured remained under treatment after discharge from PGI on 14.10.2014. Further respondent no.1 being driver cum owner was remained in touch with father of injured for the purpose of settle down the claim under compromise. Since claimant was seriously injured and he 'being helpless and dependent upon others, was not in position to look after himself and primary duty of his father was to upkeep his son first and then to initiate further course of action with regard to compensation etc and so statement of PW1 and PW2 are found believable with regard to accident occurred by vehicle of respondent no.1. 11 It would be appropriate to mention here that non-examination of Pritpal would not draw adverse inference, because, statement of injured claimant shall remain on same footing and so mere delay in lodging FIR SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 15 would not dis-entitle him to claim the compensation against Respondent no.1, particularly when, no fraudulent act at the behest of father of claimant or false allegations were found during investigation done by PW4. 12It is quite well settled that the lodging of first information report is not an essential prerequisite for claiming compensation arising from a motor accident. Each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The Tribunal has to decide the case on the basis of evidence available on file without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled preposition of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. It must be remembered that in a criminal case, prosecution is required to prove its case beyond shadow of reasonable doubt. However, in a motor accident claim, the claimant is not required to prove the case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. The claimant is required to establish that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts upon the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way alleged by the claimant. The provisions regarding claim under the Act are enacted by keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimant is always entitled for compensation irrespective whether the police has registered the offence regarding the incident or not because no claim case can be left over on the mercy of the police. SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 16 The respondent no.1, did not appear in the witness box to rebut the stand of petitioner-claimant reasons best known to him. In this way, it can be easily said that petitioner-claimant received multiple injuries in the motor vehicular accident due to rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1, against whom FIR was also lodged and he has also been facing trial as evident on file. In view of law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993(2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008(2) R.C.R. (civil) 774 , and entire facts and circumstances involved therein, this Tribunal is of the considered opinion that there is cogent evidence on file to reach the formidable conclusion that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. Accordingly, issued no.1 is decided in favour of petitioner-claimant. ISSUE NO.2: 13Onus to prove this issue is upon claimant. Under this issue, petitioner- claimant is required to establish that as to what amount of compensation should be assessed. Learned counsel for claimant has submitted that claimant was admitted in PGI Chandigarh, where he remained admitted as indoor patient w.e.f. 18.09.2014 to 14.10.2014. Further, claimant got treatment as bed-ridden and so, he spent amount according to medical bills Ex.P13/A to EX.P145 on his treatment, transporation etc. He further submitted that claimant sustained 25 percent disability as oer certificate EX.P13 and therefore, claimant is entitled to appropriate compensation from all respondents, who are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to him. On the other hand, learned SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 17 counsel for respondents no. 1 has argued that offending vehicle was owned by respondent no.1 as per RC Ex.R3 under vlid D/L Ex.R1, which was duly insured with respondent no.3 vide Insurance Policy Ex.R2 and so, respondent no.2 is liable to indemnify the claim, if it is awarded. Learned counsel for respondent no.2 has contended that although, claimant took treatment as a indoor patient and he had paid medical bills through documents EX.13 TO EX.P74 OF Rs.176689 and EX.P83 to EX.P133 Of Rs.5935/-{total sum of RS.1,82,624}. However, bills Ex.134 to Ex.P145 of Rs. 14900/-, EX.P75 to EX.P82 of Rs. 7800/-and Ex.P 54 &55 relating to use of transportation are procured and manipulated just to extract amount of compensation from insurance company and prayed for discarding such unreliable documents which are not proved on record. 14Having regard to the contention and perusing the record, it is apparent that claimant sustained multiple injuries in this accident. It is evident that claimant was admitted as indoor patient for 25 days in PGI Chandigarh. According to medical bills, it can be gathered that a sum of Rs.1,82,624/- {in round figure Rs.1,83000-} were spent on account of medicine etc. However, other bills are not found acceptable having been not proved and relied only to extract excess amount of compensation. However, period of admission in the hospitals cannot be doubted. Additionally, claimant must have spent some amount on account of rich diet, attendants, transportation, visitors, follow up treatment etc. In Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences versus Prasanth S.Dhananka, 2010 ACJ 38 (SC), by the three-Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court, it was SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 18 observed that sympathy for the victim does not, and should not, come in the way of making a correct assessment, but if a case is made out, the Court must not be chary of awarding adequate compensation. It was further observed that the case of an injured and disabled person is, however, more pitiable and the feeling of hurt, helplessness, despair and often destitution ensues every day. The support that is needed by a severely handicapped person comes at an enormous price, physical, financial and emotional, not only on the victim but even more so on his family and attendants and the stress saps their energy and destroys their equanimity. In Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences versus Prasanth S.Dhananka, 2010 ACJ 38 (SC) , by the three-Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court, it was observed that sympathy for the victim does not, and should not, come in the way of making a correct assessment, but if a case is made out, the Court must not be chary of awarding adequate compensation. It was further observed that the case of an injured and disabled person is, however, more pitiable and the feeling of hurt, helplessness, despair and often destitution ensues every day. The support that is needed by a severely handicapped person comes at an enormous price, physical, financial and emotional, not only on the victim but even more so on his family and attendants and the stress saps their energy and destroys their equanimity. In Raj Kumar versus Ajay Kumar, 2011 ACJ- 1- (SC); it was observed that a person is not only to be compensated for the physical injury, but also for the loss which he suffered as a result of such injury. This means that he is to be compensated for his inability to SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 19 lead a full life, his inability to enjoy those normal amenities which he would have enjoyed but for the injuries, and his inability to earn as much as he used to earn or could have earned. 15 It is further made clear that he received physical permanent disability to the extent of 25 percent as per disability certificate Ex.P13 and was also advised bed rest. In view of extent of physical disability and its nature when examined in the light of Judgment in Ram Kiran Goyal vs Sub Divisional engineer, mechanical and other 2008{2} RCR {Civil} 103, claimant is entitled to Rs.50,000/- @ 2000/- per percent. 16 In view of overall facts and circumstances arising out in this petition, this Tribunal finds justification in assessing compensation according to injuries attributed to claimant as per settled preposition of law in Raj Kumar Vs Ajay Kumar, (2011)1 SCC 343 , the petitioner- claimant is held entitled to the following compensation: Pecuniary damages (Special damages) 25% permanent disability; Rs. 50,000/- (i).Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and miscellaneous expenditure.Rs.1,83000 /-plus {Rs.1000/- per day as indoor patient} Rs.25,000/- including all expenses. (ii).Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising: (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment; (b) Loss of future earning on account of injuries etc. 10000/- nil SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 20 (iii). Future medical expenses. 10,000/ - None-pecuniary damages (General damages) (iv). Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries. 5000/- (v). Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage). nil (vi).Loss of expectation of life ( shortening of normal longevity). nil /- Total Compensation Rs.2,83,000/- 17 In view of law laid down in case New India Assurance company limited versus Charlie and another, 2005 (2) Recent Civil Reports 550 , the petitioner is also entitled to interest @ 7.5% per annum on the total awarded compensation from the date of filing of petition till realization of awarded amount. The computation of compensation is just, equitable and reasonable. Remaining relief sought by petitioner-claimant stand declined. Accordingly, Issue no.2 is decided in the above stated terms, in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.3 to 5 & 7 : 18 The onus to prove these issues is upon Respondents, but they neither pressed these issues nor led any evidence. Further it has been discussed in detail under issue no.1, that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and thus it can not be said that no accident was taken place with offending vehicle or the instant claim petition is not maintainable etc. In this way, it has become obvious for this tribunal that respondents failed to prove these issues and as such this tribunal has left with no other option except to decide the same against Respondents. Accordingly, these issues are decided against SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 21 Respondents. ISSUE NO.6: 19The onus to prove this issue is upon the respondent No.2, who is under the obligation to prove this fact that respondent no. 1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy/cover note and so respondent No.2 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimant. However, it is apparent on the face of record that respondents no.1 has relied RC Ex.R.3 and DL Ex.R1. The offending vehicle as per RC Ex.R3 was insured vide policy EX.R2. Needles to state that Insurance Policy Ex.R2 reveals that offending vehicle was insured with the respondent No.2 at the relevant time. In the fact and circumstances, both respondents are held jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation amount to claimant and respondent no.2 shall indemnify the claim. Accordingly, this Issue is decided against the respondent No.2. ISSUE NO.8 (RELIEF): PETITION SUCCEED S 20In view of the foregoing discussion, instant claim petition stands allowed with costs in a manner that the claimant-petitioner is entitled to compensation of Rs.2,83,000/ - along with interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition till the date of actual payment. The awarded amount along with the interest shall be payable jointly and severally by respondents and respondent no.2 shall indemnify the insured. It is however clarified that 50 percent amount shall be deposited against FDR in any nationalize bank for a period of two years and balance shall be paid to the bank account of claimant as per rules. SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 22 Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.3000/-. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly. After due compliance, file be consigned to records.

Shri Harsh V ohra, Advocate for respondent No.1. Shri R.K. Vig, Counsel for respondent No.2. AWARD:- This claim petition is being instituted for grant of compensation of Rs. 20 lacs on account of injuries caused to claimant in a Motor Vehicular Accident, which was taken place on 17.09.2014 at about 4.00 PM at Turn village Lotton, District Ambala and FIR bearing No.105 dated 31.10.2014 u/ss 279,337 and 338 of IPC was registered against respondent no.1. SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 2 2The necessary facts leading to accident are that on 17.09.2014, the claimant along with his friend Pritpal Singh went to Gurudwara Shahida Sahib at Naneola on Motorcycle bearing registration No. HR-01AD-9762 Hero Honda Splendor of Silver Colour and at that time, Pritpal Singh was driving said motorcycle very carefully after observing all the traffic rules at a moderate speed at his extremely left side of the road while claimant was a pillion rider. When they reached the turn of Village Lotton, then a Swift Car bearing No. CH-04-H-4936 being driven by respondent No.1 in a very rash and negligent manner, came from village Matheri side and struck his car into motorcycle and the impact was so high as a consequence, claimant and Pritpal Singh firstly fell on the car and then on the road. The claimant received several multiple and grievous injuries, including two fractures on his left thigh, right thigh one fracture, on fracture on buttock, left hand fracture, right hand wrist fracture, right arm injury and injuries on other parts of his body. There were gathered public persons. Claimant and Pritpal Singh noted down the number of the car. Ambulance came at the spot. Both were taken to PHC Chaurmastpur and then referred to Civil Hospital Ambala City. The condition of claimant was serious, so they were referred to PGI Chandigarh, where they both were treated. The claimant remained unconscious for several days and could not give any statement. When he regained conscious, then he and Pritpal Singh described about the accident to Baljeet Singh (father of claimant} and one Satwant Singh. The respondents No.1 and 2 requested the claimant and his father for SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 3 compromise and Baljeet Singh was busy in the treatment of the claimant and the claimant and his family members were under the impression that the police has taken action against the respondent No.1, but they came to know that the police has not registered the criminal case against the respondent No.1, then they gave the statement for registration of FIR on 31.10.2014. Second aspect of this claim petition is that claimant was hale and hearty prior to accident but due to the said accident he is still on bed. He and his family members have suffered lot of pain and agony. He has become totally disabled and is unable to do the any job and is unable to do any personal work. He is feeling giddiness due to the said accident. He was the beard-earner of his family and has high hopes in future, which have been shattered. The claimant was employee in Steel Strip Company Lalru but due to the disability caused in his body on account of injuries, he became unable to do any work and cannot even walk without any help. The claimant was also helping his father in cultivating the fields. He remained admitted in PGI for several days and his various operations were conducted. He is still treatment. He has spent more than Rs.2.5 lacs on his treatment, special diet, transportation etc and the family members of the claimant has been looking after him. This accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of car bearing Registration No. CH-04- H-4936 by respondent no.1 and is insured with respondent no.2, and so, both respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to claimant. SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 4 3Upon notice, respondents no.1 and 2 filed written statement separately. Respondent no.1 took preliminary objection regarding maintainability and that present claim petition has been filed by the claimant just to claim the amount against the answering respondent. In fact no accident as alleged was ever occurred with the car bearing Registration No.CH-04-H-4936. On merit, it is submitted that no accident ever took place due to rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1 as alleged. The vehicle of the answering respondent was falsely implicated. However, a false FIR was lodged against him. The car bearing Registration No.CH-04-H-4936 is insured with the respondent No.2 and respondent No.1 was having an effective driving licence and registration certificate at the time of alleged accident. The answering respondent has been falsely implicated by the claimant in collusion with the police just to get compensation and so, he is not liable to pay any compensation and prayed for dismissal the instant claim petition. 4Respondent no.2 took preliminary objections regarding no cause of action; maintainability; that the claim is bad by the principles of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence; that the claim petition is bad for non- joinder and mis-joinder of parties; the person driving the car bearing Registration No. CH-04-H-4936 was not having a valid and effective DL at the time of accident & further was not qualified or obtaining such driving licence and has not satisfied the requirements of the Rule No.3 of the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, 1989 and other plea regarding non- compliance of provision u/s 158 (6) of M.V . Act; the answering SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 5 respondent seeks protection under the provision of Section 147 & 149 of the M.V . Act, 1988; the answering respondent takes up all the pleas available to him under Sections 148,167,169 & 170 of MC Act and reserves its right to file amended written statement on disclosure of any relevant fact at a later stage. On merit, it is submitted that no record regarding alleged age, occupation and income of the claimant has been placed on record. No accident as alleged has taken place. However, a false and frivolous FIR No.105 dated 31.10.2014 was lodged after 44 days from the date of the occurrence in order to get compensation from the answering respondent, when in fact, no such type of occurrence had been taken place on 17.09.2014. It is wrong that claimant suffered multiple grievous injuries including fractures and injuries on other parts of body due to this accident. It is wrong that claimant remained admitted in any hospital due to the injuries suffered in a road side accident or that he had spent Rs.2,50,000/- on his treatment, diet etc. However, insurance particular of the vehicle in question has not been verified from the issuing authority, so, at this stage, it is not admitted. But the liability of Insurance Company, if any, subject to the provisions of the M.V . Act and also terms and conditions thereof. The claim petition has been filed after due consultation just to get compensation from the answering respondent on purely made up basis which is not sustainable in the eyes of law and so, answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation and prayed for dismissal the instant claim petition with special costs. SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 6 5Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed vide order dated 08.01.2016:- 1Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1, while driving car bearing Registration No.CH-04-H-4936, resulting into causing injuries to claimant Sarabjeet Singh, as alleged? OPP. 2If issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom, the claimant is entitled to? OPP. 3Whether petition is not maintainable in the present form? OPR 4Whether the claimant has no cause of action to file the present petition? OPR 5Whether petition is bad for mis-joinder and non-joinder of necessary parties? OPR. 6Whether respondent no.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect? OPR. 7Whether respondent no.2 is entitled to take all the defences available to it under the M.V . Act? OPR. 8Relief 6To establish the claim through inquiry, claimant examined following testimonies:- PW1 Baljeet Singh (father of Claimant) tendered affidavit Ex.PW1/A supporting the facts mentioned in the petition. In cross- examination, he answered that the accident has not taken place in his presence nor he was present with his son. He did not make any representation or any complaint to the police for non registration of case regarding this accident. He was also cross-examined on various other SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 7 questions. PW2 Sarabjeet Singh (Claimant) tendered affidavit Ex.PW2/A reiterating the averments made in the petition. In cross- examination, he answered that he is not in possession of any documentary proof regarding his income of Rs.25,000/- per month. On that day, he along with Pritpal started from their village on motorcycle for Gurudwara Sahib Nanyola. The road is single and traffic was plying on that road at that time. The width of said road is about 10/1t feet. His friend Pritpal was not over taking any vehicle at that time who was driving vehicle on his correct left side. The offending driver was also not over taking any vehicle at that time. He remained conscious for about 15 minutes and thereafter, became unconscious. His friend Pritpal also became unconscious after the accident after some time. After the incident, many people were gathered at the spot and they got admitted them, but he cannot tell the name of that fellow. He remained unconscious for about one month and one and half month. Pritpal got discharged from PGI Chandigarh after some days. It is correct that he was discharged from PGI Chandigarh on 14.10.2014. Volunteered he was unconscious after discharge from PGI Chandigarh. His father was not accompanied him at the time of accident. After discharge from PGI Chandigarh on 14.10.2014, he became conscious perhaps after about a week. It is correct that his friend Pritpal did not lodge any complaint with regard to this accident to police station. It is correct that treatment in PGI Chandigarh is almost free of cost, but they had charged from him and against this SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 8 requisite receipts were issued with regard to payment receipts from PGI Chandigarh. It is correct that as and when he visited for follow up treatment to PGI, requisite entries were made in his follow up card. He had not received any compensation with regard to his injuries from any other authority. He was also cross-examined on various questions. PW3 Parmal Singh (Criminal Ahlmad in the Court of Sh. Sher Singh, JMIC, Ambala) produced summoned record pertaining to FIR No.105 dated 31.10.2014 u/ss 279, 337 and 338 of IPC, which is pending before court of Sh. Sher Singh, Learned JMIC Ambala, for prosecution evidence for 05.05.2016. He further stated that the charges against the accused Paramjeet Singh were framed on 16.03.2015. The offending car No. CH 04 H 4936 was released on superdari to Paramjeet Singh son of Jagdev Singh, R/o Mauli Jagran, Chandigarh and also resident of Devigarh District Patiala. He has also produced documents i.e copy of FIR Ex.P1, copy of complaint Ex.P3, Copy of seizure memo Ex.P3, copy of recovery memo Ex.P4, copy of mechanical reports Ex.P5 and Ex.P6, copy of recovery memo of RC of motorcycle Ex.P7, Copy of seizure memo Ex.P8 and Copy of medico legal case summary Ex.P9. He was cross-examined on various questions. PW4 ASI Om Parkash, stated that he was posted as In- charge Police Post Naneola, P.S. Naggal. On that day, he received complaint Ex.P3 from Baljeet Singh, who was accompanied by Satwant Singh. He prepared the endorsement Ex.P10 and sent the information through writing {Tehrir} by ESI Satwant Singh, on which FIR No.105 SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 9 dated 31.10.2014 u/ss 279, 337 and 338 of IPC was registered in P.S. Naggal. He went to spot and prepared site plan on the demarcation of Pritpal Singh. He recorded statement of witnesses. He took into possession motorcycle No. HR-01-AD-9762 along with treatment record of Sarabjeet Singh. He arrested the accused Paramjeet Singh on01.11.2014. He took into possession of Car No. CH 04 H 4936 along with DL of accused and insurance vide memo Ex.P4. He further stated that on 6.11.2014, both the vehicles were mechanically examined by mechanic Subhash Chand, which were already exhibited as Ex.P5 and Ex.P6. On 22.11.2014, Baljeet Singh handed over the RC of motorcycle No. HR 01-AD-9762 vide memo which is already exhibited as Ex.P7.

Thereafter, he obtained the medico legal case summary of Sarabjeet Singh which is already exhibited as Ex.P9. Final report Ex.P4 was prepared and was submitted before th court. He was cross-examined on various questions. PW5 Sushma, Record Keeper, Civil Hospital, Ambala City brought the summoned record pertaining to patient Sarabjeet Singh (claimant). She stated that patient was admitted on 17.09.2014 at about 7.30 PM and he was referred from CHC Chodmastpur. On the same day, he was referred to PGI Chandigarh for further treatment. She has proved the copy of bed head ticket as Ex.P10 and refer slip of CHC Chodmastpur as Mark-A. In cross-examination, she answered that Ex.P10 does not bear SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 10 her signatures nor same was prepared by her. She deposed as per record brought by her. She has no personal knowledge of the case. As per Ex.P10, no ruqa was sent to the concerned police station with regard to patient Sarabjeet Singh. PW6 Dr. Ashish Medical Officer, CHC Chaurmastpur stated that he had examined patient Sarabjeet Singh as a case of road side accident on 17.09.2014. No MLR was prepared and patient was referred to GHC Ambala City immediately. He proved the relevant entries in this regard as Ex.P11 and his opinion as Ex.P12. In cross-examination, he answered that he cannot say who brought the patient to the hospital. No information {ruqa} was sent to concerned police station. No such person namely Pritpal Singh visited hospital on 17.09.2014. PW7 (wrongly written as PW6) Dr Arjun Gandotra , Orthopaedic Surgeon, Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt deposed that on 06.04.2014, he was posted at Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt and examined Sarabjeet Singh for assessing his disability. He was suffering from post operative infection on right hip with bilateral knee and right elbow stiffness. His disability was assessed as 25 per cent. He has seen the original disability certificate which bear his signature as well as signatures of other members of the board and same is proved as Ex.P13. In cross- examination, he answered that he never treated the patient prior to issuance of disability certificate. He cannot say how the patient received the injuries. Learned counsel for the claimant tendered documents Ex.13A to Ex.P145 {original medical and other bills} and closed the claimant's SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 11 evidence. On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent No.1 tendered documents i.e Ex.R1; copy of driving licence, Ex.R2; copy of insurance of vehicle No. CH-04-H-4936 and Ex.R3; copy of RC of vehicle No. CH-04-H-4936 in his evidence. Learned counsel for respondent No.2 tendered copy of FIR Ex.R4 and insurance policy Ex.R5 and closed evidence of respondent No.2. No rebuttal evidence was led and closed the same. 7I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1: 8Onus to prove this issue is upon claimant. Under this issue, petitioner- claimant is required to prove the fact that motor vehicular accident was occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Respondent no.1, car bearing registration No.CH-04-H-4936, resulting in multiple grievous injuries received by claimant Sarabjeet Singh and as such, he is entitled to appropriate compensation from respondents. Learned counsel for the petitioner-claimant has submitted that PW2 Sarabjeet Singh has proved the fact that respondent no.1, drove Car bearing registration No. CH-04-H-4936, so rashly and negligently and in high speed and hit to his motorcycle, as a result of that, he received multiple grievous injuries. He further argued that there is delay in lodging FIR on three account, firstly, after the accident, condition of claimant -injured was so serious as he remained admitted for long period in PGI SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 12 Chandigarh; secondly, medical officer did not send any information to police and thirdly owner of offending vehicle was interested to make settlement qua compensation outside, but it was not arrived and ultimately FIR No.105 dated 31.10.2014 under Sections 279, 337 and 338 of IPC was registered against respondent no.1 and after investigation final report was also put forth against respondent no.1. He further submitted that accident in question was taken place due to sole rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent no.1 and prayed for deciding this issue in his favour. In support of his contentions, he placed reliance upon case law titled as Ravi Vs. Badrinarayan and others, 2011 ACJ 911(SC), wherein it has been observed that Claim application-F.I.R.- Delay in lodging- Effect of-Truck while being reversed hit and injured a minor boy sitting on the side of the road in front of his house-Accident was witnessed by father of injured and another person and they took him to hospital-Cause of injury mentioned in injury report prepared by the doctor is road accident-Police came to hospital on the next day of accident but no F.I.R was recorded as father of injured was under mental agony and stress and he was more concerned to get medical treatment for his son- Father lodged F.I.R after 3 months of accident and he explained the reasons that his son was seriously injured and his treatment was more important; some persons in the locality pressurized him that compensation matter could be sorted out amicably since driver of vehicle was his neighbour; and he was not aware of the niceties of law that lodging of F.I.R was condition precedent for filing claim application- Owner of truck SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 13 admitted the accident- Neither the driver entered witness box to deny the accident nor the opposite parties led any evidence in rebuttal to the evidence of the claimant- Occurrence of accident due to rash and negligent driving of truck by its driver is thus established- Tribunal dismissed claim application on the ground that F.I.R was lodged belatedly- High Court upheld the order of the Tribunal- Whether the claim application can be dismissed on the ground of delay in lodging F.I.R- Held: No; lodging of F.I.R. certainly proves factum of accident but delay in doing so cannot be the main ground for rejecting claim application. 9On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent no.1&2 has similar argued on this issue that no accident was taken place with the vehicle of respondent No.1, rather, false FIR was lodged after expiry of 44 days. He further argued that claimant sustained injuries due to his own fault and so, respondent no.1 should not be held liable and prayed for deciding this issue against claimant. 10I have given due regard to the rival contentions put forth by learned counsel for respective parties and have evaluated the entire oral evidence coupled with documentary evidence carefully. After thorough examination, it is observed that the petitioner-claimant has come to this Tribunal with categorical stand that the accident was taken place due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle i.e. Car bearing registration No.CH- 04-H-4936 by Respondent No.1, resulting into multiple grievous injuries received by him. In order to prove factum of accident, PW2 {claimant- injured} deposed on similar line according to contents mentioned in the SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 14 petition. Further, PW1 Baljeet Singh has corroborated the version with regard to road accident of PW2 claimant. Although, PW1 and PW2 were cross-examined, but nothing adverse can be extracted disbelieving the factual position of motor vehicular accident except delay in lodging FIR . However, long delay in lodging FIR can be considered on either side. Here, it is evident that claimant received injuries in a road side accident and immediately he was taken to hospital. It was thus incumbent upon medical officer to sent information to police regarding admittance of injured, but no such information was given to police. Further due to serious condition of injured, injured was referred to PGI, Chandigarh, where he remained admitted for long period, however, no police officer could reach there due to non receipt of medical information. The injured remained under treatment after discharge from PGI on 14.10.2014. Further respondent no.1 being driver cum owner was remained in touch with father of injured for the purpose of settle down the claim under compromise. Since claimant was seriously injured and he 'being helpless and dependent upon others, was not in position to look after himself and primary duty of his father was to upkeep his son first and then to initiate further course of action with regard to compensation etc and so statement of PW1 and PW2 are found believable with regard to accident occurred by vehicle of respondent no.1. 11 It would be appropriate to mention here that non-examination of Pritpal would not draw adverse inference, because, statement of injured claimant shall remain on same footing and so mere delay in lodging FIR SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 15 would not dis-entitle him to claim the compensation against Respondent no.1, particularly when, no fraudulent act at the behest of father of claimant or false allegations were found during investigation done by PW4. 12It is quite well settled that the lodging of first information report is not an essential prerequisite for claiming compensation arising from a motor accident. Each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The Tribunal has to decide the case on the basis of evidence available on file without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled preposition of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. It must be remembered that in a criminal case, prosecution is required to prove its case beyond shadow of reasonable doubt. However, in a motor accident claim, the claimant is not required to prove the case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. The claimant is required to establish that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts upon the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way alleged by the claimant. The provisions regarding claim under the Act are enacted by keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimant is always entitled for compensation irrespective whether the police has registered the offence regarding the incident or not because no claim case can be left over on the mercy of the police. SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 16 The respondent no.1, did not appear in the witness box to rebut the stand of petitioner-claimant reasons best known to him. In this way, it can be easily said that petitioner-claimant received multiple injuries in the motor vehicular accident due to rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1, against whom FIR was also lodged and he has also been facing trial as evident on file. In view of law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993(2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008(2) R.C.R. (civil) 774 , and entire facts and circumstances involved therein, this Tribunal is of the considered opinion that there is cogent evidence on file to reach the formidable conclusion that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. Accordingly, issued no.1 is decided in favour of petitioner-claimant. ISSUE NO.2: 13Onus to prove this issue is upon claimant. Under this issue, petitioner- claimant is required to establish that as to what amount of compensation should be assessed. Learned counsel for claimant has submitted that claimant was admitted in PGI Chandigarh, where he remained admitted as indoor patient w.e.f. 18.09.2014 to 14.10.2014. Further, claimant got treatment as bed-ridden and so, he spent amount according to medical bills Ex.P13/A to EX.P145 on his treatment, transporation etc. He further submitted that claimant sustained 25 percent disability as oer certificate EX.P13 and therefore, claimant is entitled to appropriate compensation from all respondents, who are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to him. On the other hand, learned SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 17 counsel for respondents no. 1 has argued that offending vehicle was owned by respondent no.1 as per RC Ex.R3 under vlid D/L Ex.R1, which was duly insured with respondent no.3 vide Insurance Policy Ex.R2 and so, respondent no.2 is liable to indemnify the claim, if it is awarded. Learned counsel for respondent no.2 has contended that although, claimant took treatment as a indoor patient and he had paid medical bills through documents EX.13 TO EX.P74 OF Rs.176689 and EX.P83 to EX.P133 Of Rs.5935/-{total sum of RS.1,82,624}. However, bills Ex.134 to Ex.P145 of Rs. 14900/-, EX.P75 to EX.P82 of Rs. 7800/-and Ex.P 54 &55 relating to use of transportation are procured and manipulated just to extract amount of compensation from insurance company and prayed for discarding such unreliable documents which are not proved on record. 14Having regard to the contention and perusing the record, it is apparent that claimant sustained multiple injuries in this accident. It is evident that claimant was admitted as indoor patient for 25 days in PGI Chandigarh. According to medical bills, it can be gathered that a sum of Rs.1,82,624/- {in round figure Rs.1,83000-} were spent on account of medicine etc. However, other bills are not found acceptable having been not proved and relied only to extract excess amount of compensation. However, period of admission in the hospitals cannot be doubted. Additionally, claimant must have spent some amount on account of rich diet, attendants, transportation, visitors, follow up treatment etc. In Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences versus Prasanth S.Dhananka, 2010 ACJ 38 (SC), by the three-Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court, it was SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 18 observed that sympathy for the victim does not, and should not, come in the way of making a correct assessment, but if a case is made out, the Court must not be chary of awarding adequate compensation. It was further observed that the case of an injured and disabled person is, however, more pitiable and the feeling of hurt, helplessness, despair and often destitution ensues every day. The support that is needed by a severely handicapped person comes at an enormous price, physical, financial and emotional, not only on the victim but even more so on his family and attendants and the stress saps their energy and destroys their equanimity. In Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences versus Prasanth S.Dhananka, 2010 ACJ 38 (SC) , by the three-Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court, it was observed that sympathy for the victim does not, and should not, come in the way of making a correct assessment, but if a case is made out, the Court must not be chary of awarding adequate compensation. It was further observed that the case of an injured and disabled person is, however, more pitiable and the feeling of hurt, helplessness, despair and often destitution ensues every day. The support that is needed by a severely handicapped person comes at an enormous price, physical, financial and emotional, not only on the victim but even more so on his family and attendants and the stress saps their energy and destroys their equanimity. In Raj Kumar versus Ajay Kumar, 2011 ACJ- 1- (SC); it was observed that a person is not only to be compensated for the physical injury, but also for the loss which he suffered as a result of such injury. This means that he is to be compensated for his inability to SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 19 lead a full life, his inability to enjoy those normal amenities which he would have enjoyed but for the injuries, and his inability to earn as much as he used to earn or could have earned. 15 It is further made clear that he received physical permanent disability to the extent of 25 percent as per disability certificate Ex.P13 and was also advised bed rest. In view of extent of physical disability and its nature when examined in the light of Judgment in Ram Kiran Goyal vs Sub Divisional engineer, mechanical and other 2008{2} RCR {Civil} 103, claimant is entitled to Rs.50,000/- @ 2000/- per percent. 16 In view of overall facts and circumstances arising out in this petition, this Tribunal finds justification in assessing compensation according to injuries attributed to claimant as per settled preposition of law in Raj Kumar Vs Ajay Kumar, (2011)1 SCC 343 , the petitioner- claimant is held entitled to the following compensation: Pecuniary damages (Special damages) 25% permanent disability; Rs. 50,000/- (i).Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and miscellaneous expenditure.Rs.1,83000 /-plus {Rs.1000/- per day as indoor patient} Rs.25,000/- including all expenses. (ii).Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising: (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment; (b) Loss of future earning on account of injuries etc. 10000/- nil SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 20 (iii). Future medical expenses. 10,000/ - None-pecuniary damages (General damages) (iv). Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries. 5000/- (v). Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage). nil (vi).Loss of expectation of life ( shortening of normal longevity). nil /- Total Compensation Rs.2,83,000/- 17 In view of law laid down in case New India Assurance company limited versus Charlie and another, 2005 (2) Recent Civil Reports 550 , the petitioner is also entitled to interest @ 7.5% per annum on the total awarded compensation from the date of filing of petition till realization of awarded amount. The computation of compensation is just, equitable and reasonable. Remaining relief sought by petitioner-claimant stand declined. Accordingly, Issue no.2 is decided in the above stated terms, in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.3 to 5 & 7 : 18 The onus to prove these issues is upon Respondents, but they neither pressed these issues nor led any evidence. Further it has been discussed in detail under issue no.1, that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and thus it can not be said that no accident was taken place with offending vehicle or the instant claim petition is not maintainable etc. In this way, it has become obvious for this tribunal that respondents failed to prove these issues and as such this tribunal has left with no other option except to decide the same against Respondents. Accordingly, these issues are decided against SARABJEET SINGH VS PARAMJEET SINGH ETC 21 Respondents. ISSUE NO.6: 19The onus to prove this issue is upon the respondent No.2, who is under the obligation to prove this fact that respondent no. 1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy/cover note and so respondent No.2 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimant. However, it is apparent on the face of record that respondents no.1 has relied RC Ex.R.3 and DL Ex.R1. The offending vehicle as per RC Ex.R3 was insured vide policy EX.R2. Needles to state that Insurance Policy Ex.R2 reveals that offending vehicle was insured with the respondent No.2 at the relevant time. In the fact and circumstances, both respondents are held jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation amount to claimant and respondent no.2 shall indemnify the claim. Accordingly, this Issue is decided against the respondent No.2. ISSUE NO.8 (RELIEF): PETITION SUCCEED S 20In view of the foregoing discussion, instant claim petition stands allowed with costs in a manner that the claimant-petitioner is entitled to compensation of Rs.2,83,000/ - along with interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition till the date of actual payment.

Due to darkness the deceased could not see the said truck-trolla and the motorcycle of the deceased entered under the said truck-trolla from rear side, as a result of which the deceased sustained grievous injuries and died at the spot. The accident was witnessed by Surjit Singh. Matter was reported to the police and FIR was got registered against the respondent no.1. Lastly, it was prayed that compensation amount to the tune of Rs. 1 crore be awarded to them on account of death of deceased Ghotra Jaswinder Singh son of Kashmir Singh along with interest @ 18% per annum, from the date of filing of the petition till its realization, for which Jagjit Singh, MACT Manjit Kaur & Anr. Vs. Satvinder Singh etc. 3 respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation. 3)The respondents No.1 and 2 being driver and owner of the offending truck filed joint written statement and denied the averments made in the petition and stated that no accident took place due to negligent act of respondent no.1, however, a false and frivolous FIR was registered against the respondent no.1 just to fetch the claim. All other material averments were denied and lastly prayed for dismissal of the petition. 4)Respondent No.3 Insurance Company contested the petition by filing separate joint written statement and it was submitted that driver of the offending vehicle/respondent No.1 was not having valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident and insured willfully violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. The factum of accident as alleged by the claimants in the petition was denied and submitted that a false FIR has been registered against respondent No.1 in collusion with the police. Remaining contents of the petition were denied and prayer to dismiss the petition was made. 5)Replication was not filed. From the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed :- 1.Whether the accident in question causing death of Ghotra Jaswinder Singh took place due to rash and negligent driving of Truck-Trolla bearing registration No.HR-55A-2566 by respondent no.1, as alleged?

My issue-wise finding are given as under:- ISSUE No.1:- 10)The onus of proving this issue was on the petitioners and to prove the same, learned counsel for the petitioners argued that on 19.11.2014 Jaswinder Singh was coming from Barara to his village Nahra on motorcycle bearing registration No.HR-54A-9796 and at about 6.30 P.M. a truck-trollay bearing registration No.HR-55A-2566 was wrongly parked in the middle of the road by the respondent no.1 without any indicator and parking light and neither any signal was blown and due to darkness Jaswinder Singh could not see the same and motorcycle struck with the truck-trolla and he received serious injuries and succumbed to the same and FIR was got registered on the statement of Surjit Singh, PW- 3, against the respondent no.1, who was facing trial for the said offence. Jagjit Singh, MACT Manjit Kaur & Anr. Vs. Satvinder Singh etc. 7 The FIR is Ex.P-22 and it mentions the number of the offending truck and the manner in which the accident was caused. This has been deposed in the witness box by Surjit Singh and the respondent no.1 was facing trial for the said offence and charge sheet against him is Ex.P-24 and the report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. is Ex.P-23. 11)Learned counsel for the respondents meanwhile argued that no such accident was ever caused by the respondent no.1 and a false claim petition has been filed by the petitioners. 12)I have heard the counsels for the parties and perused the file carefully. 13)The FIR, Ex.P-22 mentions the manner in which the accident was caused and it also mentions the number of the offending truck parked in a negligent manner on the road, which was further deposed by Surjit Singh in the witness box who was scribe of the FIR. No rebuttal to this has come on the part of the respondents. Even otherwise, it is observed by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in Smt. Surinder Kaur and others Versus Lakhbir Singh and another 2007(1) PLR 494 that; “F.I.R.-Being a public document is admissible in evidence as such and if no objection is raised at the time of production thereof, the same is to be read in evidence.” Similar view was held by the Hon’ble Punjab and Haryana Jagjit Singh, MACT Manjit Kaur & Anr. Vs. Satvinder Singh etc. 8 High Court in Bansi Yadav and another Versus Krishan Kumar and another 2004(3) ACC 758. Keeping in view the principle laid down in authorities (Supra), it becomes clear that the FIR being a public document and when not rebutted is to be considered as true. It is also important to note that the proceedings in MACT cases are of summary nature and the case is not to be proved like civil case where case is to be proved from the point of preponderance of probabilities or in criminal case, where charge is to be proved beyond shadows of doubt. The FIR has been registered against the respondent no.1. So, in view of law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993(2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008(2) R.C.R. (civil) 774, it can be safely held that the accident in question took place due to negligence of truck-trolla bearing registration No.HR-55A-2566 by respondent no.1. Accordingly, issue no.1 is decided in favour of the petitioners. ISSUES No.2 AND 3:- 14)The onus of proving issue no.2 was on the petitioners while onus of proving issue no.3 was upon the respondents. Finding of one issue shall have bearing on the other and hence the same are being decided together. To prove the above issues, learned counsel for the petitioners argued that the deceased Jaswinder Singh was 18 years old and unmarried Jagjit Singh, MACT Manjit Kaur & Anr. Vs. Satvinder Singh etc. 9 and he was employed in the country of Italy where he was earning a handsome amount. He has left behind his parents as his dependents. The deceased was working in two companies in Italy and getting about Rs.800 EURO per month. The untimely death has caused great loss to the claimants and thus they are entitled to be compensated accordingly. 15)Learned counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 meanwhile argued that respondent no.1 never caused any accident but even if the Tribunal comes to such conclusion, then the respondent no.1 holds a valid Driving Licence, Ex.R-1 and the registration certificate is Ex.R-2 and insurance policy is Ex.R-4 and permit is Ex.R-12 and in case any compensation is to be paid, the same is to be paid by respondent no.3. 16) Learned counsel for respondent no.3 meanwhile argued that in the present case it were the respondents no.1 and 2 who are liable to pay the amount of compensation and moreover, the deceased himself contributed to the accident by hitting his motorcycle into a parked truck. PW-3 is not an eye-witness of the occurrence. That the deceased was a minor at the time of accident and his alleged earning in Italy is not proved by merely tendering of the documents when none appeared to say as to whether actually the deceased was employed anywhere or was earning any amount. The deceased was a unqualified person and doing four hour job as alleged but this cannot be taken into consideration. It was argued that deceased was unmarried and multiplier Jagjit Singh, MACT Manjit Kaur & Anr. Vs. Satvinder Singh etc. 10 that would be apply would be that of his mother and moreover, the license of respondent no.1 was not a valid license as per report received by the respondent no.3 in the RTI Act wherein report Ex.R-8 attached with notification, Ex.R-10 clearly says that Smart Card format had been issued by the concerned Licensing Authority, whereas the respondent no.1 was relying upon a formal license which was not in existence when the said accident was caused. As a result, the respondents no.1 and 2 were liable to pay the amount of compensation in the present case. 17)Learned counsel for the claimants rebutting the arguments stated that the deceased was entitled to amount of future prospectus in view of the principles laid down in Rajesh & Ors. Vs. Rajbir Singh & Ors., 2013(3) Civil Court Cases 15 and also the claimants are entitled to amount of loss of love and affection as held in Kalpanaraj & Ors. Vs. Tamil Nadu State Transport Corpn. 2014(3) Civil Court Cases 456 . With regard to arguments of deceased having contributed towards the accident, reliance was placed upon the principles laid down in The Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Smt. Surinder Kaur etc. , FAO No.2349 of 200, Decided on 14.05.2012 and Arjun Singh & Anr. Vs. Rajbir Singh & Anr., 2010(1) PLR 646 , where it was held that it was the parked truck without any signal, which was liable. 18)I have heard the learned counsels for the parties and have perused the case file carefully. Jagjit Singh, MACT Manjit Kaur & Anr. Vs. Satvinder Singh etc. 11 19)Firstly with regard to the amount of compensation to which the petitioners were entitled, it is seen that the petitioners are the mother and father of the deceased and nothing come on file to prove about any dependency of the father upon the deceased and as such it is only the petitioner no1 who is entitled to compensation in the present case. With regard to the contention of deceased earning handsome amount in Italy, the documents produced on file were subject to their evidentiary value and except that nothing has come on the part of the petitioners to prove those documents and as to whether actually the deceased was earning any amount in Italy. Moreover, Hon'ble Supreme Court observed in United India Insurance Co. Ltd. & Ors. Vs. Patricia Jean Mahajan & Ors., 2002(3) PLR 281 , that “Deceased 47-48 years – American National – Looking by the Indian standards they may not be much too over compensated and similarly not very much under compensated as well, in the background of the country where most of the dependent beneficiaries reside. ” With regard to contention of future prospects to the deceased, the Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court has held in Smt. Savita & Ors. Vs. Satpal & Ors., 2015(4) PLR 854 , that “Future Prospects – Matter has been referred to Larger Bench of Supreme Court – Since reference has been made in different cases to larger bench for finally deciding the point regarding grant of future prospects, it would not be Jagjit Singh, MACT Manjit Kaur & Anr. Vs. Satvinder Singh etc. 12 advisable to grant the same now because in case a divergent view is received from the Supreme Court later on, it will not be possible to the Insurance Company to make recovery .” 20)With regard to the negligence of the deceased and contributing towards the accident, it is seen that no evidence came on file to prove regarding the parking of truck with some signal or indicator and under these circumstances the deceased could not have been aware about the same and therefore, cannot be held liable for contributing towards the accident. With regard to the multiplier that would apply in the present case, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has held in National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Shyam Singh & Ors., 2011(4) PLR 113 , that “Deceased – aged 19 years – Parents who are claimants aged 56 and 55 years – Multiplier of 18 as enhanced by the High Court reduced the same to 8 by taking average age of the parents by Tribunal. ” It was further held by the Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Raj Kumar & Ors. , FAO No.2962 of 2012, decided on 05.11.2014, that “Learned counsel for the Insurance Company relied on the authority reported as New India Assurance Company Ltd. Vs. Smt. Shanti Pathak and Others, 2007(3) RCR (Civil) 593 , in which it was held by the Supreme Court that the age of the claimants was required to be noticed Jagjit Singh, MACT Manjit Kaur & Anr. Vs. Satvinder Singh etc. 13 and it was made basis for applying the multiplier. The said judgment cited by the Insurance Company having been delivered by a larger Bench of the Apex Court, must prevail. It is, therefore, held that for applying multiplier, the age of the mother of the deceased would be considered.” The principles laid down in all the authorities (Supra), the petitioner no.1 becomes entitled to the following amount of compensation. The deceased in the year 2014 being about 18 years old can be said to atleast earning Rs.7000/- per month even as a labourer and his annual earning would thus come to Rs.84,000/-. Being bachelor ½ of the amount is to be deducted towards personal living and expenses of the deceased and the remaining amount comes to Rs.42,000/-. The mother of the deceased as per her Passport was born on 24.09.1972 and in the year 2014 she would be 42 years old and the multiplier that would apply in the present case would be that of '14'. By applying the same the amount comes to Rs.5,88,000/-. Alongwith this the petitioner no.1 would also be entitled to Rs.25,000/- for performing last rites of the deceased and the petitioner no.1 would further be entitled to a sum of Rs.50,000/- for loss of love and affection of her son. The petitioner no.1 would also become entitled to interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization. Jagjit Singh, MACT Manjit Kaur & Anr. Vs. Satvinder Singh etc. 14 21)With regard to respondents liable to pay the amount of compensation, the respondent no.3 relied upon the information sought under the RTI where the license of the respondent no.1 is held to be fake. As per report Ex.R-8 since all license holders were asked to get Smart Card format license issued and anyone carrying license after 01.12.2014 and not Smart Card License, then earlier license is to be treated as cancelled. The respondent no.1 failed to produce any such Smart Card License on file and hence there was violation of the terms and conditions of the policy and therefore, although all the respondents would jointly pay the amount of compensation in the present case and the respondent no.3 is granted a right of recovery from respondents No.1 and 2. Accordingly, issue no.2 is decided in favour of the petitioners, while issue no.3 is decided in favour of the respondent No.3. ISSUE NO. 4 (RELIEF):- 22)Keeping in view of my detailed discussion on all the aforesaid issues, the petition is allowed with costs. The petitioner no.1 is entitled to the amount of Rs.6,13,000/- as compensation, besides Rs.50,000/- on account of loss of love and affection of her son. The petitioner no.1 is also entitled for the interest of 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of petition till actual realization. Amount of award be given to the petitioner no.1 by way of cash. The respondents No.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of Jagjit Singh, MACT Manjit Kaur & Anr. Vs. Satvinder Singh etc. 15 compensation and the respondent no.4 is given right of recovery from respondents No.1 and 2 . Memo of costs be prepared accordingly and file be consigned to record room after due compliance. Pronounced in open Court (JAGJIT SINGH) Dated: 14.01.2016 Motor Accident Claims Tribunal Ambala.

My issue-wise finding are given as under:- ISSUE No.1:- 10)The onus of proving this issue was on the petitioners and to prove the same, learned counsel for the petitioners argued that on 17.12.2014 Gurbhajan Kumar, husband of petitioner no.1 was going on his motorcycle bearing registration No.HR-01AG-4901 from Ambala Cantt to Saha in a careful manner and meanwhile a Alto Car bearing registration No.HR-54C-7075 driven by respondent no.1 came in high speed and without any signal struck against the motorcycle, as a result of which Gurbhajan Kumar fell down on the road and suffered severe injuries and the accident was witnessed by PW-2 Raj Kumar, who noted down the number of the Alto Car. The injured was taken to the hospital. The witness PW-2 got recorded his statement with the police on 18.12.2014 when he came to know about the death of Gurbhajan Kumar, whom he had sent in an Ambulance in the hospital. Also present at the Jagjit Singh, MACT Manju Rani etc. Vs.Harvinder Singh etc. 7 spot was Laxmi Chand and he got recorded the FIR. The FIR was promptly recorded and this has also been deposed by the petitioner Manju Kumari in the witness box and respondent no.1 was facing trial for the said accident as deposed by PW-3 and no rebuttal to this evidence has come from the respondents which clearly proves about accident caused by rash and negligent driving of his vehicle by respondent no.1. 11)Learned counsel for the respondents No.1 and 2 meanwhile argued that no accident was caused by any act of the respondent no.1, while learned counsel for respondent no.3 argued that the present petition has been filed on false averments and no accident was caused by any act of the respondent no.1. That the FIR in the present case is lodged against unknown person and neither is there mention of any vehicle involved in the accident. The witness PW-2 who stated to be an eye-witness did not get the FIR recorded and the presence of Laxmi Chand at the spot is also doubtful. It was argued that the statement of Raj Kumar, PW-2 recorded under Section 161 Cr.P.C. in the criminal case, which is Ex.R-4 clearly mentions that some unknown vehicle had caused the accident and this contradict the statement made by him in the present petition. Jagjit Singh, MACT Manju Rani etc. Vs.Harvinder Singh etc. 8 The learned counsel further pointed out to the testimony of the witnesses examined wherein PW-2, the alleged eye-witness has stated about FIR having been got recorded on the statement of Laxmi Chand but in his statement, Ex.R-4, there was no mention of Laxmi Chand to be present at the spot. In his cross-examination as PW-2 he stated about presence of many persons at the spot and he was unable to tell as to who called the ambulance. He further said that he did not meet Laxmi Chand son of Chandu Ram at the spot on 17.12.2014 which further goes to show about the absence of Laxmi Chand at the spot. He stated not having made any call on Phone No.100 to the police regarding the said accident and he never visited any Police Station to lodge the complaint. He further stated that Laxmi Chand met him on the next day at the place of accident and he was not aware whether the FIR was got recorded by Laxmi Chand. He was shown his statement in examination-in-chief that the FIR was got recorded on the statement of Laxmi Chand and he stated that this was not correct. He stated to have never visited hospital after 17.12.2014 to verify about the injured person and his statement was recorded in Police Station Mahesh Nagar on 18.12.2014 which he never visited after the said date. He stated about Laxmi Chand having told him the name of the motorcyclist and his father's name but nothing could be shown as to why Jagjit Singh, MACT Manju Rani etc. Vs.Harvinder Singh etc. 9 Laxmi Chand was aware about all this despite his absence at the spot. It was thus argued that all these circumstances clearly showed a false petition having been filed only to seek compensation. 12)I have heard the counsels for the parties and perused the file carefully. 13)As per averments of the petitioner her husband Gurbhajan Kuamr was travelling on his motorcycle on 17.12.2014 at about 9:45 P.M. and in the presence of PW-2 Raj Kumar, who was going in a separate car it was seen by Raj Kumar that a Alto car bearing registration No.HR-54C- 7075 caused the accident with Gurbhajan Kumar and the number of the vehicle was noted by Raj Kumar and he sent the injured to the hospital and left for his house and got recorded his statement to the police on 18.12.2014 while going from his village to Ambala Cantt. During his cross-examination, however, the witness does not support the averments made in the examination-in-chief. Firstly in his statement he has stated that Laxmi Chand son of Chandu Ram was also present at the spot and FIR was got recorded on his statement. During his cross-examination he stated that this statement made by him was not true. Further he stated that he had not met Laxmi Chand at the spot and he only met Laxmi Chand on the next day at the place of accident. He further Jagjit Singh, MACT Manju Rani etc. Vs.Harvinder Singh etc. 10 stated to have not called the Ambulance at the spot and neither was he aware as to who called the same. He also stated not having visited the Police Station to report about the accident and neither did he visit the hospital to enquire about the injured. It was required on the part of the petitioners to prove rash and negligent act of the respondent no.1 while driving his vehicle and by such act causing the accident. The law is well settled that merely because the respondent no.1 is facing criminal trial for the accident and even if charge is framed or even if persons is convicted or acquitted it would not effect the petition filed before the Claims Tribunal. Reliance in this regard can be placed upon the principles laid down in Ram Karan Vs. Zile Singh, 2001(3) RCR (Civil) 582 , where it was held that “ Mere an FIR, framing of charge and even judgment of conviction or acquittal of criminal court is not binding on the Tribunal – The onus of proving negligence is always upon the claimants and they have to discharge it before the Tribunal.” It is further seen that it was for the petitioner to prove that it was respondent no.1 who was driving his vehicle and caused the accident. The FIR is silent both with regard to the person driving the vehicle as also the number of the vehicle which caused the accident. Even the FIR was Jagjit Singh, MACT Manju Rani etc. Vs.Harvinder Singh etc. 11 got recorded on the next day on the statement of Laxmi Chand, whose presence at the spot is doubtful and he could not have been aware about the person who caused the accident. The conduct of Raj Kumar, alleged eye-witness also shows that even his presence at the spot is doubtful and both Laxmi Chand and Raj Kumar were never present at the spot together. The above discussion, therefore, goes to show about the petitioners having failed to prove the above issue and the same is accordingly decided against the petitioners. ISSUE No.2:- 14)Keeping in view my findings on issue no.1, the petitioners do not become entitled to any amount of compensation in the present case. Accordingly this issue is decided against the petitioners. ISSUE NO.3: 15)The onus of proving this issue was on the respondent no.3. The learned counsel for respondent no.3 did not press this issue in view of his arguments about the petition itself not being maintainable and the issue is decided against the respondent no.3. ISSUE NO. 4(RELIEF):- 16) Keeping in view of my detailed discussion on all the aforesaid issues, the petition deserves to be dismissed and accordingly, the Jagjit Singh, MACT Manju Rani etc. Vs.Harvinder Singh etc. 12 same is hereby dismissed. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly and file be consigned to record room after due compliance.

AWARD: The present claim petition, has been filed by Rambir Singh claimant, under section 166 of Motor Vehicles Act, thereby claiming compensation, on account of injuries and permanent disability sustained by him in motor vehicular accident, which took place on 10.07.2014 in front of IPS School GT Road, Mohra Distt. Ambala. 2The brief facts of the case are that on the fateful day i.e. on Rakesh Singh, MACT Rambir Singh Vs. Sukhwinder Singh etc. 2 10.07.2014 the claimant was coming to his house town i.e. village Dukheri from Ambala Cantt. along with his nephew Gopal after finishing their work as pillion rider on the motor cycle bearing registration number HR-01-AD-8849 which was being driven by one Gopal on his correct left hand side of the road in a moderate speed. When at about 2 p.m. they reached in front of IPS School GT Road Mohra, Distt. Ambala in the meantime a truck bearing registration number PB- 19F-0154 being driven by respondent no.1 was coming in a wrong side from opposite side in a rash and negligent manner in a very high speed and hit the motor cycle of the claimant from front wheel, as a result of which the claimant and his uncle fell down in right side and truck crossed after causing the accident to front wheel of motor cycle and right leg of the claimant. Respondent no.1 after causing the accident ran away from the spot leaving his truck there. Thereafter an ambulance of police came at the spot and took the claimant and got admitted him in KD Sharma Hospital, Ambala Cantt. Claimant later on found the name and address of the respondent no.1. The claimant received multiple grievous and simple injuries including compound fractures of (R) Tibia and Fibula and (L) Ankle Bimalleolar Fracture. He was operated upon and limb reconstruction system and internal fixation with screws and rush nail was also done. Due to the injuries suffered by him he is unable to do any work properly. It was further averred that he remained admitted in K.D.Hospital, Ambala Cantt. from 10.07.2014 to 22.07.2014 and spent about Rs.Three lacs on account of his medicines, operation, treatment,special diet, transportation,visitors Rakesh Singh, MACT Rambir Singh Vs. Sukhwinder Singh etc. 3 etc.and much more amount is likely to be spent on his treatment as outdoor patient. 3FIR No.187 dated 10.07.2014 u/ss 279,337,427 of IPC was registered by Police of police station Parao, Ambala Cantt. against the respondent no.1 on the statement of the claimant. 4It has been pleaded by the claimant that at the time of accident, he was working as agriculturist and was running milk dairy and was earning Rs.30,000/- per month but because of the injuries suffered by him he has become very weak and is unable to do any work properly. Claiming compensation of Rs.Ten lac it was pleaded that the accident has taken place due to the sole negligence of respondent no.1 and the vehicle in question was owned by respondent no.2 and respondent no.3 is the insurer of the vehicle in question. Hence, all the respondents are liable to pay the compensation jointly and severally. 5Notice of the petition was directed to be issued to the respondents who appeared through their counsels and filed their separate written statements. Respondents no.1 and 2 filed their joint written statement raising preliminary objections regarding maintainability and claim petition bad for non joinder of driver, owner and insurer of motor cycle bearing number HR01D-8849. On merits, the accident in question was denied. Even the involvement of vehicle i.e. Truck bearing registration number PB 19F- 0154 in this accident was denied. 6In the written statement filed by respondent no.3 preliminary Rakesh Singh, MACT Rambir Singh Vs. Sukhwinder Singh etc. 4 objections regarding maintainability,respondent no.1 was not having valid and effective driving licence, no accident as alleged had taken place with alleged truck bearing registration number PB-19F-0154 and collusion of claimant with respondents no.1 and 2 were raised. It was further pleaded that even if it is presumed though not admitted that any accident has taken place on the aforesaid date,even then the respondent no.3 is not liable to pay any compensation since the claimant suffered the alleged injuries due to sole rash and negligent driving of the motor cycle bearing registration number HR-01AD-8849 by its driver at a fast speed and abruptly taking turn without caring the rules and traffic on the road and skidding of his motorcycle due to uncontrollable speed as well.

Learned counsel for the parties have been heard. 11Issue wise findings are hereunder: ISSUE NO.1 : 12.In order to prove this issue petitioner has examined Gopal -eye witness who in his affidavit Ex.PW2/A has deposed that on 10.7.2014 he was coming to his home i.e. village Dukheri from Ambala Cantt. along with his uncle Rambir Singh (claimant) after finishing his work. He was driving the motorcycle bearing registration No.HR 01 AD 8849 on which claimant was sitting as pillion rider and the said motor cycle was being driven by him in a very moderate speed on correct left hand side of the road. At about 2 p.m.they reached in front of IPS School GT Road Mohra, Distt. Ambala, in the meantime a truck bearing registration number PB 19F-0154 being driven by respondent no.1 came from opposite side in a rash and negligent manner and hit his motor cycle from front wheel, as a result of which he and his uncle Rambir Singh fell down in right side and the front wheel of the truck crossed the front wheel of the motor cycle and right leg of the claimant Rambir Singh. He has further deposed that respondent no.1 after causing the accident ran way from the spot leaving his truck there. Thereafter an ambulance of police came at the spot and took the claimant and got admitted him in Rakesh Singh, MACT Rambir Singh Vs. Sukhwinder Singh etc. 7 K.D.Sharma Hospital, Ambala Cantt. He and claimant later on found the name and address of the respondent no.1 as Sukhwinder Singh. He has further deposed that FIR No.187dated 10.7.2014 under sections 279,338,427 of IPC was registered against respondent no.1 in police station Parao, Ambala Cantt. He has further deposed that in the accident claimant received multiple grievous, simple injuries including compound fractures. He was operated upon and Limb Reconstruction system and Internal fixation with screws and rush nail was also done. He has further deposed that claimant remained admitted in K.D.Sharma Hospital, Ambala Cantt. for sufficient period and spent a huge amount approximately Rs.Three lac on account of his medicines, operation, treatment, special diet, transportation, visitors etc. He has further deposed that the accident in question took place due to sole rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 being the driver of the offending vehicle and was witnessed by him. The offending vehicle was owned by respondent no.2 and was insured with respondent no.3. In the cross-examination he has deposed that the offending truck came from their opposite direction i.e. from wrong side and it was head on collision. It was day time and he had seen the said truck prior to the accident but before he could understand the accident took place. He further stated that he did not suffer any injury except scratch as he had fell down in a side and was not medicolegally examined in any hospital and he also did not take any treatment. He further deposed that he did not accompany his uncle to the hospital from the spot and went back to his Rakesh Singh, MACT Rambir Singh Vs. Sukhwinder Singh etc. 8 house. He denied the suggestion that no accident took place with the truck in question or that they falsely implicated the rightly parked truck in the present case in collusion with its owner and driver and in connivance with the local police just to get compensation from the insurance company. PW3 Rambir Singh also deposed on the similar lines as deposed by PW2 Gopal. PW1 Kewal Krishan- Criminal Ahlmad has brought the file case titled as State Vs. Sukhwinder, FIR No.187 dated 10.7.2014 under sections 279,338,427 of IPC registered at police station Parao. He has further deposed that charge against accused Sukhwinder Singh was framed on 18.10.2014 and he was arrested and was bailed out on 10.7.2014. The truck bearing registration number PB-19-F-0154 was released on superdari vide order dated 14.7.2014. In his cross-examination he has stated that no DL,RC, Route Permit is attached with the file. 13On the basis of the above said evidence it is evident that the petitioner while appearing as PW3 as well as eye witness Gopal while appearing as PW2 have specifically stated that the accident has taken place due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing registration number PB-19F-0154 being driven by respondent no.1. It is also evident from the statement of PW1 Kewal Krishan, Criminal Ahlmad that FIR No.187 dated 10.07.2014 was registered and in the said FIR the respondent no.1 is facing trial. It is well settled that a presumption is Rakesh Singh, MACT Rambir Singh Vs. Sukhwinder Singh etc. 9 raised when a person is facing trial. In this regard a reference can be made to case titled as Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Shyam and others 1993(2) Punjab Law Reporter 109. 14Thus,keeping in view the above said circumstances especially statements of PW2 Gopal and PW3 Rambir Singh and the evidence brought on record with regard to facing of trial under sections 279/338/427 of IPC by respondent no.1 in a criminal court, clearly goes to establish that accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 while driving truck bearing registration no. PB-19F-0154. Thus, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.4 15.Onus to prove this issue was on respondent-insurance company. This issue pertains on the question whether at the time of accident respondents no.1 who was allegedly driving the vehicle involved in the accident was having valid and effective driving licence or not. 16In order to escape from its liability,it is required for Insurance Company to prove violation of any terms and conditions of the policy on the part of insured i.e. respondent no.2. 17It has been alleged by the Insurance Company that respondent no.1 i.e. driver was not holding a valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident. 18The respondents no.1 and 2 have placed on record driving licence of respondent no.1 as Ex.R2 which is in the name of Sukhwinder Rakesh Singh, MACT Rambir Singh Vs. Sukhwinder Singh etc. 10 Singh - respondent no.1 which goes to show that the said licence was for driving M,CYCLE/LMV/HMV only. This licence has been issued by Licensing Authority,Ludhiana and is valid upto 17.11.2011. However, the accident had taken place in the year 2014. There is no record to show that it was ever renewed. Therefore, respondent no.3 cannot be held liable to pay the compensation. It is held that respondent no.1 was not having any licence on the date of accident and thus he has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. In view of this the issue no.4 is decided in favour of the claimant as well as respondent no.3 and against the respondents no.1 and 2. ISSUE NO.2: 19This issue pertains to the amount of compensation and by whom it is to be paid to the petitioner. In this regard the petitioner Rambir while appearing as PW3 has stated in his affidavit Ex.PW3/A that after the accident he remained admitted in K.D.Hospital, Ambala Cantt. from 10.7.2014 to 22.7.2014 where he was operated upon and Limb Reconstruction system and Internal fixation with screws and rush nail was done and he spent about Rs.Three lacs on account of medicines,operation, treatment,special diet, transportation, visitors etc. and more amount is likely to be spent on his treatment as outdoor patient. He has also placed on record medical bills with regards to his treatment Ex.P3 to Ex.P50,Ex.P53 and Ex.P59 to Ex.P62 . 20Counsel for the respondents no.1 and has submitted that there is no MLR and as such in the absence of MLR it cannot be held that Rakesh Singh, MACT Rambir Singh Vs. Sukhwinder Singh etc. 11 claimant got injuries in a road side accident. In support of his contentions he has placed reliance on case titled as Satpal Vs. Som Nath @ SOMI and others 2015(3) PLR 569 ( P & H). 21The above said contention cannot be accepted because in this case the injured was taken to private hospital and in the private hospital MLRs are not being prepared. However, the treatment given in K.D.Hospital is in conformity wherein it has been stated that he was taken directly to K.D. Hospital in an ambulance. 22Thus, a total sum of the expenses incurred on the treatment of petitioner including the medicines comes out to Rs.1,01,125/-. Further as per Ex.P52 he was assessed a disability to the extent of 10% and therefore, on account of this disability petitioner is entitled to Rs.2000x10=Rs.20,000/-. Further as he remained admitted in hospital from 10.7.2014 to 22.7.2014 as stated by him in his statement and this fact is also evident Ex.P51 case summary of Rambir Singh,therefore, he is entitled to Rs.20,000/ - for his twelve days admission in the hospital and for pain and sufferings. In addition to this he is also held entitled to Rs.5000/- on account of special diet etc. Thus, in total he is entitled to Rs.1,46,125/- which is rounded as Rs.1,46,200/-(Rs.One lac,Forty Six Thousand, Two hundred only). 23.The offending vehicle i.e. the truck bearing registration number PB-19F-0154 was insured with respondent no.3 in the name of respondent no.2 for the period w.e.f. 28.9.2013 to 27.9.2014. This period covers the date of accident. Since it is held in issue no.4 that respondent Rakesh Singh, MACT Rambir Singh Vs. Sukhwinder Singh etc. 12 no.1 was not holding a valid and effective driving licence and thus has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, as such insurance company is not liable to pay the compensation amount to the claimant. Resultantly, it is held that the respondents no.1 and 2 being the respective driver and owner of the offending vehicle are jointly and severally responsible to pay the compensation amount, as assessed by this Tribunal to the petitioners. Issue no.2 is decided accordingly in favour of the petitioner as well as in favour of respondent no.3 and against the respondents no.1 and 2. ISSUE NO.3 24In view of my findings on issues no.1 and 2 petition of the petitioner is very well maintainable. Hence this issue is decided in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.5(RELIEF): 25.In view of the findings on all the issues as above, the claim petition partly succeeds and is hereby allowed with costs in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents no.1 and 2. Compensation of Rs.1,46,200/-(Rs.One lac,Forty Six Thousand, Two hundred only) along with interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum from the date of institution of the petition till realization is awarded to the petitioner to be paid by respondents no.1 and 2 jointly and severally. 26In view of findings given in issues no.2 and 4 the respondent no.3 is not held entitled to pay any amount of compensation to the petitioner. Rakesh Singh, MACT Rambir Singh Vs. Sukhwinder Singh etc. 13 27.In order to facilitate the easy release of the amount to the petitioner, it is ordered that respondents no.1 and 2 will deposit the amount directly in the name of the petitioner, either by way of account payee cheque or demand draft in the Tribunal. The petitioner will submit the details of his bank account directly to the respondents no.1 and 2 under intimation to this tribunal and the cheque/ draft shall be released to the petitioner on an application for release of the same along with payment order in the name of concerned Manager with directions to disburse the amount as per Award and the details mentioned in payment order by Nazir, who shall submit a compliance report, which would be made part of the main file.

Shri D. V . Dhindsa, Counsel for the Respondents No. 1 & 2. Shri Rajiv Walia, Counsel for the respondent No.3. AWARD:- Claimant Deep Chand has brought the instant claim petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, for grant of compensation of Rs.20,00,000/- on account of injuries sustained by him in a Motor Vehicular accident, which was taken place on 18.02.2015 at Tirlokpur DEEP CHAND VS KIRAN PAL ETC 2 Road, near HM Factory, Kala Amb and FIR No.13 dated 18.02.2015 was registered at Police Station Kala Amb (HP). 2 The necessary first part of claim petition relating to accident are that on 18.02.2015, claimant in the company of Parveen Saini were coming on motorcycle bearing Registration No. HR-54-B-6363 towards their house. The claimant was riding the motorcycle and when they reached near gate of HM Factory, Kala Amb, at about 8.40 PM, then a truck bearing Registration No. HP-18-B-0253, came from Kala Amb side being driven by its driver i.e respondent No.1, in a rash and negligent manner, without observing traffic rules all of sudden turned his truck towards gate of HM Factory by coming wrong side of the road and hit against his motorcycle, as a result of that, he and Parveen Saini fell down along with the motorcycle and claimant received simple and grievous injuries and Parveen Saini Pillion rider also received simple injuries. The accident was occured due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing Registration No. HP-18-B-0253, by respondent No.1 Second part with regard to medical treatment and status of claimant are that after the accident, he was taken to Sneh Hospital, Kala Amb, where he was given first aid and on seeing his condition, he was taken to C. Lal Hospital Ambala Cantt, and thereafter, taken to N. P. Singh Hospital, Ambala City, where he remained admitted from 19.02.2015 to 27.02.2015 and was operated regarding his left foot. He has incurred more than Rs. One lac on his treatment and much more amount is needed for further treatment. The life of claimant has become hell. The marriage DEEP CHAND VS KIRAN PAL ETC 3 of the claimant was performed on 18.02.2014 and he is following medical treatment. Prior to accident, he was fit and healthy and his age is 26 years and is doing job of Supervisor in M/s M. K. Auto Clutch Co., Village Kheri, Tirlokpur Road, Kala Amb (HP) and getting salary of Rs.15,100/- per month. The offending vehicle is owned by respondent No.2 and is insured with respondent No.3, and as such all respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation to the claimant. Hence, this petition. 3Upon notice, respondent no.1 and 2 filed their written statement inter-alia with the preliminary objections qua maintainability and locus-standi. On merit, they submitted that neither any accident took place from vehicle bearing Registration No. H)-18-B-0253 and nor the same was driven by respondent No.1. and a false case under section 279/337/338 IPC was registered vide a false FIR No.13 dated 18.02.2015 against the respondent No.1. However, respondent No.1, was not involved in the said accident. Rest of contents are denied and prayed for dismissal the claim petition with costs. 4Respondent No.3 Insurance Company filed written statement by taking preliminary objections like locus-standi; that respondent No.1 was not having a valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident and was driving in violation of terms and conditions of the alleged insurance policy that too with the knowledge of its owner and also not having valid and effective insurance policy at the time of alleged accident; that if it is presumed, though not admitted, that the accident as DEEP CHAND VS KIRAN PAL ETC 4 alleged, had taken place on the aforesaid date, even then the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation since the alleged vehicle of the claimant suffered alleged damages due to its own rash and negligent driving by its driver as well as non awareness of traffic rules and without caring the traffic rules. On merit it is submitted that no accident, as alleged has taken place. However, a false and manipulated FIR was registered in connivance with the local police in collusion with the respondents No.1 and 2 after the alleged occurrence. It is incorrect that the claimant has spent Rs. One lac on the alleged treatment and operation and diet etc or he is still under treatment, as alleged. If it is presumed, though not admitted, that the accident as alleged, had taken place on the aforesaid date, even then, the answering respondent is not liable to pay any compensation since the vehicle was being driven by its driver in violation of terms and conditions of the insurance policy and prayed for dismissal the claim petition with heavy costs. 5Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed vide order dated 18.08.2015:- 1Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1 while driving Truck bearing registration No. HP-18-B-0253 resulting into causing injuries to claimant Deep Chand, as alleged ? OPP. 2If Issue No 1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom, the claimant is entitled to ? OPP. 3Whether petition is not maintainable in the present form ? OPR 4Whether petitioner has no locus standi to file the DEEP CHAND VS KIRAN PAL ETC 5 present petition ? OPR 5Whether respondent No.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect ? OPR 6Whether respondent No.3 is entitled to take all the defences available to it under the M. V . Act ? OPR 7Relief 6To substantiate the factum of claim through this enquiry, claimant examined PW1 Parveen Kumar {Pillion rider-eye witness of accident}, who tendered affidavit Ex.PW1/A supporting the stand of the claimant. He was cross-examined at length. PW2 Manoj Kumar , Accounts Department, M.K. Auto Clutch Company produced Authorization letter dated 05.10.2015 as Ex.P1, Salary certificate as Ex.P2, Copy of adult worker register as Ex.P3, attendance register for the year 2015 as Ex.P4, salary register for the Month of January and February 2015 as Ex.P5 and Ex.P6 which are correct as per record. He was cross-examined at length. PW3 Dr. Vikas Paul , Medical Officer, General Hospital, Ambala City stated that on 24.06.2015, Deep Chand appeared before the Board for disability assessment which was found to be 20 percent permanent on account of amputation left foot with loss of all toes. He has seen the original disability certificate issued by board of medical doctors on 24.06.2015. He identified his signatures on the disability certificate Ex.P7. He was cross-examined. PW4 Dr. N.P. Singh stated that Deep Chand was admitted in his hospital on 19.02.2015 after road side accident on 18.02.2015. He DEEP CHAND VS KIRAN PAL ETC 6 was firstly admitted at an Orthopaedic Hospital Ambala cantt and later shifted to his hospital on 19.02.2015. At the time of admission, he was fully conscious. He has produced detailed injuries as Ex.P8. The patient was remained admitted from 19.02.2015 to 27.02.2015 and he performed debridment of wound and suturing of plantar skin under spinal anesthesia. The left fore foot was amputated at I.P.Joint level at the time of injury. He has produced copy of admission and discharge card as Ex.P9. He has proved the original bill dated 27.02.2015 of Rs.26,500/- as Ex.P10 . The medicine expenses etc were borne by the patient himself. He was cross-examined. PW5 Dr. M. L. Gupta , Sneh Hosp[ital, Kala Amb produced injury record of claimant Deep Chand as Ex.P11. He also produced copy of certificate issued by him to the police as Mark-A, report as Mark-B in his evidence. He was cross-examined. PW6 Dr. Raj Pal Singh tendered his affidavit Ex.PW6/A and medical bills from Ex.P12 to Ex.P28 in his evidence. He was cross-examined. PW7 Claimant Deep Chand stepped into witness box as PW7 and tendered affidavit Ex.PW7/A reiterating the contents mentioned in the petition. He also produced medical bills EX.P29 to EX.P47,final report EX.P48 and Copy of FIR EX.P49 in evidence. In cross- examination, he answered that he started from his house at 7.00 AM for his job place. His job hours are generally 8.00 AM to 8.30 PM. His factory is about 500 meter away from HM Factory. There is no turn near the place of occurrence on both sides of the road. He saw the lights of DEEP CHAND VS KIRAN PAL ETC 7 alleged offending truck at a distance of 100 meters. He is working as supervisor at MK Auto Clutch. There is no speed breaker ahead and before HM Factory. Many workers of the factory gathered at the spot after the accident. It is correct that Parveen, pillion rider was not admitted in the hospital. He received only minor injuries. He was in senses, but not in full senses and Parveen had become unconscious. Public gathered at the spot shifted them to the hospital but he does not know their names. He does not know on which date his statement was recorded. He had visited the police station many times. It is incorrect to suggest that his motorcycle slipped due to his own rash and negligent driving or that he suffered injuries in that accident. The number of offending truck was not given by any one. It was seen by him. He cannot read English properly. The affidavit Ex.PW7/A was prepared by his counsel after discussion with him. Thereafter, learned counsel for the claimant closed the evidence. On the other hand, Learned counsel for respondents No.1 and 2 tendered copy of driving licence Mark-A, copy of cover note /policy as Mark-B and copy of RC as Mark-C, and closed their evidence. Learned counsel for respondent No.3, tendered copy of insurance policy as Ex.RW3/A in his evidence and same was closed by court order. In rebuttal evidence, learned counsel for claimant tendered medical bill of Rs.500/- as Mark P1, medicines bill of Rs.395/- as Mark P2, medicine bill of Rs.300/- as Mark-P3 and Medicine bill of Rs200/- as Mark-P4 and closed the same. 7I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone DEEP CHAND VS KIRAN PAL ETC 8 through the case file very carefully. My findings on issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1: 8 Under this issue, petitioner- claimant is required to prove the fact that accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1, while driving Truck bearing registration No. HP-18-B- 0253 resulting into causing injuries to claimant Deep Chand and as such he is entitled to appropriate compensation from respondents. 9 Learned counsel for the petitioner-claimant has argued that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of truck driver bearing No. HP-18-B-0253, by respondent No.1 and FIR EX.P49 in this regard was lodged. He further argued that respondent No.1 has been facing trial according to final report EX.P48 before trial court. He further submitted that statement of PW1{pillion rider} is corroborated with statement of PW7 injured, which establish the factum of involvement of offending vehicle in the motor vehicular accident, therefore, respondent No.1, driver, respondent No.2 owner, and respondent No.3, insurer of vehicle in question, are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioner. 10 On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent no.1 and 2 has argued that though respondent No.1 has been facing trial, but has been implicated in criminal case. He further argued that respondent No.2 has not breached any terms and conditions of the insurance policy EX.RW3/A and prayed for dismissal the claim petition qua respondents No.1 and 2. DEEP CHAND VS KIRAN PAL ETC 9 11On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent No.3 has vehemently argued that respondent no.1 was not holding valid D/L, therefore in view of fact, no liabilities can be fastened upon respondent no.3 to indemnify the claim as respondent No.2 has breached the terms and conditions of insurance policy and prayed for dismissal the petition. 12I have given due regard to the rival contentions put forth by learned counsel for respective parties and have evaluated the entire oral evidence coupled with documentary evidence carefully. After thorough examination, it is observed that the petitioner-claimant has come to this Tribunal with categorical stand that the accident was taken place due to rash and negligent driving of truck driver bearing No. HP-18-B-0253, by respondent No.1, and FIR EX.P49 was registered against respondent No.1. In that accident, claimant sustained multiple injuries including 20 percent permanent disability as per certificate EX.P7. In order to prove factum of accident, PW7 {claimant-injured} deposed on similar line according to contents mentioned in the petition. Further his statement is corroborated by PW1 pillion rider. Although, PW1& PW2 were cross- examined, but nothing adverse can be extracted disbelieving the factual position of motor vehicular accident. There is sufficient evidence to establish factum of accident as FIR EX.P48 was registered against respondent No.1, who has been facing trial under section 279, 337 & 338 of IPC according to final report prepared under section 173 CRPC as EX.P49 on file and so contention of opposite counsel can not be accepted being devoid of merits. DEEP CHAND VS KIRAN PAL ETC 10 13 I t is quite well settled that Each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The Tribunal has to decide the case on the basis of evidence available on file without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled preposition of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. It must be remembered that in a criminal case, prosecution is required to prove its case beyond shadow of reasonable doubt. However, in a motor accident claim, the claimant is not required to prove the case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. The claimant is required to establish that the accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts on the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way alleged by the claimant. The provisions regarding claim under the Act are enacted by keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimant is always entitled for compensation irrespective whether the police has registered the offence regarding the incident or not because no claim case can be left over on the mercy of the police. 14 It may not be out of place to mention here that respondent no.1, did not come in the witness box to rebut the version of petitioner- claimant. In this way, it can be easily said that petitioner-claimant received multiple injuries in the motor vehicular accident due to rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1, who has been facing trial. In DEEP CHAND VS KIRAN PAL ETC 11 view of law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993(2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008(2) R.C.R. (civil) 774, this Tribunal is of the considered opinion that there is cogent and clinching evidence on file to reach the formidable conclusion that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. Accordingly, issued no.1 is decided in favour of petitioner-claimant. ISSUE NO.2: 15 Under this issue, claimant is required to establish computation of compensation and if any, with whom the amount shall be recovered. According to statement of PW4 Dr. N.P. Singh, it can be gathered that claimant was remained admitted from 19.02.2015 to 27.02.2015 and PW4 performed debridment of wound and suturing of plantar skin under spinal anesthesia. The left fore foot was amputated at I.P. Joint level at the time of injury. He proved admission and discharge card as Ex.P9. He also proved the original bill dated 27.02.2015 of Rs.26,500/- as Ex.P10 . PW6 Dr. Raj Pal Singh tendered affidavit Ex.PW6/A and proved medical bills Ex.P12 to Ex.P28 showing total expenses of Rs.28,600/-. Further, Claimant has also produced medical bills EX.P29 to EX.49 showing expenses of Rs.23,454/- {in round figure 23500/-} Additionally, he must have spent some amount on rich diet, attendants, transportation, visitors, follow up treatment etc. In Nizam Institute of Medical Sciences versus Prasanth S.Dhananka, 2010 ACJ 38 (SC), by the three-Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Apex Court, it was observed that sympathy for the victim does not, and should not, come in DEEP CHAND VS KIRAN PAL ETC 12 the way of making a correct assessment, but if a case is made out, the Court must not be chary of awarding adequate compensation. It was further observed that the case of an injured and disabled person is, however, more pitiable and the feeling of hurt, helplessness, despair and often destitution ensues every day. The support that is needed by a severely handicapped person comes at an enormous price, physical, financial and emotional, not only on the victim but even more so on his family and attendants and the stress saps their energy and destroys their equanimity. In Arvind Kumar Mishra versus New India Assurance Company Limited, 2010 ACJ 2867 (SC); i t was observed that the whole idea is put the claimant in the same position as he was insofar as money concerned and Perfect compensation is hardly possible but one has to keep in mind that the victim has done no wrong; he has suffered at the hands of the wrongdoer and the Court must take care to give him full and fair compensation for what he had suffered. 16 It is further made clear that he received physical permanent disability to the extent of 20 percent as per disability certificate Ex.P7. In view of extent of physical disability and its nature when examined in the light of Judgment in Ram Kiran Goyal vs Sub Divisional engineer, mechanical and other 2008{2} RCR {Civil} 103 , claimant is entitled to Rs.40,000/- @ 2000/- per percent. 17 In view of overall facts and circumstances arising out in this petition, this Tribunal finds justification in assessing compensation according to injuries attributed to claimant as per settled preposition of DEEP CHAND VS KIRAN PAL ETC 13 law in Raj Kumar Vs Ajay Kumar, (2011)1 SCC 343 , the petitioner- claimant is held entitled to the following compensation: Pecuniary damages (Special damages) 20% permanent disability; Rs. 40000/- (i).Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization, medicines, transportation, nourishing food, and miscellaneous expenditure.Rs.78600 /-plus {1000/- per day as indoor patient} Rs-8000/- including all expenses. (ii).Loss of earnings (and other gains) which the injured would have made had he not been injured, comprising: (a) Loss of earning during the period of treatment; (b) Loss of future earning on account of injuries etc. 5000/- nil (iii). Future medical expenses. 5000 - None-pecuniary damages (General damages) (iv). Damages for pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the injuries. 5000/- (v). Loss of amenities (and/or loss of prospects of marriage). nil (vi).Loss of expectation of life ( shortening of normal longevity). nil /- Total Compensation Rs.1,41,600/- 18 In view of law laid down in case New India Assurance company limited versus Charlie and another, 2005 (2) Recent Civil Reports 550 , the petitioner is also entitled to interest @ 7.5% per annum on the total awarded compensation from the date of filing of petition till realization of awarded amount. The computation of compensation is just, equitable, fair and reasonable. Remaining relief sought by petitioner- claimant stand declined. The question of liability to pay compensation DEEP CHAND VS KIRAN PAL ETC 14 amount shall be decided under issue no.5 below. Accordingly, Issue no.2 is decided in the above stated terms, in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents. ISSUE NO. 3, 4 & 6 : 19 The onus to prove these issues are upon Respondents, but they neither pressed these issues nor led any evidence. Further it has been discussed in detail under issue no.1, that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 and thus it can not be said that no accident was taken place with offending vehicle or the instant claim petition is not maintainable etc. In this way, it has become obvious for this tribunal that respondents failed to prove these issues and as such this tribunal has left with no other option except to decide the same against Respondents. Accordingly, these issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.5: 20 The onus to prove this issue is upon the respondent No.3, who is under the obligation to prove this fact that the respondent No.1 was not holding a valid driving licence at the day of alleged accident and as such respondent no.1 & 2 have violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy/cover note EX.R3/A and so respondent No.3 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimant. However, it is apparent on the face of record that respondent no.1&2 have produced D/L as Mark-A, RC Mark-C, cover note as Mark-C, whereby, it may presume that respondent No.1 was holding valid driving license at the day of accident. DEEP CHAND VS KIRAN PAL ETC 15 The fitness certificate Mark-D make it clear that offending vehicle was fit to ply on road. Needless to state that, Insurance Policy Ex.RW3/A reveals that offending vehicle was insured with the respondent No.3 at the relevant time. In the fact and circumstances, respondents are held jointly and severally liable to pay the awarded compensation to claimant and respondent no.3 shall indemnify the insured. Accordingly, this Issue is decided against the respondent No.3. ISSUE NO.7 (RELIEF): PETITION SUCCEED S 21 In view of the foregoing discussion, instant claim petition stands allowed with costs in a manner that the claimant-petitioner is entitled to compensation of Rs.1,41,600/- along with interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition till the date of actual payment. The awarded amount along with the interest shall be payable jointly and severally by Respondents and respondent no.3 shall indemnify the insured respectively. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.3000/-. Memo of costs be prepared accordingly. After due compliance, file be consigned to records. Announced in open Court. (Dr. Sanjeev Arya) Dated:10.02.2016 Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, (I.B) Ambala.

On merits, it is submitted that in fact, accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving Tipper/Dumper in question rashly and negligently at fast speed and that answering respondent was driving the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 32 Bus in question at normal speed on correct side of the road.

It is further submitted that petition has been filed after due consultation just to get compensation from answering respondent Denying all other averments, dismissal of petition was prayed for. 18.Though separate written statements were filed by respondents in each connected claim petition, yet same stand, as taken in main MACP no.208 of 2015 titled as Aman Sharma versus Rohit Kumar and others, has been taken. 19.Replication was not filed. From pleadings of parties, following issues were framed: 1.Whether the accident in question took place by rash and negligent driving of Tipper/Dumper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635 by respondent no.1 Rohit Kumar resulting into injuries to Aman Sharma, Ajay Kumar, Pritam Singh, Yogesh, Pawan, Vivek and Amit Saini and death of Deepak Sharma, Parminder Singh, Aamir Furqan and Manish Kumar, as alleged? OPP AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 34 2If Issue no.1 is proved, then whether the claimants are entitled to compensation, if so, how much and from whom? OPP 3Whether respondent no.1 was driving offending vehicle in violation of terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy, if so, its effect? OPR (3) 4Relief 20.Petitioners, in order to prove their case, examined as many as thirteen witnesses: PW1 Harpreet Kaur PW2 Manju PW3 Aliya Khatun PW4 Pritam Singh PW5 Amit Saini PW6 Aman Sharma PW7 Alka Sharma PW8 Ajay Kumar PW9 Yogesh PW10 Pawan Kumar PW11 Dr. Vikas Paul PW12 Vivek Sharma PW13 Amarjeet In documentary evidence, documents Ex.P37 to 178 were tendered. AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 35 21.On the other hand, respondents examined RW1 Rohit Kumar/respondent no.1. In documentary evidence, documents Ex.R1 to Ex.R11 were tendered. 22.No rebuttal evidence was led. 23.After due consideration of the arguments and evidence of both parties, the findings on the above issues along with reasons for the decision are given below:- ISSUE NO.1: 24.Burden to prove this issue was upon claimants. Ld. counsel for claimants submitted that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving vehicle no.HR37C/8635 in a rash and negligent manner. Ld. counsel relied upon the statements of PW4 to PW6, PW8 to PW10 and PW12 and copy of Challan Ex.P37 and copy of charge-sheet dated 30.07.2015 Ex.P38. and submitted that respondent no.1 was responsible for causing the accident as he was driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. 25.On the other hand, ld. counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 submitted that PW10 Pawan Kumar was driving Bus no.HR68A/2180 in a rash and negligent manner and he could have avoided the accident if he had control over his Bus as he dashed his bus against the Dumper/Tipper, which had turned turtle on the road. Ld. counsel further submitted that last control was in hands of PW10 and had he been driving his bus at moderate speed, the accident could have been avoided. 26.Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 Shri Mohinder Bindal AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 36 Advocate supported the arguments raised by ld. counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 and submitted that even if it is taken that respondent no.1 was not driving Dumper/Tipper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635 at moderate speed and so the Dumper turned turtle in middle of the road, even then the accident could have been avoided by PW10 Pawan Kumar by applying brakes, but he could not control his bus as he was driving in a rash and negligent manner and at high speed and his bus dashed against the Dumper/Tipper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635. Ld. counsel further submitted that all injured witnesses have wrongly deposed that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and these witnesses can not be believed as they have wrongly deposed the facts only in order to support the case of College authorities and to support PW10, so that College be not held liable to pay compensation. Ld. counsel further submitted that PW10 Pawan Kumar appeared as PW16 in criminal case titled as State versus Rohit and admitted that driver of the Tipper/Dumper had not received any injury in the accident and driver side of said Tipper was not damaged, so entire version of claimants and PW10 that it was head-on-collision between Bus and truck, is not believable. Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 further submitted that even if it is taken that respondent no.1 was also responsible for the accident, even then this case is of contributory negligence. 27. Ld. counsel for respondents no.4 to 6 supported the case of claimants and submitted that only respondent no.1 was responsible for the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 37 accident as he was driving vehicle no.HR37C/8653 in a rash and negligent manner. Ld. counsel further submitted that there is no evidence on record, from which it can be held that it is a case of contributory negligence and Pawan Kumar driver was also responsible for causing the accident. 28.I have given anxious consideration to the arguments raised by ld. counsel for the parties and have perused record of the case. 29.In this case, thirteen (13) witnesses have been examined on behalf of petitioners and respondent no.1 Rohit appeared as RW1. Statements of PW1 to PW3, PW7, PW11 and PW13 are not relevant for decision of Issue no.1. 30.This Tribunal is of the view that once drivers of both vehicles have appeared in the witness box i.e. Pawan Kumar/respondent no.4 as PW10 and Rohit Kumar/respondent no.1 as RW1, then statements of other injured witnesses are not so relevant as the drivers would be the best witnesses to make statement about manner, in which accident occurred. Otherwise also, there are vital contradictions om material points in statements of other eye-witness/injured witnesses i.e. PW4 to PW7, PW8, PW9 and PW12. 31.Pawan Kumar/respondent no.4 was driving College Bus bearing registration no.HR68A/2180 on the date of accident and he appeared as PW10. He filed affidavit Ex.PW10/A, wherein he deposed about the accident to the effect that on 31.3.2015, he alongwith students and staff was going from Ambala Cantt. to SDDI Global College and AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 38 SRM Institute of Technology at village Bhurewala, while driving College Bus no.HR68A/2180 at moderate speed on left side of the road and around 7.30/8.00 AM when reached in the area of village Rajpura on Saha Road, offending Dumper/Tipper no.HR37C/8635 being driven by respondent no.1 at very fast speed and in rash and negligent manner, came from opposite side and upon this he lowered down the speed of his Bus and came on extreme left side of the road, but said Dumper came on wrong side of the road and struck against the Bus, resultantly, all passengers in the Bus received multiple and grievous injuries. He further deposed that due to this accident, Aamir Furqan, Vipin wife of Sahil, Parminder Singh, Manish Kumar, Kesar Singh, Ankit Gupta and Deepak Sharma died at the spot. In his cross-examination, he admitted that driver side of Tipper struck against driver side of his Bus and sand/soil entered the Bus from front wind screen as both winds screens of the Bus had broken. So PW10 has admitted in his cross-examination that both wind screens of his Bus had broken and soil/sand came inside the bus. 32.Pawan Kumar (appeared as PW10 in this case), who was driving the Bus in question, appeared as PW16 in criminal case titled as 'State versus Rohit' pertaining to FIR no.41 dated 31.3.2014 registered for commission of offences punishable u/Ss.279, 337, 338, 304 IPC in Police Station Shahzadpur in regard to the accident in question and in his statement dated 16.2.2016 Ex.P41, he deposed that soil of the Tipper entered the Bus when Bus came in contact with the Tipper and stated that AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 39 it was a head-on-collision. He admitted that photographs attached with the file are the same photographs, which were taken after the accident. He further admitted that driver of the Tipper had not received any injury in said accident and driver side of the Tipper had not damaged in the accident. 33.The statement of RW1 is most relevant and he deposed that on 31.3.2015, he was driving Tipper no.HR37C/8635 on correct side of the road at moderate speed and when reached T-point Rajpura, a tractor trolley came on the road and took sudden turn from the T-point, on which he applied sudden brakes, due to which his Tipper turned sideways and when it was lying on the road, the College Bus no.HR68A/2180 came from opposite side rashly and negligently at high speed and dashed against the Tipper from back side, resultantly, the mud lying in the goods wagon of the Tipper entered the Bus from its windscreen and front windows, as a result thereof the mishap took place. 34.It is clear from statement of RW1 that he had not received any injury in said accident. In his cross-examination he deposed that driver of the Bus was driving his Bus in a rash and negligent manner at high speed and could not control his Bus on seeing the over-turned Tipper. He further deposed that said accident could have been avoided by bus driver, if he had controlled the same. It is admitted fact that respondent no.1 had not suffered any injury and it is not the case of claimants or respondent no.4 that any other occupant of the Tipper had suffered injuries in the accident. AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 40 35.PW5 Amit Saini filed his affidavit Ex.PW5/A and in his cross-examination deposed that driver side of the Bus struck against the conductor side of the truck and both drivers suffered injuries. However his statement is totally contradictory to statements of other witnesses and against record. It is matter of record that driver of Tipper had not suffered any injury. It is also very relevant to mention here that while appearing as PW11 in criminal case, PW Amit Saini deposed that there was T-point at the place of accident and Tipper was carrying mud. He further deposed that mud of the Tipper pumped in the Bus, when Bus came in contact with the Tipper and due to entering of mud, there occurred suffocation and many persons died. 36.PW12 Vivek Sharma deposed that accident occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Tipper driver and police had recorded his statement, wherein he had made same statement regarding cause of accident. But while appearing as PW15 in criminal case titled as State versus Rohit, Vivek Sharma deposed that he does not know as to how said accident occurred. He deposed that he had not made any statement to police. He denied the suggestion that said Tipper was being driven in a rash and negligent manner. He further denied the suggestion that said accident occurred due to negligence of accused. Considering above facts, this Tribunal is of the view that PW12 is not a reliable witness as he has changed his stand from one Court to other. 37.PW8 Ajay Kumar (in present case) appeared as PW10 in criminal case and deposed that he had not seen the driver of Tipper at the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 41 spot. He deposed that only left side of the Tipper was damaged. This Tribunal is of the view that he is not a reliable witness and can not be believed on the point of cause of accident, as being employee of the College, his interest is to avoid liability of the College. While appearing as PW8, he deposed that he was sitting on front seat i.e. conductor seat of the Bus. If he is believed, then version of respondent no.1 is also true that Bus dashed against the Tipper when same had already turned turtle on the road and so PW8 Ajay Kumar has rightly deposed before other Court that he had not seen driver of the Tipper at the spot. 38.It is matter of record that most of the other injured persons, who were travelling in the Bus on that day, while appearing as witnesses in the criminal case titled as State versus Rohit Kumar, admitted that there was curve near the place of occurrence and when driver of Tipper applied brakes, the Tipper turned turtle on the road and they deposed that can not identify driver of the Tipper. They admitted that Bus had entered the mud of the Tipper. 39.After considering the statement dated 16.2.2016 Ex.P41 of Pawan Kumar, this Tribunal is of the view that version of PW10 Pawan Kumar is not believable, as had it been a case of head-on-collision, the driver side of the Tipper would have damaged totally as impact of the accident was such that many persons travelling in the Bus died and other occupants of the Bus suffered grievous injuries. The case file of criminal case titled as “State versus Rohit” was also summoned at the time of arguments in this case and photographs of Tipper bearing registration AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 42 no.HR37C/8635 are on that judicial file, from which it is apparent that driver side of the Tipper even did not hit the Bus and so version of claimants specifically PW10 (driver of bus) regarding head-on-collision is totally false. The photographs on record of criminal case file speak otherwise and substantiate the arguments raised by ld. counsel for respondents no.1 to 3. 40.Sudden crossing of the road by a human being or a child; sudden presence of a stray animal on the road; bursting of tyre due to some alien sharp edge article lying on the road; sudden collapse of the bridge; fall of electric wires; tornado; storm; flush of rain water from cloud burst, etc. are a few illustrative circumstances in which driver of a vehicle can possibly lose control. In any such like sudden events, the drive would try to control the vehicle and may apply sudden brakes, which, instead of stopping the vehicle, may over turn it or cause slip thereby the vehicle might go out of the driver's control. Such kind of accident, happening of which is beyond the control of a driver, may be termed as an “act of God”. However, where the vehicle was in sound roadworthy condition and was driven with an ordinary care, it shall always be expected that it will not go out of control of the driver, yet if any such thing happens, heavy onus shall lie upon either the driver or the owner of the vehicle to divulge that special knowledge of the relevant facts to explain as to why and how the vehicle went out of control of the driver. In the absence of any such explanation, the maxim ' res ipsa loquitur' would undoubtedly be attracted, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 43 Court in Krishna Bus Service Ltd. vs. Smt. Mangli and others AIR 1976 SC 700. 41.The site plan prepared by police after the accident is on record as Ex.P40, from which it is clear that there was a curve near the place of accident and so the version of RW1 Rohit Kumar is believable that in order to avoid the accident with tractor, he had applied brakes and the tractor turned turtle. However, considering the fact that he was also driving at very high speed and that had he been driving at moderate speed, he could have controlled the vehicle. The principle of res ipsa loquitur applies to this case and it can be safely concluded that respondent no.4 was also responsible and had contributed in causing the accident. It is a clear cut case of contributory negligence. From photographs on record, it is apparent that the sand/soil entered the Bus up to about six feet from front of the Bus and it speaks about the speed, at which respondent no.1 was driving the Bus. 42.The claimants and their witnesses had tried their best to prove that it was head-on-collision and respondent no.1 was responsible for the accident. However after perusing entire record and statements of witnesses in criminal case titled as 'State versus Rohit', it is clear that there was a curve near the place of accident and somehow on applying brakes, the Tipper turned turtle on the road, which shows that respondent no.1 was driving the Tipper at high speed and had he been driving at moderate speed, he could have controlled his vehicle, but failed to do so. But on the other hand, it is also clear that respondent no.4 Pawan Kumar AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 44 was driving the Bus at such a high speed that mud loaded in the Tipper entered the Bus, as clear from admissions made by the witnesses and photographs clicked after the accident, which are on record of criminal case file. The quantity of sand/soil entered the Bus was so much that the occupants of the Bus felt suffocated and this suffocation was also the result of some deaths. Had respondent no.4 been driving the College Bus at moderate speed and in a careful manner, even if the Tipper had turned turtle in front of the Bus, the accident could have been avoided. So this can be safely concluded that respondent no.4 Pawan Kumar, driver of the Bus, was also responsible in causing of the accident and so accident was the result of negligence on the part of respondent no.1 (Rohit Kumar) and respondent no.4 (Pawan Kumar) and it is a case of contributory negligence. Both drivers were equally responsible for the accident. 43.After considering the entire evidence on record, it is held that claimed have successfully proved that Aman Sharma, Ajay Kumar, Pritam Singh, Yogesh, Pawan, Vivek and Amit Saini had suffered injuries in the accident in dispute and Deepak Sharma, Parminder Singh, Aamir Furqan and Manish Kumar died due to the injuries suffered in the accident in question. 44.After considering entire evidence on record and keeping in view the above discussion, it is held that accident was not the result of rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 only, but respondent no.4 had also contributed in causing of the accident and both drivers were equally responsible in causing the accident on that day. It is a case of AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 45 contributory negligence. Issue no.1 is decided accordingly. ISSUE NO.2: MACP No.208 of 2015 Aman Sharma vs. Rohit & others 45.In this petition, compensation has been claimed by claimant on account of injuries suffered by her. In the petition, claimant has claimed compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the accident. It has been pleaded that claimant suffered multiple, serious and grievous injuries including multiple fractures in right ankle and foot and that after the accident, she was shifted to Civil Hospital Ambala Cantt. She pleaded that she remained under treatment of private doctors and remained admitted as an indoor patient for many days and spent Rs.1,00,000/- on her treatment, transportation and special diet. 46.Claimant Aman Sharma appeared as PW6 and filed her affidavit Ex.PW6/A, wherein she reiterated the contents of petition regarding suffering of injuries, fractures suffered and shifting to Civil Hospital. She deposed that she spent Rs.1,00,000/- on treatment, medicines, instruments, transportation and special diet. She further deposed that she was 24 years of age and was employed as Lab Technician in Electronics and Communication Branch, S.D.D.I. Global College, village Bhurewala, District Ambala and was getting Rs.7,000/- per month. She further deposed that after said accident, she is not in a position to perform her daily routine and has become permanently disabled and is still under treatment. In cross examination, she deposed AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 46 that she has not brought any proof regarding injuries suffered by her, treatment, medical expenses and her income. 47.To substantiate her claim regarding her disability and injuries suffered in the accident, she has placed on record MLR Ex.P43 and Disability Certificate, issued by Medical Board of three doctors of General Hospital, Ambala City, as Ex.P44. From the MLR Ex.P43, it is clear that she suffered one injury i.e. on leg below knee joint. Due to fracture, she was operated upon and due to the injuries suffered, she suffered permanent disability. As per Disability Certificate Ex.P44, petitioner suffered disability to the extent of 5%. In view of the fact that she suffered permanent disability to the extent of 5%, Rs.10,000/- is awarded under the head of permanent disability. 48.Neither prescription slips nor any Bill showing purchase of medicines has been placed on record by the claimant to substantiate her claim regarding amount spent on treatment. Considering the nature of injuries suffered by petitioner and facts of the case, Rs.30,000/- is awarded in lump sum under the head of pain and suffering, special diet, transportation, attendant charges and loss of income. So, in total, Rs.40,000/- is awarded to claimant as compensation in this case. MACP No.209 of 2015 Manju vs. Rohit & others 49.This claim petition has been filed by petitioners claiming compensation on account of death of Deepak Sharma in the accident in question. Manju, mother of Deepak Sharma (now deceased) appeared as AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 47 PW2 and filed her affidavit Ex.PW2/A, wherein she deposed that her son Deepak Sharma was 27 years of age at the time of his death and was hale and hearty. She further deposed that he was employed as Lecturer of Mechanical Engineering in SRM College, village Bhurewala, District Ambala with management of Shree Ram Mulkh Institute of Engineering and Technology, village Bhurewala, District Ambala and was getting salary of Rs.25,000/- per month and was also taking tuition, thereby earning Rs.10,000/- per month. She further deposed that Rs.One lac was spent on transportation and last rites of deceased. She further deposed that the deceased being their only son, they suffered great loss of love and affection on account of his untimely death. 50.PW13 Amarjit appeared with record regarding employment and salary of deceased Deepak Sharma. He deposed that Deepak Sharma was working in Maha Prabhu Ram Mulkh HI-Tech Education Society as Lecturer at salary of Rs.21,600/- per month. He proved Salary Certificate Ex.P7, Appointment letter Ex.P8, Joining letter Ex.P9 and Attendance Register Ex.P10. In cross-examination, he deposed that as per Ex.P9, he joined as Lecturer Mechanical. 51.No evidence has been lead to probe income from any other source viz tuition etc. From the statement of PW13, it is clear that Deepak Sharma was not a regular employee and was only a Guest Lecturer against salary of Rs.21,600/- per month. Accordingly, his income is assessed as Rs.21,600/- per month. In this petition, claimants are parents of deceased. In this petition, claimants are parents of deceased Deepak Sharma. The AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 48 deceased was unmarried son of claimants and so half of monthly income assessed is to be deducted towards personal expenses of deceased. Accordingly, loss of dependency comes to Rs.10,800/- per month and Rs.1,29,600/- per annum. 52.In view of the law laid down in the case of Munna Lal Jain v. Vipin Kumar Sharma, 2015 AIR SCW 3105, age of the deceased is relevant for selection of multiplier, which is to be used while assessing compensation on account where parents are the claimants. On applying multiplier of '17', amount of compensation to be awarded under the head of loss of dependency comes to Rs.22,03,200/-. Rs.1,00,000/- each is awarded in favour of claimants under the head of loss of love and affection and Rs.25,000/- is awarded under the head of last rites. Accordingly, total compensation of Rs.24,28,200/- is awarded in favour of petitioners. The petitioners will get equal share out of the compensation awarded in this case.

It is further submitted that no alleged accident had occurred AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 30 and a false FIR has been got lodged in connivance with police. On merits, it is submitted that in fact, on the fateful day, respondent no.1 was driving his vehicle on correct side of the road with limited speed and when reached Rajpura T-Point, a tractor trolley suddenly took a turn from the T-Point and came on the road and on seeing the same, respondent no.1 applied brakes in order to save the tractor trolley, but his tipper turned turtle, which was lifted later by crane.

On merits, it is submitted that in fact, accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving Tipper/Dumper in question rashly and negligently at fast speed and that answering respondent was driving the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 32 Bus in question at normal speed on correct side of the road.

It is further submitted that petition has been filed after due consultation just to get compensation from answering respondent Denying all other averments, dismissal of petition was prayed for. 18.Though separate written statements were filed by respondents in each connected claim petition, yet same stand, as taken in main MACP no.208 of 2015 titled as Aman Sharma versus Rohit Kumar and others, has been taken. 19.Replication was not filed. From pleadings of parties, following issues were framed: 1.Whether the accident in question took place by rash and negligent driving of Tipper/Dumper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635 by respondent no.1 Rohit Kumar resulting into injuries to Aman Sharma, Ajay Kumar, Pritam Singh, Yogesh, Pawan, Vivek and Amit Saini and death of Deepak Sharma, Parminder Singh, Aamir Furqan and Manish Kumar, as alleged? OPP AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 34 2If Issue no.1 is proved, then whether the claimants are entitled to compensation, if so, how much and from whom? OPP 3Whether respondent no.1 was driving offending vehicle in violation of terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy, if so, its effect? OPR (3) 4Relief 20.Petitioners, in order to prove their case, examined as many as thirteen witnesses: PW1 Harpreet Kaur PW2 Manju PW3 Aliya Khatun PW4 Pritam Singh PW5 Amit Saini PW6 Aman Sharma PW7 Alka Sharma PW8 Ajay Kumar PW9 Yogesh PW10 Pawan Kumar PW11 Dr. Vikas Paul PW12 Vivek Sharma PW13 Amarjeet In documentary evidence, documents Ex.P37 to 178 were tendered. AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 35 21.On the other hand, respondents examined RW1 Rohit Kumar/respondent no.1. In documentary evidence, documents Ex.R1 to Ex.R11 were tendered. 22.No rebuttal evidence was led. 23.After due consideration of the arguments and evidence of both parties, the findings on the above issues along with reasons for the decision are given below:- ISSUE NO.1: 24.Burden to prove this issue was upon claimants. Ld. counsel for claimants submitted that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving vehicle no.HR37C/8635 in a rash and negligent manner. Ld. counsel relied upon the statements of PW4 to PW6, PW8 to PW10 and PW12 and copy of Challan Ex.P37 and copy of charge-sheet dated 30.07.2015 Ex.P38. and submitted that respondent no.1 was responsible for causing the accident as he was driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. 25.On the other hand, ld. counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 submitted that PW10 Pawan Kumar was driving Bus no.HR68A/2180 in a rash and negligent manner and he could have avoided the accident if he had control over his Bus as he dashed his bus against the Dumper/Tipper, which had turned turtle on the road. Ld. counsel further submitted that last control was in hands of PW10 and had he been driving his bus at moderate speed, the accident could have been avoided. 26.Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 Shri Mohinder Bindal AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 36 Advocate supported the arguments raised by ld. counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 and submitted that even if it is taken that respondent no.1 was not driving Dumper/Tipper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635 at moderate speed and so the Dumper turned turtle in middle of the road, even then the accident could have been avoided by PW10 Pawan Kumar by applying brakes, but he could not control his bus as he was driving in a rash and negligent manner and at high speed and his bus dashed against the Dumper/Tipper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635. Ld. counsel further submitted that all injured witnesses have wrongly deposed that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and these witnesses can not be believed as they have wrongly deposed the facts only in order to support the case of College authorities and to support PW10, so that College be not held liable to pay compensation. Ld. counsel further submitted that PW10 Pawan Kumar appeared as PW16 in criminal case titled as State versus Rohit and admitted that driver of the Tipper/Dumper had not received any injury in the accident and driver side of said Tipper was not damaged, so entire version of claimants and PW10 that it was head-on-collision between Bus and truck, is not believable. Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 further submitted that even if it is taken that respondent no.1 was also responsible for the accident, even then this case is of contributory negligence. 27. Ld. counsel for respondents no.4 to 6 supported the case of claimants and submitted that only respondent no.1 was responsible for the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 37 accident as he was driving vehicle no.HR37C/8653 in a rash and negligent manner. Ld. counsel further submitted that there is no evidence on record, from which it can be held that it is a case of contributory negligence and Pawan Kumar driver was also responsible for causing the accident. 28.I have given anxious consideration to the arguments raised by ld. counsel for the parties and have perused record of the case. 29.In this case, thirteen (13) witnesses have been examined on behalf of petitioners and respondent no.1 Rohit appeared as RW1. Statements of PW1 to PW3, PW7, PW11 and PW13 are not relevant for decision of Issue no.1. 30.This Tribunal is of the view that once drivers of both vehicles have appeared in the witness box i.e. Pawan Kumar/respondent no.4 as PW10 and Rohit Kumar/respondent no.1 as RW1, then statements of other injured witnesses are not so relevant as the drivers would be the best witnesses to make statement about manner, in which accident occurred. Otherwise also, there are vital contradictions om material points in statements of other eye-witness/injured witnesses i.e. PW4 to PW7, PW8, PW9 and PW12. 31.Pawan Kumar/respondent no.4 was driving College Bus bearing registration no.HR68A/2180 on the date of accident and he appeared as PW10. He filed affidavit Ex.PW10/A, wherein he deposed about the accident to the effect that on 31.3.2015, he alongwith students and staff was going from Ambala Cantt. to SDDI Global College and AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 38 SRM Institute of Technology at village Bhurewala, while driving College Bus no.HR68A/2180 at moderate speed on left side of the road and around 7.30/8.00 AM when reached in the area of village Rajpura on Saha Road, offending Dumper/Tipper no.HR37C/8635 being driven by respondent no.1 at very fast speed and in rash and negligent manner, came from opposite side and upon this he lowered down the speed of his Bus and came on extreme left side of the road, but said Dumper came on wrong side of the road and struck against the Bus, resultantly, all passengers in the Bus received multiple and grievous injuries. He further deposed that due to this accident, Aamir Furqan, Vipin wife of Sahil, Parminder Singh, Manish Kumar, Kesar Singh, Ankit Gupta and Deepak Sharma died at the spot. In his cross-examination, he admitted that driver side of Tipper struck against driver side of his Bus and sand/soil entered the Bus from front wind screen as both winds screens of the Bus had broken. So PW10 has admitted in his cross-examination that both wind screens of his Bus had broken and soil/sand came inside the bus. 32.Pawan Kumar (appeared as PW10 in this case), who was driving the Bus in question, appeared as PW16 in criminal case titled as 'State versus Rohit' pertaining to FIR no.41 dated 31.3.2014 registered for commission of offences punishable u/Ss.279, 337, 338, 304 IPC in Police Station Shahzadpur in regard to the accident in question and in his statement dated 16.2.2016 Ex.P41, he deposed that soil of the Tipper entered the Bus when Bus came in contact with the Tipper and stated that AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 39 it was a head-on-collision. He admitted that photographs attached with the file are the same photographs, which were taken after the accident. He further admitted that driver of the Tipper had not received any injury in said accident and driver side of the Tipper had not damaged in the accident. 33.The statement of RW1 is most relevant and he deposed that on 31.3.2015, he was driving Tipper no.HR37C/8635 on correct side of the road at moderate speed and when reached T-point Rajpura, a tractor trolley came on the road and took sudden turn from the T-point, on which he applied sudden brakes, due to which his Tipper turned sideways and when it was lying on the road, the College Bus no.HR68A/2180 came from opposite side rashly and negligently at high speed and dashed against the Tipper from back side, resultantly, the mud lying in the goods wagon of the Tipper entered the Bus from its windscreen and front windows, as a result thereof the mishap took place. 34.It is clear from statement of RW1 that he had not received any injury in said accident. In his cross-examination he deposed that driver of the Bus was driving his Bus in a rash and negligent manner at high speed and could not control his Bus on seeing the over-turned Tipper. He further deposed that said accident could have been avoided by bus driver, if he had controlled the same. It is admitted fact that respondent no.1 had not suffered any injury and it is not the case of claimants or respondent no.4 that any other occupant of the Tipper had suffered injuries in the accident. AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 40 35.PW5 Amit Saini filed his affidavit Ex.PW5/A and in his cross-examination deposed that driver side of the Bus struck against the conductor side of the truck and both drivers suffered injuries. However his statement is totally contradictory to statements of other witnesses and against record. It is matter of record that driver of Tipper had not suffered any injury. It is also very relevant to mention here that while appearing as PW11 in criminal case, PW Amit Saini deposed that there was T-point at the place of accident and Tipper was carrying mud. He further deposed that mud of the Tipper pumped in the Bus, when Bus came in contact with the Tipper and due to entering of mud, there occurred suffocation and many persons died. 36.PW12 Vivek Sharma deposed that accident occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Tipper driver and police had recorded his statement, wherein he had made same statement regarding cause of accident. But while appearing as PW15 in criminal case titled as State versus Rohit, Vivek Sharma deposed that he does not know as to how said accident occurred. He deposed that he had not made any statement to police. He denied the suggestion that said Tipper was being driven in a rash and negligent manner. He further denied the suggestion that said accident occurred due to negligence of accused. Considering above facts, this Tribunal is of the view that PW12 is not a reliable witness as he has changed his stand from one Court to other. 37.PW8 Ajay Kumar (in present case) appeared as PW10 in criminal case and deposed that he had not seen the driver of Tipper at the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 41 spot. He deposed that only left side of the Tipper was damaged. This Tribunal is of the view that he is not a reliable witness and can not be believed on the point of cause of accident, as being employee of the College, his interest is to avoid liability of the College. While appearing as PW8, he deposed that he was sitting on front seat i.e. conductor seat of the Bus. If he is believed, then version of respondent no.1 is also true that Bus dashed against the Tipper when same had already turned turtle on the road and so PW8 Ajay Kumar has rightly deposed before other Court that he had not seen driver of the Tipper at the spot. 38.It is matter of record that most of the other injured persons, who were travelling in the Bus on that day, while appearing as witnesses in the criminal case titled as State versus Rohit Kumar, admitted that there was curve near the place of occurrence and when driver of Tipper applied brakes, the Tipper turned turtle on the road and they deposed that can not identify driver of the Tipper. They admitted that Bus had entered the mud of the Tipper. 39.After considering the statement dated 16.2.2016 Ex.P41 of Pawan Kumar, this Tribunal is of the view that version of PW10 Pawan Kumar is not believable, as had it been a case of head-on-collision, the driver side of the Tipper would have damaged totally as impact of the accident was such that many persons travelling in the Bus died and other occupants of the Bus suffered grievous injuries. The case file of criminal case titled as “State versus Rohit” was also summoned at the time of arguments in this case and photographs of Tipper bearing registration AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 42 no.HR37C/8635 are on that judicial file, from which it is apparent that driver side of the Tipper even did not hit the Bus and so version of claimants specifically PW10 (driver of bus) regarding head-on-collision is totally false. The photographs on record of criminal case file speak otherwise and substantiate the arguments raised by ld. counsel for respondents no.1 to 3. 40.Sudden crossing of the road by a human being or a child; sudden presence of a stray animal on the road; bursting of tyre due to some alien sharp edge article lying on the road; sudden collapse of the bridge; fall of electric wires; tornado; storm; flush of rain water from cloud burst, etc. are a few illustrative circumstances in which driver of a vehicle can possibly lose control. In any such like sudden events, the drive would try to control the vehicle and may apply sudden brakes, which, instead of stopping the vehicle, may over turn it or cause slip thereby the vehicle might go out of the driver's control. Such kind of accident, happening of which is beyond the control of a driver, may be termed as an “act of God”. However, where the vehicle was in sound roadworthy condition and was driven with an ordinary care, it shall always be expected that it will not go out of control of the driver, yet if any such thing happens, heavy onus shall lie upon either the driver or the owner of the vehicle to divulge that special knowledge of the relevant facts to explain as to why and how the vehicle went out of control of the driver. In the absence of any such explanation, the maxim ' res ipsa loquitur' would undoubtedly be attracted, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 43 Court in Krishna Bus Service Ltd. vs. Smt. Mangli and others AIR 1976 SC 700. 41.The site plan prepared by police after the accident is on record as Ex.P40, from which it is clear that there was a curve near the place of accident and so the version of RW1 Rohit Kumar is believable that in order to avoid the accident with tractor, he had applied brakes and the tractor turned turtle. However, considering the fact that he was also driving at very high speed and that had he been driving at moderate speed, he could have controlled the vehicle. The principle of res ipsa loquitur applies to this case and it can be safely concluded that respondent no.4 was also responsible and had contributed in causing the accident. It is a clear cut case of contributory negligence. From photographs on record, it is apparent that the sand/soil entered the Bus up to about six feet from front of the Bus and it speaks about the speed, at which respondent no.1 was driving the Bus. 42.The claimants and their witnesses had tried their best to prove that it was head-on-collision and respondent no.1 was responsible for the accident. However after perusing entire record and statements of witnesses in criminal case titled as 'State versus Rohit', it is clear that there was a curve near the place of accident and somehow on applying brakes, the Tipper turned turtle on the road, which shows that respondent no.1 was driving the Tipper at high speed and had he been driving at moderate speed, he could have controlled his vehicle, but failed to do so. But on the other hand, it is also clear that respondent no.4 Pawan Kumar AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 44 was driving the Bus at such a high speed that mud loaded in the Tipper entered the Bus, as clear from admissions made by the witnesses and photographs clicked after the accident, which are on record of criminal case file. The quantity of sand/soil entered the Bus was so much that the occupants of the Bus felt suffocated and this suffocation was also the result of some deaths. Had respondent no.4 been driving the College Bus at moderate speed and in a careful manner, even if the Tipper had turned turtle in front of the Bus, the accident could have been avoided. So this can be safely concluded that respondent no.4 Pawan Kumar, driver of the Bus, was also responsible in causing of the accident and so accident was the result of negligence on the part of respondent no.1 (Rohit Kumar) and respondent no.4 (Pawan Kumar) and it is a case of contributory negligence. Both drivers were equally responsible for the accident. 43.After considering the entire evidence on record, it is held that claimed have successfully proved that Aman Sharma, Ajay Kumar, Pritam Singh, Yogesh, Pawan, Vivek and Amit Saini had suffered injuries in the accident in dispute and Deepak Sharma, Parminder Singh, Aamir Furqan and Manish Kumar died due to the injuries suffered in the accident in question. 44.After considering entire evidence on record and keeping in view the above discussion, it is held that accident was not the result of rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 only, but respondent no.4 had also contributed in causing of the accident and both drivers were equally responsible in causing the accident on that day. It is a case of AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 45 contributory negligence. Issue no.1 is decided accordingly. ISSUE NO.2: MACP No.208 of 2015 Aman Sharma vs. Rohit & others 45.In this petition, compensation has been claimed by claimant on account of injuries suffered by her. In the petition, claimant has claimed compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the accident. It has been pleaded that claimant suffered multiple, serious and grievous injuries including multiple fractures in right ankle and foot and that after the accident, she was shifted to Civil Hospital Ambala Cantt. She pleaded that she remained under treatment of private doctors and remained admitted as an indoor patient for many days and spent Rs.1,00,000/- on her treatment, transportation and special diet. 46.Claimant Aman Sharma appeared as PW6 and filed her affidavit Ex.PW6/A, wherein she reiterated the contents of petition regarding suffering of injuries, fractures suffered and shifting to Civil Hospital. She deposed that she spent Rs.1,00,000/- on treatment, medicines, instruments, transportation and special diet. She further deposed that she was 24 years of age and was employed as Lab Technician in Electronics and Communication Branch, S.D.D.I. Global College, village Bhurewala, District Ambala and was getting Rs.7,000/- per month. She further deposed that after said accident, she is not in a position to perform her daily routine and has become permanently disabled and is still under treatment. In cross examination, she deposed AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 46 that she has not brought any proof regarding injuries suffered by her, treatment, medical expenses and her income. 47.To substantiate her claim regarding her disability and injuries suffered in the accident, she has placed on record MLR Ex.P43 and Disability Certificate, issued by Medical Board of three doctors of General Hospital, Ambala City, as Ex.P44. From the MLR Ex.P43, it is clear that she suffered one injury i.e. on leg below knee joint. Due to fracture, she was operated upon and due to the injuries suffered, she suffered permanent disability. As per Disability Certificate Ex.P44, petitioner suffered disability to the extent of 5%. In view of the fact that she suffered permanent disability to the extent of 5%, Rs.10,000/- is awarded under the head of permanent disability. 48.Neither prescription slips nor any Bill showing purchase of medicines has been placed on record by the claimant to substantiate her claim regarding amount spent on treatment. Considering the nature of injuries suffered by petitioner and facts of the case, Rs.30,000/- is awarded in lump sum under the head of pain and suffering, special diet, transportation, attendant charges and loss of income. So, in total, Rs.40,000/- is awarded to claimant as compensation in this case.

It is further submitted that if it is concluded that accident occurred due to composite/contributory rash and negligent driving of respondent no.4, then respondent no.6 is liable to pay the compensation. On merits, it is submitted that in fact, accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving Tipper/Dumper in question rashly and negligently at fast speed and that answering respondent was driving the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 32 Bus in question at normal speed on correct side of the road.

It is further submitted that petition has been filed after due consultation just to get compensation from answering respondent Denying all other averments, dismissal of petition was prayed for. 18.Though separate written statements were filed by respondents in each connected claim petition, yet same stand, as taken in main MACP no.208 of 2015 titled as Aman Sharma versus Rohit Kumar and others, has been taken. 19.Replication was not filed. From pleadings of parties, following issues were framed: 1.Whether the accident in question took place by rash and negligent driving of Tipper/Dumper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635 by respondent no.1 Rohit Kumar resulting into injuries to Aman Sharma, Ajay Kumar, Pritam Singh, Yogesh, Pawan, Vivek and Amit Saini and death of Deepak Sharma, Parminder Singh, Aamir Furqan and Manish Kumar, as alleged? OPP AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 34 2If Issue no.1 is proved, then whether the claimants are entitled to compensation, if so, how much and from whom? OPP 3Whether respondent no.1 was driving offending vehicle in violation of terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy, if so, its effect? OPR (3) 4Relief 20.Petitioners, in order to prove their case, examined as many as thirteen witnesses: PW1 Harpreet Kaur PW2 Manju PW3 Aliya Khatun PW4 Pritam Singh PW5 Amit Saini PW6 Aman Sharma PW7 Alka Sharma PW8 Ajay Kumar PW9 Yogesh PW10 Pawan Kumar PW11 Dr. Vikas Paul PW12 Vivek Sharma PW13 Amarjeet In documentary evidence, documents Ex.P37 to 178 were tendered. AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 35 21.On the other hand, respondents examined RW1 Rohit Kumar/respondent no.1. In documentary evidence, documents Ex.R1 to Ex.R11 were tendered. 22.No rebuttal evidence was led. 23.After due consideration of the arguments and evidence of both parties, the findings on the above issues along with reasons for the decision are given below:- ISSUE NO.1: 24.Burden to prove this issue was upon claimants. Ld. counsel for claimants submitted that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving vehicle no.HR37C/8635 in a rash and negligent manner. Ld. counsel relied upon the statements of PW4 to PW6, PW8 to PW10 and PW12 and copy of Challan Ex.P37 and copy of charge-sheet dated 30.07.2015 Ex.P38. and submitted that respondent no.1 was responsible for causing the accident as he was driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. 25.On the other hand, ld. counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 submitted that PW10 Pawan Kumar was driving Bus no.HR68A/2180 in a rash and negligent manner and he could have avoided the accident if he had control over his Bus as he dashed his bus against the Dumper/Tipper, which had turned turtle on the road. Ld. counsel further submitted that last control was in hands of PW10 and had he been driving his bus at moderate speed, the accident could have been avoided. 26.Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 Shri Mohinder Bindal AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 36 Advocate supported the arguments raised by ld. counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 and submitted that even if it is taken that respondent no.1 was not driving Dumper/Tipper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635 at moderate speed and so the Dumper turned turtle in middle of the road, even then the accident could have been avoided by PW10 Pawan Kumar by applying brakes, but he could not control his bus as he was driving in a rash and negligent manner and at high speed and his bus dashed against the Dumper/Tipper bearing registration no.HR37C/8635. Ld. counsel further submitted that all injured witnesses have wrongly deposed that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and these witnesses can not be believed as they have wrongly deposed the facts only in order to support the case of College authorities and to support PW10, so that College be not held liable to pay compensation. Ld. counsel further submitted that PW10 Pawan Kumar appeared as PW16 in criminal case titled as State versus Rohit and admitted that driver of the Tipper/Dumper had not received any injury in the accident and driver side of said Tipper was not damaged, so entire version of claimants and PW10 that it was head-on-collision between Bus and truck, is not believable. Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 further submitted that even if it is taken that respondent no.1 was also responsible for the accident, even then this case is of contributory negligence. 27. Ld. counsel for respondents no.4 to 6 supported the case of claimants and submitted that only respondent no.1 was responsible for the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 37 accident as he was driving vehicle no.HR37C/8653 in a rash and negligent manner. Ld. counsel further submitted that there is no evidence on record, from which it can be held that it is a case of contributory negligence and Pawan Kumar driver was also responsible for causing the accident. 28.I have given anxious consideration to the arguments raised by ld. counsel for the parties and have perused record of the case. 29.In this case, thirteen (13) witnesses have been examined on behalf of petitioners and respondent no.1 Rohit appeared as RW1. Statements of PW1 to PW3, PW7, PW11 and PW13 are not relevant for decision of Issue no.1. 30.This Tribunal is of the view that once drivers of both vehicles have appeared in the witness box i.e. Pawan Kumar/respondent no.4 as PW10 and Rohit Kumar/respondent no.1 as RW1, then statements of other injured witnesses are not so relevant as the drivers would be the best witnesses to make statement about manner, in which accident occurred. Otherwise also, there are vital contradictions om material points in statements of other eye-witness/injured witnesses i.e. PW4 to PW7, PW8, PW9 and PW12. 31.Pawan Kumar/respondent no.4 was driving College Bus bearing registration no.HR68A/2180 on the date of accident and he appeared as PW10. He filed affidavit Ex.PW10/A, wherein he deposed about the accident to the effect that on 31.3.2015, he alongwith students and staff was going from Ambala Cantt. to SDDI Global College and AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 38 SRM Institute of Technology at village Bhurewala, while driving College Bus no.HR68A/2180 at moderate speed on left side of the road and around 7.30/8.00 AM when reached in the area of village Rajpura on Saha Road, offending Dumper/Tipper no.HR37C/8635 being driven by respondent no.1 at very fast speed and in rash and negligent manner, came from opposite side and upon this he lowered down the speed of his Bus and came on extreme left side of the road, but said Dumper came on wrong side of the road and struck against the Bus, resultantly, all passengers in the Bus received multiple and grievous injuries. He further deposed that due to this accident, Aamir Furqan, Vipin wife of Sahil, Parminder Singh, Manish Kumar, Kesar Singh, Ankit Gupta and Deepak Sharma died at the spot. In his cross-examination, he admitted that driver side of Tipper struck against driver side of his Bus and sand/soil entered the Bus from front wind screen as both winds screens of the Bus had broken. So PW10 has admitted in his cross-examination that both wind screens of his Bus had broken and soil/sand came inside the bus. 32.Pawan Kumar (appeared as PW10 in this case), who was driving the Bus in question, appeared as PW16 in criminal case titled as 'State versus Rohit' pertaining to FIR no.41 dated 31.3.2014 registered for commission of offences punishable u/Ss.279, 337, 338, 304 IPC in Police Station Shahzadpur in regard to the accident in question and in his statement dated 16.2.2016 Ex.P41, he deposed that soil of the Tipper entered the Bus when Bus came in contact with the Tipper and stated that AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 39 it was a head-on-collision. He admitted that photographs attached with the file are the same photographs, which were taken after the accident. He further admitted that driver of the Tipper had not received any injury in said accident and driver side of the Tipper had not damaged in the accident. 33.The statement of RW1 is most relevant and he deposed that on 31.3.2015, he was driving Tipper no.HR37C/8635 on correct side of the road at moderate speed and when reached T-point Rajpura, a tractor trolley came on the road and took sudden turn from the T-point, on which he applied sudden brakes, due to which his Tipper turned sideways and when it was lying on the road, the College Bus no.HR68A/2180 came from opposite side rashly and negligently at high speed and dashed against the Tipper from back side, resultantly, the mud lying in the goods wagon of the Tipper entered the Bus from its windscreen and front windows, as a result thereof the mishap took place. 34.It is clear from statement of RW1 that he had not received any injury in said accident. In his cross-examination he deposed that driver of the Bus was driving his Bus in a rash and negligent manner at high speed and could not control his Bus on seeing the over-turned Tipper. He further deposed that said accident could have been avoided by bus driver, if he had controlled the same. It is admitted fact that respondent no.1 had not suffered any injury and it is not the case of claimants or respondent no.4 that any other occupant of the Tipper had suffered injuries in the accident. AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 40 35.PW5 Amit Saini filed his affidavit Ex.PW5/A and in his cross-examination deposed that driver side of the Bus struck against the conductor side of the truck and both drivers suffered injuries. However his statement is totally contradictory to statements of other witnesses and against record. It is matter of record that driver of Tipper had not suffered any injury. It is also very relevant to mention here that while appearing as PW11 in criminal case, PW Amit Saini deposed that there was T-point at the place of accident and Tipper was carrying mud. He further deposed that mud of the Tipper pumped in the Bus, when Bus came in contact with the Tipper and due to entering of mud, there occurred suffocation and many persons died. 36.PW12 Vivek Sharma deposed that accident occurred due to sole rash and negligent driving of Tipper driver and police had recorded his statement, wherein he had made same statement regarding cause of accident. But while appearing as PW15 in criminal case titled as State versus Rohit, Vivek Sharma deposed that he does not know as to how said accident occurred. He deposed that he had not made any statement to police. He denied the suggestion that said Tipper was being driven in a rash and negligent manner. He further denied the suggestion that said accident occurred due to negligence of accused. Considering above facts, this Tribunal is of the view that PW12 is not a reliable witness as he has changed his stand from one Court to other. 37.PW8 Ajay Kumar (in present case) appeared as PW10 in criminal case and deposed that he had not seen the driver of Tipper at the AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 41 spot. He deposed that only left side of the Tipper was damaged. This Tribunal is of the view that he is not a reliable witness and can not be believed on the point of cause of accident, as being employee of the College, his interest is to avoid liability of the College. While appearing as PW8, he deposed that he was sitting on front seat i.e. conductor seat of the Bus. If he is believed, then version of respondent no.1 is also true that Bus dashed against the Tipper when same had already turned turtle on the road and so PW8 Ajay Kumar has rightly deposed before other Court that he had not seen driver of the Tipper at the spot. 38.It is matter of record that most of the other injured persons, who were travelling in the Bus on that day, while appearing as witnesses in the criminal case titled as State versus Rohit Kumar, admitted that there was curve near the place of occurrence and when driver of Tipper applied brakes, the Tipper turned turtle on the road and they deposed that can not identify driver of the Tipper. They admitted that Bus had entered the mud of the Tipper. 39.After considering the statement dated 16.2.2016 Ex.P41 of Pawan Kumar, this Tribunal is of the view that version of PW10 Pawan Kumar is not believable, as had it been a case of head-on-collision, the driver side of the Tipper would have damaged totally as impact of the accident was such that many persons travelling in the Bus died and other occupants of the Bus suffered grievous injuries. The case file of criminal case titled as “State versus Rohit” was also summoned at the time of arguments in this case and photographs of Tipper bearing registration AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 42 no.HR37C/8635 are on that judicial file, from which it is apparent that driver side of the Tipper even did not hit the Bus and so version of claimants specifically PW10 (driver of bus) regarding head-on-collision is totally false. The photographs on record of criminal case file speak otherwise and substantiate the arguments raised by ld. counsel for respondents no.1 to 3. 40.Sudden crossing of the road by a human being or a child; sudden presence of a stray animal on the road; bursting of tyre due to some alien sharp edge article lying on the road; sudden collapse of the bridge; fall of electric wires; tornado; storm; flush of rain water from cloud burst, etc. are a few illustrative circumstances in which driver of a vehicle can possibly lose control. In any such like sudden events, the drive would try to control the vehicle and may apply sudden brakes, which, instead of stopping the vehicle, may over turn it or cause slip thereby the vehicle might go out of the driver's control. Such kind of accident, happening of which is beyond the control of a driver, may be termed as an “act of God”. However, where the vehicle was in sound roadworthy condition and was driven with an ordinary care, it shall always be expected that it will not go out of control of the driver, yet if any such thing happens, heavy onus shall lie upon either the driver or the owner of the vehicle to divulge that special knowledge of the relevant facts to explain as to why and how the vehicle went out of control of the driver. In the absence of any such explanation, the maxim ' res ipsa loquitur' would undoubtedly be attracted, as held by the Hon'ble Supreme AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 43 Court in Krishna Bus Service Ltd. vs. Smt. Mangli and others AIR 1976 SC 700. 41.The site plan prepared by police after the accident is on record as Ex.P40, from which it is clear that there was a curve near the place of accident and so the version of RW1 Rohit Kumar is believable that in order to avoid the accident with tractor, he had applied brakes and the tractor turned turtle. However, considering the fact that he was also driving at very high speed and that had he been driving at moderate speed, he could have controlled the vehicle. The principle of res ipsa loquitur applies to this case and it can be safely concluded that respondent no.4 was also responsible and had contributed in causing the accident. It is a clear cut case of contributory negligence. From photographs on record, it is apparent that the sand/soil entered the Bus up to about six feet from front of the Bus and it speaks about the speed, at which respondent no.1 was driving the Bus. 42.The claimants and their witnesses had tried their best to prove that it was head-on-collision and respondent no.1 was responsible for the accident. However after perusing entire record and statements of witnesses in criminal case titled as 'State versus Rohit', it is clear that there was a curve near the place of accident and somehow on applying brakes, the Tipper turned turtle on the road, which shows that respondent no.1 was driving the Tipper at high speed and had he been driving at moderate speed, he could have controlled his vehicle, but failed to do so. But on the other hand, it is also clear that respondent no.4 Pawan Kumar AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 44 was driving the Bus at such a high speed that mud loaded in the Tipper entered the Bus, as clear from admissions made by the witnesses and photographs clicked after the accident, which are on record of criminal case file. The quantity of sand/soil entered the Bus was so much that the occupants of the Bus felt suffocated and this suffocation was also the result of some deaths. Had respondent no.4 been driving the College Bus at moderate speed and in a careful manner, even if the Tipper had turned turtle in front of the Bus, the accident could have been avoided. So this can be safely concluded that respondent no.4 Pawan Kumar, driver of the Bus, was also responsible in causing of the accident and so accident was the result of negligence on the part of respondent no.1 (Rohit Kumar) and respondent no.4 (Pawan Kumar) and it is a case of contributory negligence. Both drivers were equally responsible for the accident. 43.After considering the entire evidence on record, it is held that claimed have successfully proved that Aman Sharma, Ajay Kumar, Pritam Singh, Yogesh, Pawan, Vivek and Amit Saini had suffered injuries in the accident in dispute and Deepak Sharma, Parminder Singh, Aamir Furqan and Manish Kumar died due to the injuries suffered in the accident in question. 44.After considering entire evidence on record and keeping in view the above discussion, it is held that accident was not the result of rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 only, but respondent no.4 had also contributed in causing of the accident and both drivers were equally responsible in causing the accident on that day. It is a case of AMAN SHARMA VERSUS ROHIT KUMAR & OTHERS 45 contributory negligence. Issue no.1 is decided accordingly. ISSUE NO.2: MACP No.208 of 2015 Aman Sharma vs. Rohit & others 45.In this petition, compensation has been claimed by claimant on account of injuries suffered by her.

It is further submitted that accident occurred due to own negligence of Davinder and a false FIR has been got lodged against respondent no.1 in collusion with police.

OPR (3) 4Relief 6.In order to prove their case, petitioner herself stepped as PW1, examined Sukh Ram as PW2 and Arun Sharma as PW3. After tendering documents Ex.P1 to Ex.P6, ld. counsel for petitioners closed the evidence. BABITA & ANOTHER VS. HOSHIAR SINGH & OTHERS 5 7.On the other hand, the respondents did not adduce any oral evidence. In documentary evidence, ld. counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 tendered documents Ex.R1 to Ex.R5 and closed the evidence. No document was tendered on behalf of respondent no.3. 8.No rebuttal evidence was led. 9.I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the material pleadings, evidence and the legal proposition applicable to the present case. My findings on the above issues are as under:- ISSUE NO.1: 10.Burden to prove this issue was upon the claimants. Ld. counsel for claimants relied upon the statement of PW2 Sukh Ram and submitted that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving truck bearing no.HP12A/9644 in a rash and negligent manner. 11.Ld. counsel for respondents submitted that Davinder (deceased) was equally responsible for the accident, as admittedly there was head-on-collision between two trucks. Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 produced some photographs of the place of accident and submitted that there was head-on-collision and so both the drivers be held liable for the accident. Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 relied upon the Judgments in the case of Sukhbir Singh and another versus Ram Mehar and others, 2011 (2) PLR 97; Bijoy Kumar Dugar versus Bidyadhar Dutta & Ors. II (2006) ACC 36 (SC ) and Agnuru Jaya Ramulu versus Mohammed Afzal Miyan and another, 2006 ACJ 855 (AP ). BABITA & ANOTHER VS. HOSHIAR SINGH & OTHERS 6 12.PW2 Sukh Ram filed his affidavit Ex.PW2/A in his evidence and deposed that on 23.5.2015, early in morning, he alongwith Davinder started from Parwanoo for Delhi in truck no.HP15/8964 loaded with Soaps and that Davinder was driving the truck at moderate speed on correct side of the road. He further deposed that around 7.00 AM, when they reached near Naggwa Bridge on Saha-Shahbad Road, a truck bearing registration no.HP12A/9644 being driven by respondent no.1 at high speed rashly and negligently came from Shahbad side and struck against their truck no.HP15/8964 in a head-on-collision manner. He further deposed that this accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 while driving truck no.HP12A/9644. In his cross- examination PW2 deposed that there was head-on-collision between two trucks. FIR Ex.P6 was registered on the statement of Sukh Ram, who appeared in this case as PW2. It is clear from FIR Ex.P6 that there was head-on-collision between two trucks bearing registration no.HP15/8964 and HP12A/9644. Davinder (now deceased) was driving truck no.HP15/8964 at the time of accident. After investigation of the case, final report u/S 173 Cr.PC Ex.P1 was filed against respondent no.1 and respondent no.1 Hoshiar Singh was charge-sheeted for commission of offences punishable u/Ss.279, 337 and 304-A IPC, as clear from the charge-sheet dated 7.10.2015 Ex.P3. 13.In view of the law laid down in the case of Sukhbir Singh (Supra), it can not be held that driver of truck bearing registration no.HP12A/9644 was solely responsible for the accident, as there was BABITA & ANOTHER VS. HOSHIAR SINGH & OTHERS 7 head-on-collision between two trucks. The claimants failed to produce site plan and photographs, taken immediately after the accident, which entails adverse inference against the claimants. As there was head-on-collision between two vehicles, it can be safely concluded that drivers of both the vehicles were negligent in driving their respective vehicle. In the case of Bijoy Kumar Dugar (Supra) , Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that in case of head-on-collision, drivers of both the vehicles should be held responsible to have contributed equally to the accident. 14.At the time of arguments, ld. counsel for Insurance Company produced photographs, which were taken immediately after the accident and therefrom it is clear that vehicle no.HP15/8964 driven by Davinder Bahadur (now deceased) turned turtle, which also shows that Davinder Bahadur was also driving the truck in a rash and negligent manner. In view of above discussion, it is held that although FIR has been registered against respondent no.1 Hoshiar Singh for driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner, but Davinder (now deceased), who was driving vehicle no.HP15/8964, was also driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and the accident was the result of rash and negligent driving of both the drivers. Accordingly, it is held that Davinder (deceased) and respondent no.1 were equally responsible for causing the accident. However, it is clear from record that Davinder (deceased) died due to the injuries suffered in the accident. Issue no.1 is decided accordingly. ISSUE NO.2: BABITA & ANOTHER VS. HOSHIAR SINGH & OTHERS 8 15.Petitioner no.1 Babita, wife of Davinder Bahadur (now deceased), appeared as PW1 and deposed that Davinder Bahadur (now deceased) was her husband and he was working as Driver with Anuspaa Heritage Products Pvt. Ltd., Plot no.3, Khadin Industrial Estate, Parwanoo (HP) and was drawing salary of Rs.8800/- per month. She further deposed that Davinder was 33 years of age at the time of accident. She further deposed that Davinder used to bring his whole salary at home and he was the only bread earner in the family and that due to his untimely death, she has been deprived of love and affection of her husband. She further deposed that she spent Rs.50,000/- on transportation and last rites of her husband. 16.PW3 Arun Sharma proved appointment letter Ex.PW3/A of Davinder Bahadur as Driver with the firm Anuspaa Heritage Products Pvt. Ltd. It is clear from Ex.PW3/A that Davinder Bahadur (now deceased) was getting salary of Rs.7800/- per month. Accordingly, monthly income of Davinder Bahadur (now deceased) is assessed as Rs.7800/- per month. 1/3rd of the assessed monthly income is to be deducted towards personal expenses of deceased and after deduction, the monthly loss of dependency comes to Rs.5200/- and annual loss of dependency comes to Rs.62,400/-. 17.As per Postmortem Report Ex.P5, aged of deceased was 32- 33 years at the time of his death. In view of the settled law, multiplier of '16' is to be applied and on applying multiplier of '16', the total loss of dependency comes to Rs.9,98,400/-. Accordingly, Rs.9,98,400/- is awarded under the head of loss of dependency. BABITA & ANOTHER VS. HOSHIAR SINGH & OTHERS 9 18.Petitioner no.1 is also entitled to get compensation of Rs.1,00,000/- under the head of loss of consortium and Rs.25,000/- under the head of last rites. Petitioner no.2 is also entitled to Rs.1,00,000/- under the head of love and affection, as she has lost her father and has been deprived of love, care and affection of her father. 19.In this way, total compensation comes to Rs.12,23,400/-. In view of the Judgment in the case of Sukbir Singh (Supra) and findings given under Issue no.1, the accident was the result of contributory negligence and so respondent no.1 is liable to pay only 50% of the total compensation assessed. Accordingly, petitioners are entitled to get 50% of the above assessed amount of compensation and accordingly, Rs.6,11,700/- is awarded in favour of petitioners. 20.The truck bearing registration no. HP12A/9644 was insured with respondent no.3 vide policy Ex.R3 on the date of the accident. Hence, all respondents are held jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation amount. ISSUE NO.3: 21.Burden to prove this issue was upon the respondent no.3- Insurance Company, but no evidence has been led to prove this issue. Hence, this issue is decided against respondent no.3. Relief: 22.In view of above discussion and findings on the issues, the claim petition is partly allowed. A sum of Rs.6,11,700/- is awarded in favour of petitioners. Petitioners shall also get interest on the awarded BABITA & ANOTHER VS. HOSHIAR SINGH & OTHERS 10 amount at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of institution of the petition till payment. Both petitioners shall get equal share in the amount awarded. 70% of the amount awarded in favour of petitioner no.1 shall be deposited in a nationalized bank in her name in the shape of FDR for 5 years and the rest of the amount of her share shall be released in cash. 100% of the amount awarded in favour of petitioner no.2 shall be deposited in a nationalized bank in her name in the shape of FDR till the date of attaining majority.

It is averred that, when he reached in the area of bus-stand of village Badi Bassi at about 11.30 a.m. bus bearing registration no.HR-37-D-3975 came from behind being driven rashly and negligently by respondent no.1 and after overtaking, applied brakes without giving any signal, as a result thereof, the bus and motorcycle collided and the petitioner suffered multiple injuries. It is further averred that, passersby admitted the petitioner in hospital at Naraingarh, where from was referred to Govt. Medical College & Hospital, Sector 32, Chandigarh. It is further averred that, this accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving and wrong overtaking by respondent no.1. It is further averred that a case has been also registered with police station Shahzadpur on his statement against Gurdeep Singh, the respondent no.1 vide FIR no.10 dated 20.01.2015, under Sections 279/337 IPC. It is further averred that, as the said accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of bus bearing registration no.HR- 37-D-3975 by respondent no.1; therefore, the respondent no.1 being driver, the respondent no.2 being owner and the respondent no.3, being insurer of the vehicle in question are liable jointly and severally to pay CHHAJU RAM VERSUS GURPREET SINGH & OTHERS -3- compensation to the petitioner. 3The petition has been contested by respondents no.1 and 2 by filing joint written statement.

It is further averred that respondent no.1 was not involved in the said accident. It is further averred that, no accident had taken place with the vehicle of answering respondents being driven by respondent no.1, as alleged.

The accident has also been denied and it is further averred that petitioner has concocted the alleged story of accident. It is further averred that, petitioner was overtaking a vehicle; could not control his motorcycle; fell down and might have suffered alleged injuries. In additional pleas, it is averred that if the accident is proved, then answering respondent also takes the plea of composite/contributory negligence and the same diminishes the claim of the petitioner against the answering respondent. With these averments, prayer for dismissal of CHHAJU RAM VERSUS GURPREET SINGH & OTHERS -4- claim petition has been made. 5From pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed for adjudication on 28.09.2015:- 1Whether the accident in question took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 while driving bus bearing registration no.HR-37-D-3975 causing injuries to Chhaju Ram, the claimant, as alleged?

OPR-3 4Relief. 6In order to substantiate his case, Chhaju Ram, the petitioner besides examining himself as PW1, has also tendered copy of MLR as Ex.P1, FIR as Ex.P2, order as Ex.P3, dated 06.04.2015 framing charge under Sections 279/337/338 IPC against accused Gurpreet Singh, report under Section 173 CrPC as Ex.P4, discharge and follow-up card as Ex.P5 of PGI, Chandigarh, driving licence as Ex.P6, ration card as Ex.P7, voters card as Ex.P8 and thereafter learned counsel for petitioner after tendering copy of Jamabandi as Ex.P9, medical bills/receipts as Ex.P10 to as Ex.P25 closed the evidence vide statement dated 01.12.2015. 7On the other hand, learned counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 after tendering copy of permits as Ex.R1, as Ex.R2, registration certificate as Ex.R3 of vehicle bearing chassis no.MB1PBEFC5EPX CHHAJU RAM VERSUS GURPREET SINGH & OTHERS -5- K5804; engine no.EXPZ110592, insurance cover note as Ex.R4, driving licence as Ex.R5, as Ex.R6 of respondent no.1 closed their evidence vide statement dated 23.12.2015. Learned counsel for respondent no.3 after tendering insurance policy as Ex.R7 of vehicle bearing chassis no.MB1PBEFC5EPXK5804; engine no.EXPZ110592, valid from 13.05.2014 to 12.05.2015 closed its evidence vide statement dated 12.01.2016. 8Arguments have been addressed by the learned counsels for the parties and the records have also been perused. My issue-wise findings are as under:- Issue no.1: 9In order to prove this issue, Chhaju Ram, PW1, the petitioner has deposed by way of affidavit, as Ex.PW1/A tendered in his examination-in-chief, reiterating the contents of petition. During cross examination, he has deposed that bus had come from behind; after overtaking him suddenly applied brakes and then he struck with the bus. He has further deposed that he had read registration number of the bus on the spot and the same was disclosed to his brother. He has further deposed that, his motorcycle had struck against right side of the bus from behind. He has further deposed that he had tried to apply brakes, but there was no possibility of the same. Gurpreet Singh, the respondent no.1 did not step into the witness box to rebut the evidence led by claimant. Learned CHHAJU RAM VERSUS GURPREET SINGH & OTHERS -6- counsel for the claimant has relied upon Raju & ors. Versus Sukhwinder Singh & ors. 2007(III) ACC page 254, wherein Hon' ble Punjab and Haryana High Court has held that “ driver of truck did not enter witness box to deny allegations of witness regarding his involvement in accident; adverse inference can be drawn against him. Further it is absolutely necessary to have the first hand report from the driver. It may be that the driver does not always speak the truth, but the driver's version is the one which is to be given the best consideration. He only knows as to what actually happened. Therefore, the driver having not been examined, necessarily, an adverse inference arises against him ”. Learned counsel for the petitioner has urged that, factum of registration of FIR no.10 dated 20.01.2015, under Sections 279/337 IPC with Police Station Shahzadpur, District Ambala, as Ex.P2, coupled with order as Ex.P3 dated 06.04.2015 framing charge against accused Gurpeet Singh under Sections 279/337/338 IPC, report under Section 173 CrPC as Ex.P4 filed against accused Gurpreet Singh @ in the said FIR are sufficient to arrive at the conclusion that, the accident in question causing injuries to Chhaju Ram, the petitioner had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of bus bearing registration no.HR-37-D-3975 by Gurpreet Singh, the respondent no.1. In Gurdeep Kaur Versus Tarsem Singh 2008(2) RCR (Civil) 775, it is held by Hon' ble Punjab and Haryana High Court that “if the driver is being tried on account of rash and negligent driving in a criminal case in a court of law, it is prima facie safe to hold that the CHHAJU RAM VERSUS GURPREET SINGH & OTHERS -7- accident occurred on account of his rash and negligent act. It is further held that in a claim petition under Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 the evidence should not be scrutinized in the manner as is done in a civil or in a criminal case. The proceedings before the Tribunal are of the nature of summary enquiry, whereas in a criminal case the rule is of proof beyond reasonable doubt and in a civil case the rule is of preponderance of probabilities. If there is some evidence before the claim Tribunal to prove a fact, no nicety, doubt or suspicion should weigh with it, in deciding a Motor Accident Claim case” . It is further held that “ Tribunal established under the Motor Vehicle Act, are not governed by the rules of procedure envisaged by the Civil Procedure Code and Tribunals are required to evolve their own procedure to meet the ends of justice, based on the principles of justice, equity and good conscience” . It is also held in Bimla Devi Versus Himachal Road Transport Corpn. And others AIR 2009 SC 2819 that “it is not possible to give strict proof of accident by the claimants and they have to establish their case merely on touchstone of preponderance of probability” . The injuries suffered by Chhaju Ram, the petitioner stand proved from MLR as Ex.P1 of General Hospital, Naraingarh, dated 19.01.2015, discharge and follow-up card as Ex.P5 of PGI, Chandigarh, placed on record. Though, respondent no.3 has taken plea of composite/contributory negligence, but did not lead any cogent evidence to establish the same. CHHAJU RAM VERSUS GURPREET SINGH & OTHERS -8- 10In view of the above discussion, it is proved that, Chhaju Ram, the petitioner had suffered injuries in the motor vehicular accident that had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of bus bearing registration no.HR-37-D-3975 by the respondent no.1. Consequently, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioner and against the respondents. Issue no.2: 11To ascertain the amount of compensation payable to Chhaju Ram, the claimant-petitioner, discussion is being made under following heads:- Medical expenses 12To prove this issue, Chhaju Ram, PW1, the petitioner has deposed by way of affidavit as Ex.PW1/A, tendered in his examination- in-chief reiterating the contents of petition. He has deposed that, he has already spent more than Rs.75,000/- on his treatment, special diet, transportation and more amount is likely to be spent in future on his further treatment. He has further deposed that he has not yet recovered fully and has become permanently disabled. During cross-examination, he has deposed that he was shifted from Civil Hospital, Naraingarh to PGI, Chandigarh and was discharged on 27.01.2015 and the same is evident from discharge and follow-up card as Ex.P5. He has placed on record bills/receipts as Ex.P10 to as Ex.P25 evidencing expenses CHHAJU RAM VERSUS GURPREET SINGH & OTHERS -9- incurred on his treatment to the tune of Rs.20,378/-. Some bills might have not been taken in haste in a bid to provide quick medical treatment or the same might have been lost in managing the patient more than in caring for the details such as collection and retention of the bills. Taking into account, such natural and usual lapse as also human failing, the medical expenses are taken to be Rs.20,378/- rounded off to Rs.21,000/-. This amount is allowed to the petitioner as compensation for medical expenses. Reference can also be made to Smt. Parsanni Versus Shri Sube Singh and another 2011(2) PLR 764 (P&H), wherein it is held that “production of the bills relating to the purchase of medicines during the period of hospitalization and oral evidence given by the party about purchasing of medicines ought to be taken as sufficient proof of authentication and admissibility of these documents”. It is further held that “a hospital document produced by a party which is duly authenticated must be taken as sufficient proof of the documents themselves and the requirement to produce the doctor for mere production of hospital documents must be immediately given up”. Pain and suffering 13Chhaju Ram, PW1, the petitioner had remained admitted in PGI, Chandigarh w.e.f. 20.01.2015 to 27.01.2015 as is evident from the discharge and follow-up card as Ex.P5. He had suffered multiple injuries including fracture in the said accident. There is no evidence on record to establish that he has suffered any disability due to the injuries sustained CHHAJU RAM VERSUS GURPREET SINGH & OTHERS -10- in the accident in question. The provisions of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, make it clear that, the award must be just, which means that compensation should, to the extent possible, fully and adequately restore the claimant to the position prior to the accident. The object of awarding damages is to make good the loss suffered as a result of wrong done as far as money can do so, in a fair, reasonable and equitable manner. Thus, the compensation should be reasonably sufficient so that it equips the victim to return to his normal life to the maximum possible extent. It was a time of travail and trauma. The petitioner must have been confined to bed for sufficiently long time and life would not have been the same for him. Hence, by approximation a sum of Rs.10,000/- is awarded as compensation to the claimant under this head. Reference can be made to Sri Laxman @ Laxman Mourya Versus Divisional Manager, Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. & another 2012(1) TAC 376 (SC), wherein, it has been held that “efforts should always be made to award adequate compensation, not only for the physical injury and treatment, but also for pain, suffering and trauma caused due to accident ”. Nutritious Diet 14Chhaju Ram, the injured/petitioner had remained admitted in PGI, Chandigarh, from 20.01.2015 to 27.10.2015 as mentioned above and was also operated upon.

Petitioner no.1 being widow, petitioners no.2 and 3 being minor children and petitioner no.4 being mother, of the deceased, claimed compensation to the tune of Rs.50,00,000/- alongwith interest at the rate of 18% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till realization.

It is submitted that no accident took place with truck bearing registration no.HP12C/3835 on 23.04.2015 and false FIR has been got registered. KA VITA & OTHERS VERSUS RAMESEH & OTHERS 4 On merits also, accident in question and involvement of truck in question has been denied. In the alternative, it is pleaded that deceased Satish Kumar might have succumbed to injuries in the accident by some unknown vehicle, number of which could not be noted down and truck of respondent no.2 has been falsely involved in connivance with police just to claim compensation. Denying all other averments, dismissal of claim petition was prayed for. 4.On notice, respondent no.3 appeared and filed written statement raising preliminary objections qua maintainability, hit and run case, respondent no.1 not having valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident, collusion etc. On merits, age, occupation and income of deceased are denied.

OPP 2.If issue no.1 is proved, then whether claimants are entitled to compensation, if so, how much and from whom?

OPR-3 4.Relief 6.In order to prove the case, petitioner Kavita Devi herself appeared as PW2 and examined Noor Deen as PW1. In documentary evidence, documents Ex.P1 to Ex.P4 were tendered. 7.On the other hand, respondent no.3 examined RW1 Jagpal. 8.Since respondents no.1 and 2 failed to lead any evidence despite sufficient opportunities, the same was closed by order of Court dated 13.9.2016. 9.In rebuttal, documents Mark A to Mark D were tendered. 10.Learned counsel for petitioners submitted that petitioners have duly proved that accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving truck number HP12C/3835 and FIR No.52 dated 23.4.2015 was registered after the accident and after completion of investigation, challan was filed. Ld. counsel further submitted that respondent no.1 has not appeared in this case as a witness and has not deposed that he was not driving the offending vehicle in rash and negligent manner. He further argued that PW1 has specifically deposed that respondent no.1 was KA VITA & OTHERS VERSUS RAMESEH & OTHERS 6 driving the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. Ld. counsel further submitted that issue no.2 has been proved by claimants by examining the witnesses and compensation be granted keeping in view the settled law. 11.On the other hand , learned counsel for respondents no.1 and 2 submitted that vehicle has been falsely implicated and no such accident had occurred with vehicle no.HP12C/3835. Ld. counsel for respondent no.3 has argued that PW1 had made contradictory statement before this Tribunal and he had not supported the case of the prosecution while appearing as PW1 in case titled as State versus Ramesh Rai. Learned counsel further submitted that it is clear from statement of PW1 that he has not witnessed the occurrence. He further submitted that that mere registration of FIR is not sufficient to conclude that accident was caused by respondent no.1 or he was driving the vehicle in rash and negligent manner. 12.After due consideration of the arguments and evidence of both parties, the findings on the above issues along with reasons for the decision are given below: Issue no.1: 13.Burden to prove this issue was upon petitioners. In order to prove their case, petitioners have examined Noor Deen, eye witness as PW1. In affidavit Ex.PW1/A, he deposed that on intervening night of 22/23.4.2015, he was present at Lovely Dhaba, N.H.73, Shahzadpur, where he is serving. He further deposed that around 3.40 AM, one Polo KA VITA & OTHERS VERSUS RAMESEH & OTHERS 7 Volkswagen car bearing temporary registration no.CH48T/5352 being driven by Satish Kumar at moderate speed on correct left side of road came from Barwala side and was going towards Shahzadpur-Ambala side and meanwhile, truck bearing registration No.HP12C/3835 came from Shahzadpur side, being driven by respondent no.1 in rashly and negligently and hit the car of Satish Kumar by coming on wrong side, resultantly Satish Kumar suffered fatal injuries and succumbed to injuries on the spot. He further deposed that occurrence was witnessed by him and one Shahrukh. He further deposed that autopsy on the body was conducted on the same day in Civil Hospital, Naraingarh. He further deposed that case against respondent no.1 was registered on his statement. In his cross-examination, he deposed that accident took place at a distance of about 150 yards from their dhaba, where he was doing work with other waiter Shahrukh at about 3.30/4.00 AM and they were busy in cleaning the Dhaba. He further deposed that they heard the noise and on reaching the spot, found that front side of the vehicles had struck against each other and vehicles were there till police reached. He deposed that his statement Ex.R1 was recorded by the police and site plan was prepared in his presence. 14.On perusal of the statement of PW1, it is clear that he was not an eye witness of the occurrence and on hearing noise of the accident, he had reached the spot after the accident. It is admitted fact that he had reached the spot after the occurrence of accident. This Tribunal is of the view that once he had not witnessed the accident, on the basis of mere his KA VITA & OTHERS VERSUS RAMESEH & OTHERS 8 statement, it cannot be held that respondent no.1 was driving truck number HP12C/3835 in a rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. This claim petition has been filed under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act and it was upon the claimants to prove that offending vehicle was being driven in a rash and negligent manner by its driver. 15.It is matter of record that after the accident, FIR No.52 dated 23.4.2015 for commission of offences punishable under sections 279, 304-A IPC Ex.P1 was registered in PS Shahzadpur and after investigation, police filed challan against respondent no.1. 16.During trial of the criminal case titled as 'State versus Ramesh Rai', Noor Deen appeared on 9.9.2015 as PW1. While appearing as PW1 in criminal case titled as State Versus Ramesh Rai, he had deposed in his cross-examination that accident had not occurred in his presence and he had not witnessed the occurrence. He specifically deposed that police had met him on the place of occurrence and police got his signatures on a paper, which was already written by police. He further deposed that police had not got his signatures on any other document except that paper. Statement of PW1 Noor Deen recorded in case titled as State versus Ramesh Rai is on record as Ex.R1. 17.However, while appearing as PW1 in present claim petition, he has deposed that he made statement Ex.R1, which is copy of the statement, which was got signed by police from him and on basis of the same, FIR No.52 dated 23.4.2015 Ex.P1 was recorded. Considering the fact that totally contradictory statement has been made by PW1 Noor KA VITA & OTHERS VERSUS RAMESEH & OTHERS 9 Deen in present claim petition and while appearing as PW1 in criminal case titled as State Versus Ramesh Rai, this Tribunal is of the view that PW1 Noor Deen is not a believable witness. Once it is admitted that he is not an eye-witness of the occurrence, he cannot depose that accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving the offending truck in a rash and negligent manner. 18.Admittedly, respondent no.1 is facing trial, but as held in the case of Geeta Devi and others vs. Ravinder Kumar and others, 2014 (11) RCR (Civil) 2090 , mere facing of trial is no ground to hold that accident is an outcome of rash and negligent driving of vehicle in question in absence of any other evidence. 19.In view of settled law, only on basis of the fact that respondent no.1 is facing trial, it can not be held that he was driving the vehicle in rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. PW1 Noor Deen, who is the only eye-witness, is not a believable witness, as there are vital contradictions in his statement. 20.Considering entire record of the case, this Tribunal is of the view that truck in question has been falsely implicated just to extract compensation. Accordingly, Issue No.1 is decided against petitioners. Issues no.2 and 3 : 21.In view of the findings recorded under issue no.1, issues no.2 and 3 have become redundant. Relief 22.In view of above discussion, present claim petition is KA VITA & OTHERS VERSUS RAMESEH & OTHERS 10 dismissed with costs. Counsel fee is assessed as Rs.2200/-. Memo of costs be prepared. File be consigned to record room. Pronounced/18.11.2016 (Narender Shura) Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ambala Note:All ten pages of this Award have been checked and signed by me.

HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 7 In this claim petition, compensation to the tune of Rs.5 lakh alongwith interest at the rate of 12% per annum from the date of accident till realization is claimed. 5.On notice, respondent no.1 appeared and filed written statement in main claim petition titled as Harpreet Singh versus Satpal Singh and another , by taking preliminary objections qua maintainability and suppression. It is averred that no accident, as alleged, had taken place with Car in question and a false FIR has been registered against answering respondent in collusion with police. It is further averred that there is delay of one day in lodging of FIR, which has not been properly explained. On merits, it is submitted that since no alleged accident had occurred, damage to motorcycle in question does not arise. Denying all other averments, dismissal of petition was prayed for. 6.On notice, respondent no.2 also appeared and filed written statement by taking preliminary objections regarding the petition being misconceived, vexatious, untenable and devoid of merit, collusion, respondent no.1 not having valid and effective driving licence, RC and fitness at the time of alleged accident and locus standi, were taken.

Denying all other averments, dismissal of the petition was prayed for. 7.In other connected petitions, separate written statements have HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 8 been filed. The stand of the respondents in these claim petitions is same regarding the accident and liability as taken by them in claim petition no.324 of 2015 titled as Harpreet Singh versus Satpal Singh and another . 8.All above mentioned three claim petitions were consolidated vide Order dated 13.5.2016 and from pleadings of parties, following issues were framed: 1.Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 while driving Car bearing registration no.HR54/8524 resulting into damage to motorcycle bearing no.HR54A/6181, injuries to Paramjeet Kaur and Harpreet Singh, as alleged? OPP 2.If issue no.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom, claimants are entitled? OPP 3.Whether respondent no.1 was driving the offending Car in violation of terms and conditions of Insurance Policy? OPR (2) 4.Relief 9.In order to prove their case, petitioner Paramjeet Kaur herself stepped as PW1, whereas claimant Harpreet Singh stepped as PW2. In documentary evidence, documents Ex.P1 to Ex.P58 were tendered. 10.On the other hand, only documents Ex.R1 to Ex.R3 were tendered on behalf of respondent no.1, whereas respondent no.2 led no oral or documentary evidence. 11.No rebuttal evidence was led. HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 9 12.I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the material pleadings, evidence and the legal proposition applicable to the present case. My findings on the above issues are as under:- Issue No.1: 13.To prove this issue, learned counsel for the petitioners took me to the testimony of PW1 Paramjeet Kaur and PW2 Harpreet Singh and contended that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving Car no.HR54/8524 in rash and negligent manner. 14.PW2 Harpreet Singh filed his affidavit Ex.PW2/A and specifically deposed that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 as he was driving Car no.HR54/8524 in rash and negligent manner at that time. He specifically deposed about the manner of accident and the rash and negligent driving on part of respondent no.1. PW1 Paramjeet Kaur corroborated the version of PW2 on the point of rash and negligent driving by respondent no.1 and the manner in which the accident was caused. PW1 and PW2 were cross examined at length, but there is nothing on record on the basis of which their statements can be disbelieved. 15.In regard to the accident, FIR no.131 dated 22.6.2015, P.S. Mullana, District Ambala (Ex.P48) was registered on the statement of PW2 Harpreet Singh. After investigation of case, final report under Section 173 Cr.P.C Ex.P57 was filed and respondent no.1 is facing trial. The respondent no.1 was the best witness, but for reasons best known to him, he failed to appear as witness to controvert the allegations levelled HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 10 against him that he was driving the offending vehicle bearing registration no.HR54/8524 in rash and negligent manner and caused the accident. In a situation, when respondent no.1-driver is facing criminal trial for having caused accident, it is safe to presume that it was due to his negligence that the accident had occurred. 16.Considering the above facts, this tribunal is of the view that the petitioners have successfully proved that this accident was caused by respondent no.1 while driving offending vehicle bearing registration no.HR54/8524 in rash and negligent manner. Hence, this issue is decided in favour of petitioners. Issue no.2 & 3: MACP No.324 of 2015 Harpreet Singh vs. Satpal Singh & another 17.This claim petition has been filed by petitioner claiming compensation of Rs.50,000/- on account of damage to his vehicle i.e. motor-cycle bearing registration no.HR54A/6181. Claimant appeared as PW2 and specifically deposed in his affidavit Ex.PW2/A that his motor- cycle bearing registration no.HR54A/6181, Make Splendor, Model 2012 was badly damaged. In his affidavit, he has not deposed about the amount spent on repair of his motor-cycle. In his cross-examination, he deposed that period of insurance policy of his motor-cycle expired about twenty days prior to this accident and his motor-cycle was not insured. He further deposed that he did not know if repair work of the engine was also done or not or whether engine HARPREET SINGH VERSUS SATPAL SINGH & ANOTHER 11 of his motor-cycle was damaged or not. 18.In order to support his claim, petitioner placed on record repair bills of motor-cycle Ex.P49 to Ex.P51, which shows that he spent Rs.29,186/-. As per Insurance Policy of motor-cycle Ex.R1, total value of the motor-cycle has been assessed as Rs.26,700/- for the purpose of calculating the premium. Even if it is taken that motor-cycle was totally damaged, even then he would have claimed Rs.26,700/-. On perusal of bills Ex.P49 to Ex.P51, it is clear that he had got changed some parts of the motor-cycle, which would not been damaged in the accident. It shows that he got changed all parts, which were not in working condition, presuming that Insurance Company will pay against the same. The claimant has not examined any Mechanical Expert or any person from Rekhi Motors, otherwise all things would have been cleared during cross- examination. Nothing is mentioned in bills Ex.P49 to Ex.P51 qua disposal of changed damaged parts of the vehicle nor value of such parts has not been deducted. He has simply placed on record the bills Ex.P49 to Ex.P51. 19.Considering the facts and insured value of the vehicle, this Tribunal is of the view that petitioner is not entitled to get whole of the amount shown in the bills Ex.P49 to Ex.P51. This Tribunal is of the view that petitioner is only entitled to Rs.20,000/- for damage of the vehicle. Accordingly, Rs.20,000/- is awarded to petitioner under the head of damage to vehicle.

My findings on various issues are as under: ISSUE NO.1: 11.According to Issue No.1, the petitioners are required to prove this fact that the accident occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of Canter bearing registration No.HR 37 C-8794 by Amrik Singh-respondent No.1 resulting into death of Manish Kumar. Rakesh Singh, MACT Sanjay Kumar etc. Vs. Amrik Singh etc. 7 12.In order to prove this issue the petitioners have examined Kunal Rana alias Rinku- eye witness as PW2 who in his affidavit Ex.PW2/A has stated that on 14.7.2015 during evening hours he was going to Mithapur Petrol Pump to fill petrol in his tractor and when at about 5 p.m. he reached near village Fulel Majra he saw his cousin brother namely Manish Kumar going towards his village Sambhalkha by driving his motor cycle bearing registration No.HR-06J-1491 on his correct left hand side of the road in a normal speed. In the meanwhile a canter bearing registration number HR 37C-8794 came from Sambhalkha side being driven by respondent no.1 rashly and negligently and struck with the motor cycle of the deceased straightly and dud to this impact of accident the deceased fell on the road along with motor cycle and suffered multiple fractures on his head and other injuries and he succumbed to the accidental injuries on the spot. He got shifted the deceased to General Hosptial, Ambala Cantt. With the help of passersby and the driver of the offending canter fled away from the place of occurrence after causing the accident. He noted down the number of the offending canter and got the accident case registered against the respondent no.1 for causing this accident. In his cross-examination he has stated on the date of incident he was going to Mithapur from his village Sabhalkha. Manish deceased did not accompany him from his village. The width of the road is wide enough to pass two vehicles together simultaneously. He has further stated that there was less traffic on the road at that time and Manish was coming Rakesh Singh, MACT Sanjay Kumar etc. Vs. Amrik Singh etc. 8 from the side of village Mithapur. The offending vehicle was coming from Sambhalkha side i.e. opposite direction. He could not tell the colour of the canter. He could not tell whether the canter was loaded or unloaded. He further stated that there was no traffic between canter and motor cycle and Manish was not overtaking any vehicle at that time and driver of the offending vehicle was also not overtaking any vehicle at that time. He has further stated that the accident took place on the road and Manish had fallen on the katcha portion of the road after the accident. He has further stated that police has recorded his statement at Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt and he had also visited the spot with the police after 2-3 days of the accident. PW3 Vikas Sharma-criminal Ahlmad has brought the record of the criminal case titled as State Vs. Amrik Singh bearing FIR No.95 dated 14.7.2015 under sections 279,304-A of IPC registered at P.S.Saha and has stated that case is now fixed for prosecution evidence for 9.5.2016 and accused Amrik Singh had been charge sheeted on 5.3.2016 for the commission of offence under sections 279/304-A of IPC. He has further stated that truck no.HR-37C-8794 was released on superdari by learned JMIC, Ambala on 24.7.2015 and accused Amrik Singh was arrested and was bailed out on 23.7.2015. In his cross-examination he has proved the RC of the offending vehicle Ex.R1, certificate of fitness of the above said vehicle Ex.R2, Authorisation certificate Ex.R3, Insurance cover note Ex.R4 and DL of Amrik Singh as Ex.R5. Rakesh Singh, MACT Sanjay Kumar etc. Vs. Amrik Singh etc. 9 PW1 Sanjay Kumar-claimant no.1 deposed on oath in his affidavit Ex.PW1/A that on 14.07.2015 during evening hours, his son namely Manish Kumar met with an road side accident when he was coming from village Mithapur towards his village Sabhalkha on his motor cycle bearing registration number HR-06-J-1491 in the area of police station Saha which was caused by respondent no.1 by driving the offending canter in a very rash and negligent manner and his son Manish Kumar was declared brought dead by the doctor. He has further deposed that motor cycle was badly damaged in this accident and the accident was witnessed by one Kunal Rana alias Rinku who himself noted the number of the offending canter and accident case against no.1 for causing this accident was registered on the statement of said Kunal Rana alias Rinku. He has further stated that after the accident his son was shifted to General Hospital, Ambala Cantt. where the doctor declared him brought dead and post mortem on his dead body was conducted on 15.7.2015.He has further stated that they have spent more than Rs.one lac on transportation, funeral and last rites of the deceased. 13.Thus, in the present case as per the statement of PW2 Kunal Rana alias Rinku- alleged eye witness and PW1 Sanajy Kumar-father of the deceased, the accident has taken place on 14.07.2015 and FIR was registered on the statement of PW2 Kunal Rana alias Rinku, who is an eye witness. The driver i.e. respondent no.1 Karam Singh was challaned and was facing trial as stated by PW3 Vikas Sharma, Criminal Ahlmad who has brought the record of case titled as State Vs. Amrik Singh. No Rakesh Singh, MACT Sanjay Kumar etc. Vs. Amrik Singh etc. 10 evidence in rebuttal was produced by the respondents. 14. In Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Sham and others 1993(2) PLR, 109 it has been held by our Hon'ble High Court that when the driver of the offending vehicle is facing a criminal trial prima facie it can be presumed that he was responsible for the accident. We have an eye witness in the shape of PW2 Kunal Rana @ Rinku and statement of eye witness has gone unrebutted. The driver is facing trial. The statement of PW2 Kunal Rana alias Rinku- eye witness has to be accepted as it has gone unchallenged. It would be safe to hold that accident has occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the Canter bearing registration no.HR-37C-8794 which was being driven by respondent no.1. Issue no.1 is answered in favour of the claimants to the effect that Manish Kumar has expired due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 while driving Canter bearing registration no.HR-37C-8794. ISSUE NO.2:- 15.To prove this issue the claimants have examined one of the claimant as PW1 Sanjay Kumar-father of the deceased, who has deposed that the deceased Manish Kumar was 22 years of age and was doing agriculture work on his 10 acres of agricultural land and he was also running his Electrical shop in the name of Manish Chauhan at Saharanpur and he was earning more than Rs.30,000/- per month by agricultural work and Rs.20,000/- per month by running electrical shop and thus he was total earning more than Rs.50,000/- per month. All the claimants were solely dependent upon the income of the deceased. Claimants no.1 and 2 Rakesh Singh, MACT Sanjay Kumar etc. Vs. Amrik Singh etc. 11 are his parents and claimants no.3 and 4 are his younger sister and brother. He has also stated that Rs.1,00,000/- were spent on the transportation, funeral and last rites of the deceased Manish Kumar. 16.Now the question arises to what amount of compensation the claimants are entitled to. With regard to the age of the deceased,the claimants have placed on record his secondary Examination Certificate Ex.P5 in which his date of birth is mentioned as 7.12.1993. Meaning thereby at the time of his death in the accident on 14.07.2015 he was about 21 years and 7 months of age. In the post mortem report Ex.P2 his age is mentioned as 23 years, in the ration card Ex.P3 his age is mentioned as 11 years in the year 2005. Meaning thereby he was about 21 years of age at the time of his death in the year 2015. Considering all these documents the age of the deceased is taken as about 21 years and 7 months keeping in view his school certificate because age mentioned in school certificate has to be preferred. Moreover, in the claim petition also the age of the deceased has been recorded as 21 years. Therefore, in view of the above said evidence the age of the deceased can be assumed as 22 years. 17Further more since the deceased was unmarried, therefore, the age of the parents of the deceased has to be seen in view of the judgment in case titled as Sarla Verma etc. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another, 2009 ACJ 1298 . In the ration card Ex.P3 the age of Sanjay Kumar-claimant no.1 is mentioned as 32 years in the year 2005. Meaning thereby he is now about 43 years. As per Aadhaar card Rakesh Singh, MACT Sanjay Kumar etc. Vs. Amrik Singh etc. 12 Ex.P4 the date of birth of claimant no.1 is 7.10.1972. Meaning thereby the age of claimant no.1, who is father of the deceased, is about 43 years. In the claim petition also the age of the claimant no.1 is also mentioned as 43 years. In the ration card age of claimant no.2 is mentioned as 31 years in the year 2005. Meaning thereby now she is about 42 years of age. In the claim petition also her age is mentioned as 42 years. Therefore, the age of claimant no.2, who is mother of the deceased, is now taken as 42 years. So according to the age of the mother of the deceased i.e. 42 years and as per Sarla Verma's case multiplier of '14' has to be applied. 18.To prove the income of deceased PW1 Sanjay Kumar, father of the deceased, has stated that deceased Manish Kumar was working as agriculturist and was running his Electrical shop and thus he was earning Rs.20,000/-+30,000/-=Rs.50,000/-per month from both these professions. In this regard he has placed on record documents Mark A to Mark C. 19 A perusal of Mark A to Mark C goes to show that all these documents are in the name of father of the deceased, therefore, these documents cannot be read towards the income of the deceased. Moreover, no document with regard to the factum that deceased was running electrical shop has been placed on record. Thus, in view of the above said evidence, I have no hesitation in holding that the claimants have failed to prove the fact that deceased was agriculturist and was running a electrical shop and was earning Rs.50,000/- per month, therefore the deceased has to be considered as a labourer and as per Deputy Commissioner's rate the income of the deceased is to be considered as Rs.6000/- per month. Rakesh Singh, MACT Sanjay Kumar etc. Vs. Amrik Singh etc. 13 20 As deceased was unmarried on the point of deduction towards his personal expenses the learned counsel for the claimants has argued that while awarding compensation 1/3rd deduction towards his personal expenses has to be made from the income of the deceased as assessed by this tribunal. In support of his argument he has placed reliance on case titled as Kamaljit Kaur & Ors. Vs. Pepsu Road Transport Corporation & Others I (2015) ACC 519 ( P& H) 519. 21On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent no.4 has opposed this contention of the learned counsel for the claimants and has submitted that where the deceased was unmarried a deduction of 50% towards the personal and living expenses is not to be disturbed. In support of his argument he has placed reliance on case titled as Munna Lal Jain and another Vs. Vipin Kumar Sharma and others 2015 (3) Local Acts Reporter 198 (SC), Sarla Verma Vs.

Amrik Singh etc. 14 his arguments deduction towards personal and living expenses to the extent of 1/3rd is concerned, the same is not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case. T herefore, in view of the law laid down in Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corp. and another, (2009) 6 SCC 121, there would be a deduction of 50% as contribution to the family. Thus, deducting 50% the amount available for the family would be Rs.3000/-per month. Annual contribution comes to Rs.3000x12=36000/-. By applying the multiplier of '14' the compensation works out to Rs.5,04,000/-. A sum of Rs.25,000/- should be added as transportation and cremation/funeral expenses. A sum of Rs. 1,00,000/- is awarded towards loss of love and affection. Thus, the total of this comes to Rs.6,29,000/-. 23.As per claimants, claimant no.1- father of deceased,claimant no.2 mother of the deceased and claimants no.3 and 4 sister and brother respectively of the deceased were dependent upon the income of deceased. Since claimant no.1 is the father of the deceased and claimants no.3 and 4 are the sister and brother respectively of the deceased, they are class IInd heir, therefore, it is held that they were not dependent upon his income. Thus, I am of the considered view that only claimant no.2- Neelam Chauhan -mother of the deceased, who is Ist class heir of the deceased, was dependent upon his income. 24.On account of above discussion, total compensation payable to the petitioner no.2 Neelam Chauhan-mother of the deceased works out to Rs.6,29,000/- (Rs. Six lac, Twenty Nine Thousand only).The claimant Rakesh Singh, MACT Sanjay Kumar etc. Vs. Amrik Singh etc. 15 no.2 shall also be held entitled to interest @ 7 ½% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition till its actual realisation. 25Now comes the question as to who inter-se the respondents is liable to make the payment of said compensation. 26Ex.R4/Ex.R6 is the Insurance Policy revealing that offending Canter was insured with respondent no.3 in the name of respondent no.2 for the period w.e.f. 16.07.2014 to 15.07.2015. This period covers the date of accident and as such, it is held that the respondents no.1 to 3 being the respective driver, owner & insurer of the offending vehicle are jointly and severally responsible to pay the compensation amount to the petitioner no.2 Neelam Chauhan, as assessed by this Tribunal. Issue no.2 is decided accordingly in the above mentioned terms. ISSUES NO.3 :- 27. In view of findings on issues no.1 and 2, the claim petition us very well maintainable. Therefore, this issue is decided against the respondents and in favour of the claimants. ISSUE NO.4 28.In order to escape from its liability, it is required for Insurance Company to prove violation of any terms and conditions of the policy on the part of insured i.e. respondent no.3. 29.It has been alleged by the Insurance Company that respondent No.1 i.e. driver was not holding a valid and effective driving licence. 30.Learned counsel for the respondent no.3 has placed on record Rakesh Singh, MACT Sanjay Kumar etc. Vs. Amrik Singh etc. 16 photocopies of Driving Licence of respondent no.1 as Ex.R5 which goes to show that the Driving licence held by respondent no.1 was valid from 29.1.1998 to 20.3.2017 and the same was issued by Licencing Authority, Ambala for M.C.with gear, LMV-Transport, TRV Rigid Chasi only. Ex.R4/Ex.R6 is the insurance policy of the offending vehicle which is valid from 16.07.2014 to 15.07.2015. Moreover, respondent no.3 has also failed to produce any evidence to show that respondent no.2-owner -insured of the offending canter violated any terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy. As such, it is held that Insurance Company cannot escape from its liability to pay compensation. As such, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.5 (RELIEF):- 31.As a sequel of above findings, the petition is hereby allowed partly with costs. 32.An award of Rs.6,29,000/- (Rs. Six lac, Twenty Nine Thousand only) is hereby passed in favour of the claimant no.2 Neelam Chauhan on account of the death of Manish Kumar- her son. 33.On this amount, she shall be entitled to interest at the rate of 7 ½% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition till actual realization. However, the petitioners no.1,3 and 4 being the father, sister and brother of the deceased, who are class IInd heir and were not dependent upon his income, are not entitled for any amount of compensation.

My findings on various issues are as under: ISSUE NO.1: 11.According to Issue No.1, the petitioners are required to prove this fact that the accident occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of Canter bearing registration No.HR 37 C-8794 by Amrik Singh-respondent No.1 resulting into death of Manish Kumar. Rakesh Singh, MACT Sanjay Kumar etc. Vs. Amrik Singh etc. 7 12.In order to prove this issue the petitioners have examined Kunal Rana alias Rinku- eye witness as PW2 who in his affidavit Ex.PW2/A has stated that on 14.7.2015 during evening hours he was going to Mithapur Petrol Pump to fill petrol in his tractor and when at about 5 p.m. he reached near village Fulel Majra he saw his cousin brother namely Manish Kumar going towards his village Sambhalkha by driving his motor cycle bearing registration No.HR-06J-1491 on his correct left hand side of the road in a normal speed. In the meanwhile a canter bearing registration number HR 37C-8794 came from Sambhalkha side being driven by respondent no.1 rashly and negligently and struck with the motor cycle of the deceased straightly and dud to this impact of accident the deceased fell on the road along with motor cycle and suffered multiple fractures on his head and other injuries and he succumbed to the accidental injuries on the spot. He got shifted the deceased to General Hosptial, Ambala Cantt. With the help of passersby and the driver of the offending canter fled away from the place of occurrence after causing the accident. He noted down the number of the offending canter and got the accident case registered against the respondent no.1 for causing this accident. In his cross-examination he has stated on the date of incident he was going to Mithapur from his village Sabhalkha. Manish deceased did not accompany him from his village. The width of the road is wide enough to pass two vehicles together simultaneously. He has further stated that there was less traffic on the road at that time and Manish was coming Rakesh Singh, MACT Sanjay Kumar etc. Vs. Amrik Singh etc. 8 from the side of village Mithapur. The offending vehicle was coming from Sambhalkha side i.e. opposite direction. He could not tell the colour of the canter. He could not tell whether the canter was loaded or unloaded. He further stated that there was no traffic between canter and motor cycle and Manish was not overtaking any vehicle at that time and driver of the offending vehicle was also not overtaking any vehicle at that time. He has further stated that the accident took place on the road and Manish had fallen on the katcha portion of the road after the accident. He has further stated that police has recorded his statement at Civil Hospital, Ambala Cantt and he had also visited the spot with the police after 2-3 days of the accident. PW3 Vikas Sharma-criminal Ahlmad has brought the record of the criminal case titled as State Vs. Amrik Singh bearing FIR No.95 dated 14.7.2015 under sections 279,304-A of IPC registered at P.S.Saha and has stated that case is now fixed for prosecution evidence for 9.5.2016 and accused Amrik Singh had been charge sheeted on 5.3.2016 for the commission of offence under sections 279/304-A of IPC. He has further stated that truck no.HR-37C-8794 was released on superdari by learned JMIC, Ambala on 24.7.2015 and accused Amrik Singh was arrested and was bailed out on 23.7.2015. In his cross-examination he has proved the RC of the offending vehicle Ex.R1, certificate of fitness of the above said vehicle Ex.R2, Authorisation certificate Ex.R3, Insurance cover note Ex.R4 and DL of Amrik Singh as Ex.R5. Rakesh Singh, MACT Sanjay Kumar etc. Vs. Amrik Singh etc. 9 PW1 Sanjay Kumar-claimant no.1 deposed on oath in his affidavit Ex.PW1/A that on 14.07.2015 during evening hours, his son namely Manish Kumar met with an road side accident when he was coming from village Mithapur towards his village Sabhalkha on his motor cycle bearing registration number HR-06-J-1491 in the area of police station Saha which was caused by respondent no.1 by driving the offending canter in a very rash and negligent manner and his son Manish Kumar was declared brought dead by the doctor. He has further deposed that motor cycle was badly damaged in this accident and the accident was witnessed by one Kunal Rana alias Rinku who himself noted the number of the offending canter and accident case against no.1 for causing this accident was registered on the statement of said Kunal Rana alias Rinku. He has further stated that after the accident his son was shifted to General Hospital, Ambala Cantt. where the doctor declared him brought dead and post mortem on his dead body was conducted on 15.7.2015.He has further stated that they have spent more than Rs.one lac on transportation, funeral and last rites of the deceased. 13.Thus, in the present case as per the statement of PW2 Kunal Rana alias Rinku- alleged eye witness and PW1 Sanajy Kumar-father of the deceased, the accident has taken place on 14.07.2015 and FIR was registered on the statement of PW2 Kunal Rana alias Rinku, who is an eye witness. The driver i.e. respondent no.1 Karam Singh was challaned and was facing trial as stated by PW3 Vikas Sharma, Criminal Ahlmad who has brought the record of case titled as State Vs. Amrik Singh. No Rakesh Singh, MACT Sanjay Kumar etc. Vs. Amrik Singh etc. 10 evidence in rebuttal was produced by the respondents. 14. In Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Sham and others 1993(2) PLR, 109 it has been held by our Hon'ble High Court that when the driver of the offending vehicle is facing a criminal trial prima facie it can be presumed that he was responsible for the accident. We have an eye witness in the shape of PW2 Kunal Rana @ Rinku and statement of eye witness has gone unrebutted. The driver is facing trial. The statement of PW2 Kunal Rana alias Rinku- eye witness has to be accepted as it has gone unchallenged. It would be safe to hold that accident has occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the Canter bearing registration no.HR-37C-8794 which was being driven by respondent no.1. Issue no.1 is answered in favour of the claimants to the effect that Manish Kumar has expired due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 while driving Canter bearing registration no.HR-37C-8794. ISSUE NO.2:- 15.To prove this issue the claimants have examined one of the claimant as PW1 Sanjay Kumar-father of the deceased, who has deposed that the deceased Manish Kumar was 22 years of age and was doing agriculture work on his 10 acres of agricultural land and he was also running his Electrical shop in the name of Manish Chauhan at Saharanpur and he was earning more than Rs.30,000/- per month by agricultural work and Rs.20,000/- per month by running electrical shop and thus he was total earning more than Rs.50,000/- per month. All the claimants were solely dependent upon the income of the deceased. Claimants no.1 and 2 Rakesh Singh, MACT Sanjay Kumar etc. Vs. Amrik Singh etc. 11 are his parents and claimants no.3 and 4 are his younger sister and brother. He has also stated that Rs.1,00,000/- were spent on the transportation, funeral and last rites of the deceased Manish Kumar. 16.Now the question arises to what amount of compensation the claimants are entitled to. With regard to the age of the deceased,the claimants have placed on record his secondary Examination Certificate Ex.P5 in which his date of birth is mentioned as 7.12.1993. Meaning thereby at the time of his death in the accident on 14.07.2015 he was about 21 years and 7 months of age. In the post mortem report Ex.P2 his age is mentioned as 23 years, in the ration card Ex.P3 his age is mentioned as 11 years in the year 2005. Meaning thereby he was about 21 years of age at the time of his death in the year 2015. Considering all these documents the age of the deceased is taken as about 21 years and 7 months keeping in view his school certificate because age mentioned in school certificate has to be preferred. Moreover, in the claim petition also the age of the deceased has been recorded as 21 years. Therefore, in view of the above said evidence the age of the deceased can be assumed as 22 years. 17Further more since the deceased was unmarried, therefore, the age of the parents of the deceased has to be seen in view of the judgment in case titled as Sarla Verma etc. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another, 2009 ACJ 1298 . In the ration card Ex.P3 the age of Sanjay Kumar-claimant no.1 is mentioned as 32 years in the year 2005. Meaning thereby he is now about 43 years. As per Aadhaar card Rakesh Singh, MACT Sanjay Kumar etc. Vs. Amrik Singh etc. 12 Ex.P4 the date of birth of claimant no.1 is 7.10.1972. Meaning thereby the age of claimant no.1, who is father of the deceased, is about 43 years. In the claim petition also the age of the claimant no.1 is also mentioned as 43 years. In the ration card age of claimant no.2 is mentioned as 31 years in the year 2005. Meaning thereby now she is about 42 years of age. In the claim petition also her age is mentioned as 42 years. Therefore, the age of claimant no.2, who is mother of the deceased, is now taken as 42 years. So according to the age of the mother of the deceased i.e. 42 years and as per Sarla Verma's case multiplier of '14' has to be applied. 18.To prove the income of deceased PW1 Sanjay Kumar, father of the deceased, has stated that deceased Manish Kumar was working as agriculturist and was running his Electrical shop and thus he was earning Rs.20,000/-+30,000/-=Rs.50,000/-per month from both these professions. In this regard he has placed on record documents Mark A to Mark C. 19 A perusal of Mark A to Mark C goes to show that all these documents are in the name of father of the deceased, therefore, these documents cannot be read towards the income of the deceased. Moreover, no document with regard to the factum that deceased was running electrical shop has been placed on record. Thus, in view of the above said evidence, I have no hesitation in holding that the claimants have failed to prove the fact that deceased was agriculturist and was running a electrical shop and was earning Rs.50,000/- per month, therefore the deceased has to be considered as a labourer and as per Deputy Commissioner's rate the income of the deceased is to be considered as Rs.6000/- per month. Rakesh Singh, MACT Sanjay Kumar etc. Vs. Amrik Singh etc. 13 20 As deceased was unmarried on the point of deduction towards his personal expenses the learned counsel for the claimants has argued that while awarding compensation 1/3rd deduction towards his personal expenses has to be made from the income of the deceased as assessed by this tribunal. In support of his argument he has placed reliance on case titled as Kamaljit Kaur & Ors. Vs. Pepsu Road Transport Corporation & Others I (2015) ACC 519 ( P& H) 519. 21On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent no.4 has opposed this contention of the learned counsel for the claimants and has submitted that where the deceased was unmarried a deduction of 50% towards the personal and living expenses is not to be disturbed. In support of his argument he has placed reliance on case titled as Munna Lal Jain and another Vs. Vipin Kumar Sharma and others 2015 (3) Local Acts Reporter 198 (SC), Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation 2009 ACJ 1300, New India Assurance Company Ltd. Vs. Hukam Chand and others FAO No.4709 of 2010 decided on 14.1.2015 by the Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court, Chandigarh, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Smt. Santosh and others FAO No.2962 of 2012 decided on 05.11.2014 by the Hon'ble Punjab & Haryana High Court, Chandigarh. 22Having due regards to the contentions raised by learned counsel for the parties, as far as the authority Kamaljit Kaur & Ors. Vs. Pepsu Road Transport Corporation & Others I (2015) ACC 519 ( P& H) 519 (supra), cited by learned counsel for the claimants with regard to Rakesh Singh, MACT Sanjay Kumar etc. Vs. Amrik Singh etc. 14 his arguments deduction towards personal and living expenses to the extent of 1/3rd is concerned, the same is not applicable in the facts and circumstances of the present case. T herefore, in view of the law laid down in Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corp. and another, (2009) 6 SCC 121, there would be a deduction of 50% as contribution to the family. Thus, deducting 50% the amount available for the family would be Rs.3000/-per month. Annual contribution comes to Rs.3000x12=36000/-. By applying the multiplier of '14' the compensation works out to Rs.5,04,000/-. A sum of Rs.25,000/- should be added as transportation and cremation/funeral expenses. A sum of Rs. 1,00,000/- is awarded towards loss of love and affection. Thus, the total of this comes to Rs.6,29,000/-. 23.As per claimants, claimant no.1- father of deceased,claimant no.2 mother of the deceased and claimants no.3 and 4 sister and brother respectively of the deceased were dependent upon the income of deceased. Since claimant no.1 is the father of the deceased and claimants no.3 and 4 are the sister and brother respectively of the deceased, they are class IInd heir, therefore, it is held that they were not dependent upon his income. Thus, I am of the considered view that only claimant no.2- Neelam Chauhan -mother of the deceased, who is Ist class heir of the deceased, was dependent upon his income. 24.On account of above discussion, total compensation payable to the petitioner no.2 Neelam Chauhan-mother of the deceased works out to Rs.6,29,000/- (Rs. Six lac, Twenty Nine Thousand only).The claimant Rakesh Singh, MACT Sanjay Kumar etc. Vs. Amrik Singh etc. 15 no.2 shall also be held entitled to interest @ 7 ½% per annum from the date of filing of the claim petition till its actual realisation. 25Now comes the question as to who inter-se the respondents is liable to make the payment of said compensation. 26Ex.R4/Ex.R6 is the Insurance Policy revealing that offending Canter was insured with respondent no.3 in the name of respondent no.2 for the period w.e.f. 16.07.2014 to 15.07.2015. This period covers the date of accident and as such, it is held that the respondents no.1 to 3 being the respective driver, owner & insurer of the offending vehicle are jointly and severally responsible to pay the compensation amount to the petitioner no.2 Neelam Chauhan, as assessed by this Tribunal. Issue no.2 is decided accordingly in the above mentioned terms. ISSUES NO.3 :- 27. In view of findings on issues no.1 and 2, the claim petition us very well maintainable. Therefore, this issue is decided against the respondents and in favour of the claimants. ISSUE NO.4 28.In order to escape from its liability, it is required for Insurance Company to prove violation of any terms and conditions of the policy on the part of insured i.e. respondent no.3. 29.It has been alleged by the Insurance Company that respondent No.1 i.e. driver was not holding a valid and effective driving licence. 30.Learned counsel for the respondent no.3 has placed on record Rakesh Singh, MACT Sanjay Kumar etc. Vs. Amrik Singh etc. 16 photocopies of Driving Licence of respondent no.1 as Ex.R5 which goes to show that the Driving licence held by respondent no.1 was valid from 29.1.1998 to 20.3.2017 and the same was issued by Licencing Authority, Ambala for M.C.with gear, LMV-Transport, TRV Rigid Chasi only. Ex.R4/Ex.R6 is the insurance policy of the offending vehicle which is valid from 16.07.2014 to 15.07.2015. Moreover, respondent no.3 has also failed to produce any evidence to show that respondent no.2-owner -insured of the offending canter violated any terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy. As such, it is held that Insurance Company cannot escape from its liability to pay compensation. As such, this issue is decided in favour of the petitioners and against the respondents. ISSUE NO.5 (RELIEF):- 31.As a sequel of above findings, the petition is hereby allowed partly with costs. 32.An award of Rs.6,29,000/- (Rs.

SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 2 -.- Present:- Shri Akhil Gupta, counsel for the petitioners. Shri Gurmeet Singh, counsel for the respondent No.1 & 2. Shri R. K. Vig, counsel for the respondent No.3. AWARD:- Petitioners have brought t he instant petition 'under Section 166 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, for claiming compensation of Rs.20,00,000/- along with interest @ 18% per annum, on account of death of Sh. Rishi Pal, with loss of love and affection, consortium and loss of livelihood etc, who died in a road side accident which took place on 09.03.2015 at about 8.30 P.M, within the area of Police Station Naraingarh, due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 by Tractor bearing Registration No. PB-23-A-7233 . A case under sections 279, 304-A IPC was registered at Police Station Naraingarh vide FIR No. 52 dated 10.03.2015 against the respondent No.1. The postmortem of dead body was conducted at Civil Hospital Naraingarh. At the time of his death, his age was 42 years and he was earning Rs.25,000/- per month from the agriculture and dairy milk and all claimants being widow, daughter, son and mother were fully dependent upon the income of the deceased. 2The necessary facts relating to accident are that on 09.03.2015, Rishi Pal (since deceased) was going on his motorcycle bearing registration No.HR-04-E-4321 Marka Discover, towards his Village Ganauli and at about 8.30 PM, when he was on its correct side on the road, then just ahead a tractor trolley was going, which was coming SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 3 from Sadhaura to Naraingarh side and its driver was driving his tractor in a in a rash, negligent and zig-zag manner; motorcyclist tried to over take his motorcycle, in the mean time, the driver of the tractor trolley turned his tractor into right side and hit the motorcycle and due to this impact, the motorcyclist received multiple and grievous injuries. This accident was witnessed by Pawan Kumar, who was also proceeding towards the village. After the said accident, motorcyclist was taken to civil Hospital Naraingarh, from where, he was referred to PGI Chandigarh but on the way he died due to the injuries sustained in the accident. The accident took place due to sole rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1/ driver of Tractor bearing Registration No. PB-23-7277. It is further pleaded that deceased was only sole bread earner of his family. Due to his untimely death, claimants No.2 and 3 being daughter and son {who are students} also deprived from the love and affection of their father. After the death of deceased, whole family members have no source of income. The claimants spent more than Rs,50,000/- on funeral and last rites of the deceased. Hence, the instant claim petition without any delay . At the relevant time, the offending vehicle in question was owned by respondent no.2, and was insured with the respondent No.3. 3Upon notice, respondent No.1 and 2 filed written statement controverting the assertions made in the petition. They took preliminary objection qua maintainability. On merits, it is submitted that the alleged accident has not been caused by the respondent, who is having valid SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 4 driving licence and the respondent No.1 is an experienced driver having experience of about 20 years; that false FIR has been registered against the respondent No.1; that if this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the accident was caused by the respondent No.1, then the tractor in question was insured with respondent No.3, who is responsible to pay the compensation. The compensation claimed is highly excessive and the claimants are not entitled to any compensation. Rest of averments raised in the petition are denied and prayed for dismissal of instant claim petition with special costs. 4The respondent No.3 (insurance company) filed separate written statement controverting the assertions made in the petition and took some preliminary objections qua maintainability, cause of action; that the claim petition is bad by the principle of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence, that petition is bad for mis joinder and non joinder of necessary parties; that petition has been filed with malafide intention and in collusion with respondents No.1 and 2 only to extract compensation from the answering respondent; that respondent No.1 was not having valid and effective driving licence at the time of alleged accident and has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy; that respondents No.1 and 2 be directed to produce the original aforesaid documents; that answering respondent takes all the pleas available under sections 147 (2) , 148, 149 (2), 167, 169 & 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act. On merit, it is submitted that the tractor/trolley No. PB-23-A-7577 was never involved in any accident. However, the insurance particular of the SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 5 vehicle in question has not been verified from the issuing authority, so it is not admitted but the liability of insurance company, if any subject to the provisions of the M.V . Act and also terms and conditions thereof. It is denied that deceased suffered multiple grievous injuries and died on 10.03.2015 due to this accident. The amount claimed as compensation is much more exaggerated and imaginary one and they were not dependent upon the income of the deceased. No such accident has taken place. The FIR was registered by manipulating the wrong facts in order to get huge compensation from the answering respondent. The actual cause of accident has been suppressed. The claim petition has been filed after due consultation just to get compensation from the answering respondent on purely made up basis which is not sustainable in the eyes of law. The amount spent on transportation or last rites is also denied. The age and prospective income of the deceased also denied. Rests of facts are denied and prayed for dismissal of claim petition with special costs. 5Based upon the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed vide order dated 26.03.2015:- 1Whether the accident took place due to the rash and negligent driving of the respondent no.1 while driving tractor bearing Registration No. PB-23-A-7277 resulting into causing death of Rishi Pal, as alleged? OPP. 2If Issue No.1 is proved, to what amount of compensation and from whom, the claimants are entitled to? OPP. 3Whether petition is not maintainable in the present form? OPR. 4Whether the claimants have no cause of action to file SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 6 the present petition ?OPR 5Whether petition is bad by the principles of estoppel, waiver and acquiescence ? OPR 6Whether petition is bad for non joinder and mis joinder of necessary parties? OPR. 7Whether respondent no.1 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy, if so, its effect? OPR. 8Whether respondent no.3 is entitled to take all the defences available to it under the M.V . Act ? OPR. 9Relief. 6 To establish their claim through this inquiry, petitioners examined one of the claimant Smt. Sunita (widow of deceased) as PW1 who tendered affidavit Ex.PW1/A reiterating the averments raised in the petition. In cross-examination, she answered that she is a house hold lady. Her marriage was solemnized with Rishi Pal on 30.11.1993. She was 20 years old at the time of marriage. Her husband was 2 years elder to her. Her children had passed B.A. The date of birth of her children is 31.08.1994. Motorcycle was in the name of her husband. Her husband was having driving licence, but she cannot tell about the issuing authority of the same. She does not know whether her husband was income tax payee or not. They have their own house. She is having Ration card, voter card and Aadhar Card of said address. She has not brought the proof regarding date of birth of her husband. She has not possessed any document regarding income of her husband for Rs.25,000/- by doing agriculture and dairy farming. She is not eye witness. PW2 Kulwinder Singh, Additional Ahlmad, has brought the summoned file and SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 7 produced the documents i.e Statement of Pawan Kumar as Ex.P1, Photo copy of site plan as Ex.P2, Seizure form dated 10.03.2015 as Ex.P3, supplementary statement of Pawan Kumar as Ex.P4, Mechanical report of accidental vehicles as Ex.P5 and Ex.P6, photo copy of postmortem report of Rishi Pal as Ex.P7, attested copy of FIR as Ex.P8. In cross- examination, he answered that original RC of vehicle No. PN-23-A-7277 was already attached with another case file titled as State Vs. Nasib FIR No.133 dated 17.06.2014 under sections 279, 337 and 304-A IPC PS Naraingarh as per report of Criminal Ahlmad dated 12.03.2015. Accused Nasib Singh was arrested and bailed out on 12.03.2015. No DL of Nasib Singh was on the case file as per list of documents attached with the challan. He has no personal knowledge about this case. PW3 Pawan Kumar (Complainant-eye witness of accident) tendered affidavit Ex.PW3/A supporting the version of accident. In cross- examination, he answered that Rishi Pal was his real brother. They both started their journey from Village Ganauli to their village on separate motorcycles. His brother was ahead to him at a distance of 100-150 yards. The road was a single road having 20 feet width. It was dark night and there was no traffic on the road at that time. He was driving motorcycle at the speed of 40 KMPH and his brother was driving his motorcycle at the speed of 45 KMPH. His brother was not overtaking any other vehicle at that time. The tractor trolley was empty. There was no crossing or the chowk near the place of occurrence. His brother had already crossed the half portion of tractor trolley. Self stated the driver of tractor trolley SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 8 suddenly turned his vehicle towards right side. There was no traffic coming from opposite side. Many people had gathered at the spot after the accident. There is a police Naka near the place of occurrence. Police had recorded his statement at Civil Hospital Naraingarh. Self stated police had also recorded his supplementary statement on 10.03.2015. After recording his statement with police he went police station twice in connection with this case. Learned counsel for claimants has also tendered documents i.e copy of Ration card as Ex.P9, copy of Aadhar Card of Sunita as Ex.P10, Copy of Aadhar Card of Smt. Shakuntla as Ex.P11, Copy of Aadhar Card of Abhishek Saini as Ex.P12 and Copy of Aadhar Card of Aanchal Saini as Ex.P13 and closed his evidence. On the other hand, respondents No.1 and 2 have tendered documents i.e copy of DL as Ex.R1, Copy of RC as Ex.R2, Copy of insurance policy as Ex.R3 and closed their evidence, whereas counsel for respondent No.3 has tendered copy of insurance policy as Ex.R4 and closed his evidence. 7I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case file very carefully. My findings on various issues are as under: ISSUE NO.1: 8 Under this issue, claimants-petitioners are required to establish fact that motor vehicular accident was occurred 'due to sole rash and negligent driving of Respondent no.1, resulting death of Rishi Pal and as such, they being dependents are entitled to appropriate compensation from SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 9 respondents who are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation amount. 9 Learned counsel for the petitioners has submitted that accident in question was taken place due to sole rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1, resulting death of Rishi Pal, therefore, respondent No.1, driver, respondent No.2 owner and respondent no.3 insurer, are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the petitioners and prayed for allowing the petition. 10 On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent no.1&2 has submitted that no such accident, as alleged, was ever taken place with the involvement of offending vehicle, thus, no negligence could be attributed to the respondent No.1, in this view of the matter, no liability can be fastened upon respondent No 1&2 to pay any compensation to the petitioners. He further argued that for the sake of discussion if accident was taken place 'though not admitted, even then Respondent no.1 was holding valid license EX.R1 at the day of alleged accident and offending vehicle was also insured with respondent no.3, therefore, respondent no.3 is liable to indemnify the insured and prayed for dismissal the petition against them. 11 Learned counsel for respondent no.3 has submitted that no such accident, as alleged, was ever taken place with the involvement of offending vehicle, rather, petitioners in collusion with respondent no.1&2 got lodged false and frivolous FIR EX.P8 and so no liability can be fastened upon respondent no.3. He further argued that claimants did not SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 10 disclose the exact date of birth of deceased to claim excess compensation, rather if PW1 was married in the year 1993 and her husband was elder than 2 years, then age of deceased was more than 42 years and prayed for dismissal the petition. 12 I have given due regard to the rival contentions put forth by learned counsel for respective parties and have evaluated entire oral evidence coupled with documentary evidence carefully. After thorough examination, it is observed that the petitioners-claimants have come to the Court with categorical stand that accident was taken place due to rash and negligent driving of Tractor-Trolley No. PB-23-A-7277 Marka HMT-5911 by Respondent No.1, resulting death of Rishi Pal on 10.03.2015. In order to prove this issue, PW3{complainant-eye witness of accident} tendered affidavit Ex.PW3/A stating therein factum of accident. He deposed that he is an agriculturist and they are three brothers and two sisters and all are married. The marriage of their sister's daughter was to be solemnized on 10.3.2015. On 09.3.2015 he along with Rishi Pal was coming on their motorcycle from Todarpur- Sadhaura-fields, after finishing the work to their village Ganauli. At about 8.30 PM, deceased was ahead about 150 Meter and was on his motorcycle and he was plying the motorcycle on normal speed and just ahead a tractor trolley was going in a rash and negligent manner, which was coming from Sadhaura to Naraingarh side and the driver of Tractor No. PB-23-A-7277 Marka HMT-5911 was driving his vehicle in a zig-zag manner and when his brother tried to over- take motorcycle, in the mean time, the driver of the tractor trolley turned SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 11 his tractor into right side and hit the motorcycle of his brother and due to this impact, his brother received multiple and grievous injuries on his person. He further deposed that there was a police barricade {Naka} near to the place of accident and with the help of police officials, his brother was taken to G.H. Naraingarh in a private vehicle and thereafter the driver of tractor trolley stayed for some time and thereafter due to darkness he fled from the spot after leaving the tractor trolley. The doctor of G.H. Naraingarh referred his brother to PGI Chandigarh but on the way to PGI his brother was succumbed to injuries sustained in the accident. He categorically deposed that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the respondent No.1. PW1 Sunita {who is the widow of deceased Rishi Pal} tendered affidavit Ex.PW1/A reiterating the facts relating to question of dependency and income of her husband. PW2 has brought the summoned case file titled as State Vs Nasib Singh bearing FIR No. 52 dated 10.03.2015 under sections 279, 304-A IPC, P.S. Naraingarh. He stated that case is pending on 18.12.2015 for prosecution evidence. PW1 to PW3 were cross examined, however, nothing can be elicited disbelieving factum of motor vehicular accident. 13 It would be relevant to point out here that mere denial of rash and negligence after causing accident resulting death of male member, at the behest of respondents, are not found sufficient at all, rather, if there was no rash and negligent act at behest of driver, then driver/respondent no.1, could easily appear in the witness box to rebut the stand taken by claimants-petitioners. However, no reason has been assigned by the owner SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 12 and insurance company for non-examination of the driver of vehicle. In accident cases, it is necessary to have the first hand report from the driver. It may be that the driver does not always speak the truth, but the driver's version is the one which is to be given the best consideration. He also knows that as to what actually happened and if the driver has not been examined, then an adverse inference must be drawn against him. To that effect, reliance can be placed on ruling Raju and others versus Sukhvinder Singh and others, 2006(4)RCR(civil) 82 (P&H) . 14It is quite well settled that the lodging of the first information report is not an essential prerequisite for claiming compensation arising from a motor accident. Each case has to be seen on its own facts and circumstances. The Tribunal is expected to adjudge a case on the basis of the evidence adduced without giving too much of importance to the outcome of the criminal trial. It is, indeed, a settled position of law that the burden of proof is different in a criminal trial and in civil cases. It must be remembered that in a motor accident claim, the claimants are not required to prove their case beyond reasonable shadow of doubt. It is trite law that claimants-petitioners are required to prove its case, which sets up the particular case relating to the accident which was caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle. Once this fact is established, the burden shifts upon the respondents to show that the accident did not happen in the way alleged by the claimants. The provisions with regard to claim under the Act are enacted keeping in view the social welfare of the justice to the community and whenever incident of SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 13 vehicular accident takes place and circumstances are proved, then the claimants are always entitled for compensation irrespective whether the police has registered the offence regarding the incident or not because no claim case can be left over on the mercy of the police. 15 The evidence proved on record irrefutably leads to the inference in terms of unrebutted evidence at the instance of petitioners that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle by respondent No.1, resulting death of Rishi Pal and respondent No.1 has been facing trial under section 279 and 304 A, therefore, in view of case law laid down in Girdhari Lal versus Radhay Shyam, 1993 (2) P.L.R. 109 and Gurdeep Kaur versus Tarsem Singh, 2008 (2) R.C.R. (Civil) 774, it can be safely held that the accident in question took place due to sole rash and negligent driving by respondent No.1. Accordingly, this issue no.1 is decided in favour of the claimants. ISSUE NO. 2: 16The onus to prove this issue is upon claimants. It is undisputed that deceased was married and died leaving behind his wife, one son, one daughter and old aged mother. The deceased was enjoying very good health and physique. Here, PW1 categorically stated that all claimants were fully dependent upon income of deceased but due to untimely death of their only bread earner in his prime age of 42 years, they all have deprived from their source of income and also suffered mental shock and agony. PW1 also stated that they have spent Rs.50,000/- on transportation of dead body and funeral/ last rites of her deceased SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 14 husband. 17 Coming to question of age of deceased; according to postmortem report EX.P7, the age of deceased is shown as 42 years. However, claimants have furnished Adhaar Cards of all claimants as EX.P/10 to EX.P/13 but it is not understandable as to why adhaar card of deceased has not brought on record to show his exact date of birth of deceased. However, in order to surface the truth, claimant's counsel was directed to produce Adhaar Card who tendered the same. Copy of Adhar Card reflects date of birth of deceased as 01.01.1972 and so it can be safely said that age of deceased was between 42-45 years at the time of death and so multiplier of 14 can be applied. 18 Coming to question of income of deceased; though, claimants- petitioners pleaded that deceased was earning Rs.25,000/- per month. If deceased was earning Rs. 25,000/- per month, then, claimants-petitioners were required to produce relevant documents to establish his income, however, claimants-petitioners have entirely failed to establish exact income of deceased and so oral statement of PW1 without supporting any documentary proof of income, is not found sufficient at all. More so, if deceased was working as agriculturist and was doing dairy farming work, even then, his monthly income as a daily wager/ skilled labourer cannot assessed less than Rs.8000/- per month as just compensation. However, agriculture land shall remain as it is and legal heirs shall inherit the same and they can easily earn income from that property. It may not be out of place to mention here that the monetary compensation will never SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 15 be a sufficient succor for victims of accidental cases rather their needs can only be prevented by providing just compensation and it can not be cured. The best manner in which victims can be compensated for sufferings only to prevent recurrence of any such road incident by wrongdoer. In failure to protect or prevent an sufferings of victims due to death of their sole bread earner in road accident, it also imposes liability of state to take extra ordinary precaution to reduce such type of road accident by deputing sufficient traffic police or to comply with strict traffic rules to avoid such incident. It will certainly take lot of time for rehabilitation by the family members of deceased. Apart from this, widow of deceased has no source of income to maintain and to survive herself and family except agricultural land. 19 It would be appropriate to say that parents of deceased are generally entitled to compensation without going into question of dependency and as such income of the deceased Rishi Pal is being taken Rs. 8,000/- per month. He died on 9.3.2015 leaving behind widow aged 41 years {01/01/1974}, Son age below 21 years{31/08/1994} daughter age below 21 years {31/8/1994} and mother aged above 75 years {1/1/1940} and, therefore, they all are taken under his dependency. If four or five persons are dependent upon income of deceased, then 1/4th amount is deducted on account his living and personal expenses. Therefore, by considering the age of deceased between 42 to 45 years, multiplier of 14 is to be applied i n view of Smt. Sarla Verma and Ors. Vs SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 16 Delhi Transport Corporation and another AIR 2009 Supreme Court 3104. By applying multiplier of 14, the exact assessment of compensation would come to {72000x14} Rs. 100,8,000/- . Additionally, petitioners being parents, children and widow have deprived from love and affection and also suffered pain, agony due to untimely death, therefore, they are entitled to Rs.50,000/- in these head. They have also spent amount on last rites/funeral of deceased and so they are entitled to funeral expenses amounting Rs.30,000/-. The petitioner no.1 being widow is also entitled to Rs.50000/- as consortium and in this manner, total compensation is computed to Rs.11,38,000/-- which shall be payable along with interest @ 7.5/- per annum from the date of filing the petition till its realization to the petitioners. Rests of relief sought by petitioners-claimants stands declined. Accordingly, issue no.2 is decided in favour of claimants-petitioners. ISSUE NO.3 to 7 : 20The onus to prove these issues are upon Respondents but they neither pressed these issue nor led any evidence. However, it has already discussed in detail under Issue No.1 & 2 that accident was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. In this way, it has become obvious on file that this tribunal has left with no other option except to decide these issues against Respondents. Accordingly, both these issues are decided against Respondents. ISSUE NO.8 : 21 The onus to prove this issue is upon the respondent No.3, who is under the obligation to prove this fact that the respondent No.1 SUNITA ETC VS NASIB SINGH ETC 17 was not having a valid driving licence at the time of alleged accident and as such respondent no.2 has violated the terms and conditions of the insurance policy/cover note EX.R4 and so respondent No.3 is not liable to pay any compensation to the claimants. However, there is nothing on record to show that respondent No.1 was not holding any valid license, rather same is proved as EX.R1. Further, Insurance Policy Ex.R4 reveals that offending vehicle as per RC EX.R2, was insured with the respondent No.3 at the relevant time.
