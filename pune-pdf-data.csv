H. M. Whawal Advocate for Opponent Nos. 1 & 2 : Shri V. M. Khandalkar Advocate for Opponent No. 3 : Shri S.D. Kale J U D G M E N T (Delivered on this 28 th day of September 2020) 1­By way of this petition under section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act, applicants have claimed compensation in respect of death of Kaluram Pandurang Rokade in motor vehicular accident caused on 14.07.2014. 2­ In the present matter initially claim was filed for the compensation for the injuries sustained by Kaluram Pandurang Rokade. During the pendency of claim petition unfortunately Shri. Kaluram died and claim is amended. 3­Case of the applicant in short, is as under : The accident which gave rise to this claim took place CNR No. 3 M.A.C.P. No. 191/2015 MHPU01­005375­2015 Judgment on 14.07.2014 at about 10.30 a.m. in front of grocery shop of Shri Dnyaneshwar Pandurang Rokade at post village Pargaon Memane, Taluka Purandar, District Pune. At the time of incident, applicant was gathering/collecting dry branches of Babhul tree's which were cut by Ramesh Raosaheb Gaikwad. At that time one small tempo (Chota Hatti) bearing registration No. MH­12­JF­0363 came in a very high and excessive speed from Mavadi Pimpri road. It was going towards Saswad. The tempo driver was driving tempo rashly and negligently. He was drunken. Due to excessive speed and liquor consumption he lost control over his vehicle and dashed to applicant. Thus accident took place due to sole mistake of tempo driver. 4­ After the accident police of Je juri Police station inquired into the matter and registered offence against driver of the tempo bearing No.MH­12­JF­0363, Eknath Vishnu Devkar under various sections of Indian Penal Code and Motor Vehicles Act holding him responsible for causing accident. 5­It is further submitted that, at the time of accident deceased was 55 years old. He was farmer and earning Rs.10,000/­ per month. All the applicants were dependent upon him. Due to his sudden death, applicants suffered set back in their lives. The accident took place due to sole negligence of driver (opponent No.1) who was employee of Tempo owner (Opponent No. 2) of offending vehicle. CNR No. 4 M.A.C.P. No. 191/2015 MHPU01­005375­2015 Judgment Opponent No. 3 is registered owner. It is, therefore, prayed that, claim petition be allowed against all opponents in terms of prayer clause. 6­ Opponent No. 1 though appeared did not file his say. Hence matter proceeded without his say. 7­Opponent Nos. 2 and 3, owner of tempo appeared in the matter and filed their written statement. All the averments in petition are denied in toto. The particulars like age of applicant, his occupation, income and manner of accident are denied. It is specifically submitted that, there is mistake of opponent No. 1, driver of tempo. So, they are not at all responsible for paying any compensation. With these contentions opponent Nos.2 and 3, prayed for dismissal of the claim against them . 8­Considering rival pleadings, following issues were framed by my learned pred ecessor below Exh. 34. I have reproduced the same along with my findings thereon for the reasons given below. Sr. No. Issues Findings 1Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the driver of Small tempo of TATA Ace Company bearing No. MH­12­ JF­0363 ?In the affirmative. 2Whether the claimant sustained permanent disability due to the injuries suffered by him in the said accident, if yes, to what extent ?Injured dead during pendency CNR No. 5 M.A.C.P. No. 191/2015 MHPU01­005375­2015 Judgment 3Whether the claimant is entitled to get compensation, if yes, to what extent and from whom ?Yes Rs.10,70,947/­ from opponents No. 1 to 3 4What order ? As per final order. REASONS Admitted Facts : 9­ The involvement of tempo bearing No. MH­12­JF­ 0363 in accident is admitted. Evidence and documents : 10­The applicants examined brother of injured Dnyaneshwar Pandurang Rokade AW1 (Exh.35) and wife Smt.Mangal Kaluram Rokade AW 3 (Exh. 46) in support of contentions in the claim petition. Apart from that, applicants also relied on various documents viz. F.I.R. (Exh. 44) Medical bills (Exh. 45 collectively). Applicants also examined Shri. Ramesh Raosaheb Gaikwad AW 2, (Exh.41), Dr. Vishal Baliram Rokade AW 4 (Exh. 48), Dr. Vinayak Mahalsakant Khade AW 5 (Exh. 52). The opponents examined Somnath Vishnu Devkar (Opponent No. 2) vide Exh. 69, Shri Yashwant Namdev Satre (Exh. 89) who has produced and proved Bill (Exh. 90) and Shri. Shamrao Prakash Waghaj (Exh. 97). He has produced original Tax Invoices of India Shopee ( Exh.98 to 101). Opponents also examined Shri.Vijaykant Jagannath Bhutkar DW 3 (Exh. 102) for opponents 2 and 3 for. Bills CNR No. 6 M.A.C.P. No. 191/2015 MHPU01­005375­2015 Judgment referred by defence (Exh. 103) amounting to Rs. 12950/­ and after concession (Exh. 104) of Rs.10,000/­. As to Issue Nos. 1 to 3 11­ All the points are discussed simultaneously for the sake of convenience. Admittedly, initially claim was filed for injuries sustained by the victim. However, unfortunately the injured died during the pendency of this claim. The issues involved are thus dealt with accordingly looking to change in circumstances and scenario. 12­ Before touching the merits, it is necessary to deal with objections raised by the opponents. The opponents raised two fold objection as follows : (a)The claim is not filed by authorised person. (b)There is no nexus between accident and death. Objection (a) 13­As far as objection regarding filing of claim is concerned, initially the claim was filed by brother of deceased. Thereafter, by way of amendment all the legal heirs of the deceased i.e. wife and kids are implemented as party/applicants. In any case a claim for compensation can be filed under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 by injured himself, any legal representative of the deceased and/or by any agent duly authorised. 14­In the case at hand the claim was initially filed by the brother of deceased as legal representative and thereafter CNR No. 7 M.A.C.P. No. 191/2015 MHPU01­005375­2015 Judgment all the legal heirs are implemented as applicants by way of amendment. The said order of amendment is neither objected nor challenged by the opponents till today. As such, mere objection at the fag end do not survive. Objection (b): 15­As regards objection pertaining to nexus between accident and death is concerned, quick reference of evidence of wife of deceased would be essential. The wife of deceased Smt. Mangal Kaluram Rokade deposed as AW 3 at Exh. 46. She specifically deposed that, soon after accident her husband became unconscious. He was taken to Dhanvantari Hospital for preliminary treatment and thereafter shifted to Bharti Hospital. After discharged in the month of September 2014, follow­up treatment was going on till December­2014. In October 2017 he was again admitted in Bharti Hospital for surgery. Since the date of accident her husband was bedridden. He was unable to get up, have food or even to talk. He was not understanding any communication (verbal/ gesture). Till the last surgery, he was supplied liquid food through tube. As they were unable to afford nursing charges, she personally look after her husband. The entire evidence is thus crystal clear to show unfortunate saga took place since the date of accident till the death of the injured. Apart from merely raising objection, opponents have not brought any evidence even to remotely show that, death do not occur due to accidental injuries. CNR No. 8 M.A.C.P. No. 191/2015 MHPU01­005375­2015 Judgment 16­As a general principle of law, he who asserts shall prove the same. The applicants have specifically brought on record all the unfortunate events resulting into the death of the injured. Per contra, the opponents merely raised technical objection. It is necessary to keep in mind that, since the accident the injured never get up from bed. He was continuously kept on liquid diet. The most unfortunate part is incapability of the family to afford proper medical and nursing services due to economical condition. It would have been very unbearable for all the family members to see their most loving person in the house in such a traumatic condition. 17­The accident took place in the year 2014. Since then the injured was bedridden due to brain injury. He was continuously taking treatment till his death. Even in the year 2017 he underwent surgery regarding brain. Lastly, on 16.04.2018 he died. As already stated the opponents only raised objection. Neither any alternate theory regarding death or probability of cause of death is raised. The evidence of wife of injured clearly shows that the death is result of brain injury caused due to the accident only. 18­ Though the claim was initially filed for compensation against injuries caused, in view of amendment application (Exh. 59) the claim was amended soon after the death of the injured. As such the claim is required to be treated for compensation due to death only. This must be the reason the CNR No. 9 M.A.C.P. No. 191/2015 MHPU01­005375­2015 Judgment written arguments are also regarding cause of death and nexus between accident and demise of injured. 19­Opponent No. 2, Shri. Somnath Vishnu Devkar examined himself as DW 1 (Exh. 69). It has come in his evidence that, he has purchased the offending tempo from opponent No. 3. He has admitted that on the day of accident his brother Eknath Vishnu Devkar (Opponent No.1) was driving the tempo involved in the accident. He also admitted that his brother was having habit of drinking liquor. It is further admitted that, as accident occurred due negligence of his brother, he tried to compromise the matter. As such, it is not at all necessary to further discuss point of negligence. 20­As far as income is concerned, in the claim petition itself it is mentioned that, the deceased was earning Rs.10,000/­ per month. He was 55 years old man. He was maintaining his family satisfactorily till his last breath. As such if at all there is no any concrete evidence regarding income, still if the notional income is considered as Rs. 9,000/­ per month, it will suffice the purpose. 21­Now what remains is to decide 'just compensation'. It has already come on record that, accident took place due to negligence of tempo driver. The death has occurred during prolonged treatment being taken due to accidental injuries. 22­As far as expenses of prolonged treatment are considered applicants have furnished original medical bills of CNR No. 10 M.A.C.P. No. 191/2015 MHPU01­005375­2015 Judgment Rs.3,48,939/­ as per written submission placed on record along with Exh. 107. It is not the defence that, those are false or fabricated bills. Nonetheless our Parent High Court in Dr. Dattaraya Laxman Shinde V/s Nana Raghunath Hire and others, 2013, ACJ 474 specifically held that, Tribunal is not bound by strict rule of evidence. When original bills are produced on record and no specific case is made out by the defence that those are fabricated one, tribunal shall consider those bills. As such, though no any witness is separately examined by the applicant, to prove the bills, as the original bills are filed on record, applicants are entitled for entire amount of expenses of Rs.3,48,939/­ as compensation under this head. 23­Opponents have examined Yashwant Namdev Satre as DW 1 vide Exh. 89. He was Assistant Billing Manager at Bharti Hospital. The deceased was indoor patient in Bharti Hospital from 14.07.2014 to 15.09.2014. The total bill of hospitalization was Rs.1,09,597/­. After concession of Rs. 57,788/­, applicants have paid Rs.51,809/­ towards final bill. The said bill is at Exh. 90. Similarly, deceased was again admitted on 10.12.2014 till 20.12.2014 as indoor patient in Bharti Hospital. The total bill amount is Rs. 6,730/­. 24­ However, the applicants while submitting list of bills along with Exh.107 have fairly deleted some of the entries for want of receipt. If the evidence lead by the opponents is considered, the amount will be more than the amount mentioned in the list along with Exh.107. When CNR No. 11 M.A.C.P. No. 191/2015 MHPU01­005375­2015 Judgment these discrepancies were pointed out to the Advocate for applicants and asked whether they want to enhance their amount, she clearly stated that, she had the bills as mentioned in the list and do not want to claim any extra amount. The fair submissions are accepted. 25­ As far as evidence of DW2 Shamrao Prakash Waghaj at Exh. 97 is considered, he is distributor and sub dealer of Ayurvedic Products. He has produced and proved four tax invoices of Rs. 14,610/­ each vide Exh. 98 to 101. It comes to Rs. 58,440/­. This amount is already mentioned in the list provided by the applicant and therefore no further discussion is required. 26­As this claim is now considered as a death claim, for compensation under other heads, the notional income for the purpose of computation of compensation is held as Rs. 9,000/­. The evidence on record shows that, deceased was 61 years at the time of death. His date of birth in school Leaving Certificate is 09.09.1956. He was married and having four dependents. As such 1/4th amount is required to be deducted towards personal expenses. So also looking to his income and age, 15% amount is required to be added towards future prospects in view of National Insurance Company Limited V/s Pranay Sethi and others A.I.R. 2017 SC 5157. So also looking to age, multiplier of 7 would be applicable, in view of Sarla Verma and others V/s Delhi Transport Corporation and another 2009 ACJ 1298 . The final calculation therefore would be as follows. CNR No. 12 M.A.C.P. No. 191/2015 MHPU01­005375­2015 Judgment Sr. No. Head Compensation awarded iIncome Rs. 9,000/­ iiFuture Prospects Rs.1,350/­ (i.e.15% of the income) iiiDeduction towards personal expenditure Rs.2,588/­ (1/4th amount of Rs.9,000/­ + Rs.1,350/­) ivTotal Income : Rs.7,762/­ (i.e. Rs.9,000 + 1,350 – 2,588) vMultiplier 7 viLoss of future income Rs 6,52,008/­ (Rs.7,762 x12x7) viiLoss of consortium Rs.40,000/­ viiiFuneral expenses Rs.15,000/­ ixLoss of estate Rs.15,000/­ xHospitalization and Medical expenses Rs.3,48,939/­ Total compensation awarded : Rs.10,70,947/­ along with interest as applicable. Interest: 27­The total compensation will be thus Rs.10,70,947/­ (inclusive of interim compensation awarded under section 140 of Motor Vehicle Act.) As far as rate of interest is concern, looking to the prevailing rate of interest of banks, applicants would be entitled for interest @ 9% per annum from the date of petition till actual realization of award of compensation. 28­ Admittedly, accident took place due to sole negligence of driver of opponent No.1. Opponent Nos. 2 is owner and opponent No. 3 is the registered owner of offending vehicle. Thus all the opponents are jointly and CNR No. 13 M.A.C.P. No. 191/2015 MHPU01­005375­2015 Judgment severally liable to pay compensation to applicants. Hence I answer Issue Nos. 1 to 3 accordingly. 29­In sequel I pass following order. O R D E R 1­Claim Petition is allowed with costs. 2­The Opponent Nos. 1 to 3 shall jointly and severally pay compensation of Rs.10,70,947/­(Rs. Ten Lakhs Seventy Thousand Nine Hundred Forty Seven only ) including interim compensation awarded u/s 140 of Motor Vehicles Act along with costs and interest @ 9 % per annum from the date of petition till realization of entire amount to the applicants. 3­Out of total amount of Rs.10,70,947/­ of compensation the share of applicants would be as follows : (a)­i 50% to applicant No. 1A (i.e. Rs.5,35,474/­) (a)­ii20% each to applicant Nos. 2B and 3C (i.e. Rs. 2,14,189/­ each ) (a)­iii10% to the applicant No. 4D( i.e. Rs.1,07,095/­ ) (b)Out of amount of Rs.5,35,474/­ share of applicant No. 1, Rs. 2,00,000/­ be kept in fixed deposit for a period of five years in any Nationalised bank of the choice of applicant and rest of the amount be paid to her by account payee cheque, on due verification.

Claim Rs. 25,00,000/­ J U D G M E N T (Delivered on this 12 th Day of October 2020 ) 1­By way of this petition under section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act, applicants have claimed compensation in respect of death of Shri. Prashant Balasaheb Zende in motor vehicular accident caused on 13.08.2015. 2­Case of the applicant in short, is as under : The accident which gave rise to this claim took place on 13.08.2015 at about 3.15 a.m. in front of Gate No. 5, Off Market Yard, on Shivneri Road. At that time deceased was riding his motor­cycle bearing No.MH­12­NA­4142 and proceeding in East­West direction. He was riding motor­cycle in a moderate speed and from left side of the road by observing Rules and Regulations of Traffic. When he reached near the spot of occurrence, the offending Tempo bearing CNR No. 3 M.A.C.P. No. 689/2015 MHPU01­013954­2015 Judgment No. MH­17­AG­3324 came from opposite direction and dashed to his motor­cycle. It was head on collusion. The said Tempo was being driven by its driver very speedily as well as rashly and negligently. The driver of Tempo abruptly took right turn and gave dash to the motor­cycle of the deceased. Due to it, the deceased sustained multiple injuries and scummed to them. 3­Police of Market Yard Police station carried out investigation and registered an offence against driver of the Tempo under the various sections of Indian Penal Code as well as Motor Vehicles Act. 4­It is further contended that the deceased was an agriculturist and serving as Divanji/Accountant at M/s Sandeep Namdev Gaikwad. His salary was Rs. 12,000/­ per month. He was also earning Rs.2,00,000/­ per annum from Agricultural land. Thus, his approximate monthly income was Rs. 28,667/­. Due to untimely death of deceased, applicants have suffered great mental and financial loss. Therefore, they have claimed compensation along with interest from both the opponents. 5­Opponent No. 1, though duly served vide Exh. 16, remained absent. Hence, application proceeded exparte against him. 6­ The Opponent No. 2, Insurance Company has filed CNR No. 4 M.A.C.P. No. 689/2015 MHPU01­013954­2015 Judgment its written statement below Exh. 15. All the averments regarding age of deceased, his income, occupation, dependency and negligence are specifically denied. According to Opponent No. 2 accident took place due to the negligence of deceased himself and therefore they are not liable to pay compensation. It is, therefore, lastly prayed that, claim petition be dismissed with costs. 7­Considering rival pleadings, following issues were framed by my learned pred ecessor below Exh. 174. I have reproduced the same along with my findings thereon for the reasons given below. Sr. No. Issues Findings 1Do the applicants prove that deceased Prashant Balasaheb Zende died in the Motor vehicular accident, caused on 13.08.2015 at about 3.15 a.m. on Shivneri road, in front of Gate No. 5, off Market Yard, Pune by rash and negligent driving of Tempo bearing registration No. MH­17­AG­3334 ?In the affirmative. 2Whether applicants are entitled to compensation ? If yes, (a) from whom and (b) to what amount ?Yes from opponent Nos. 1 and 2 jointly and severally Rs. 23,53,000/­ 3What order and Award ? As per final order. CNR No. 5 M.A.C.P. No. 689/2015 MHPU01­013954­2015 Judgment R E A S O N S Admitted facts 8­ The involvement of Tempo bearing registration No. MH­17­AG­3334 is admitted. The deceased sustained multiple injuries in accident and scummed to it. An offence was registered only against Tempo driver. As to Issue No.1:­ 9­In support of contentions, applicant No. 1 examined herself at Exh. 16. Along with oral testimony, applicants also relied upon documentary evidence like F.I.R. Exh. 18, Spot panchanama Exh. 19, Inquest Panchanama Exh. 20, Medical Certificate of cause of death Exh. 21, Photo Copy of Insurance Policy Exh. 22, Form AA Exh. 23, Bill of Rao Nursing Home of Rs. 15,000/­ Exh. 24, 7/12 Extract of land standing in the name of deceased at Exh. 25. The relevant documentary evidence would be appreciated as and where required during the course of discussion. 10­Applicant No.1, wife of deceased (AW­1) specifically deposed as to how accident took place. Admittedly she is not an eye witness. Her evidence is based on the contents of police paper. It has come on record that, at the time of accident the offending Tempo being driven by the driver/ opponent No.1, dashed to the motor­cycle of deceased. Nonetheless after accident the tempo driver flee away from CNR No. 6 M.A.C.P. No. 689/2015 MHPU01­013954­2015 Judgment the spot of accident instead of helping the victim. 11­The F.I.R. and Spot panchanama also clearly show that the tempo driver drove vehicle in his possession rashly and negligently which caused accident. This must be the reason as to why factum of negligence on the part of tempo driver is not seriously challenged. Only one suggestion is given that, accident did not take place due to mistake of tempo driver. However, nothing substantial is brought on record to prove this defence. Thus oral as well as documentary evidence clearly show that, due to rash and negligent act of tempo driver accident has taken place. 12­Moving further, the Inquest panchanama (Exh.20) and Medical certificate of cause of death (Exh. 21) show cause of death “ Death due to Multiple Injuries”. Those were caused due to accident only. The evidence on the record also clearly establish that due to rash and negligent act of the driver of Tempo, accident took place. As a result of it, Prashant Balasaheb Zende died during treatment. I, therefore, hold that applicants prove that deceased Prashant Balasaheb Zende died in the Motor vehicular accident, caused on 13.08.2015 at about 3.15 a.m. on Shivneri road, in front of Gate No. 5, off Market Yard, Pune by rash and negligent driving of Tempo bearing registration No. MH­17­AG­3334 . Hence, I answer Issue No.1 in the affirmative. CNR No. 7 M.A.C.P. No. 689/2015 MHPU01­013954­2015 Judgment As to Issue No. 2 :­ 13­As far as quantum, is concern applicants have examined in all 4 witnesses to prove income of deceased. It is the case of applicants that, deceased was earning more than Rs. 500/­ per day. He was working in one shop as a salaried employee and also doing certain business. As far as business as hawker is concerned, nothing is proved apart from filing extract of two Pigmi Accounts. However, the salary of Rs. 12,000/­ per month is specifically proved by examining employee Shri. Sandeep Namdeo Gaikwad. The salary certificate (Exh. 33) is also duly proved. Apart from it the medical expenses of Rs. 15,000/­ are also duly proved by filing original medical bills. 14­As this is a death claim, for compensation under other heads, net salary for the purpose of computation of compensation would be Rs. 12,000/­. The evidence on record shows that, deceased was 38 years old. He was married and having four dependents. As such 1/4th amount is required to be deducted towards personal expenses. So also looking to his fixed salary 40% amount is required to be added towards future prospects in view of National Insurance Company Limited V/s Pranay Sethi and others A.I.R. 2017 SC 5157 .

Gupte Learned Advocate for Opponent No.1 Shri. R.S. Neurgaonkar Learned Advocate for Opponent No.2 J U D G M E N T (Delivered on 14th October, 2020) Present application is filed under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act for compensation in respect of death of Mr. Pralhad Shravan Kamble in vehicular accident. Facts of case in brief are as follows : 2. On 01.01.2015, at 7.30 p.m. Shri. Pralhad Shravan Kamble was crossing the road by walk in front of Union Bank, Lulla Nagar Chowk, Pune. He was observing traffic rules and regulations while crossing the road. At that time one Wagon R car No.MH­12­HF­3825 owned by respondent No.1 came from Golibar Chowk in extreme high CNR : MHPU01­004886­2015 3 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.170/2015 Nirmala Nikalje & Ors Vs.Nandini Naik & Ors. speed and without following traffic rules. Said car gave severe dash to Pralhad Kamble and because of which he sustained grievious injury on head. He was immediately admitted at Sassoon Hospital, Pune, but he died during treatment on 03.01.2015. Applicants have spend amount of Rs.20,000/­ for treatment of Pralhad Kamble. The incident of accident is registered with Kondhwa Police Station under Section 279, 304(A) of I.P.C. and Section 119/177 of the Motor Vehicles Act. Prior to death deceased was working as a Mason and his monthly income was Rs.7000/­. The applicants were dependent on income of deceased since applicant No.1 was residing with him from long time due to family dispute. Therefore, applicants are claiming compensation of Rs.5,00,000/­ with interest at the rate of 18% per annum. 3.Application is seriously opposed by respondent No.1 on the basis of her written statement below Exh.45. It is submitted that the application is false, frivolous and filed with an intent to harass respondent No.1. Applicants have suppressed material facts and there is no cause of action for filing of application. It is denied that the driver of Wagon R car No.MH­12­HF­3825 was driving his vehicle in high speed and without following traffic rules. On the contrary, the deceased himself was crossing the road hastily without following traffic rules and accident has occurred due his to mistake and negligence. It is denied that an amount of CNR : MHPU01­004886­2015 4 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.170/2015 Nirmala Nikalje & Ors Vs.Nandini Naik & Ors. Rs.20,000/­ is spent by applicant for treatment of deceased. It is denied that deceased was doing Mason work and his monthly income was Rs.7000/­. It is denied that deceased was only earning member and applicants were dependent upon his income. On the contrary, both applicants are married, so it cannot be said that they were depending on income of deceased. Further it is submitted that vehicle involved in the accused was insured with opponent No. 2 and the insurance policy was existing at the time of accident. Therefore, opponent No.2 is responsible to pay compensation. Accordingly, prayer is made to reject application or alternatively request is made to direct opponent No.2 to pay compensation. 4. Matter is also contested by opponent No.2 on the basis of W.S. below Exh. 17. It is submitted that the claim of compensation of Rs.5,00,000/­ is not true, legal and bona fide. The applicants are not dependents of deceased and hence, they are not entitled to claim compensation. It is admitted that Wagon R car No.MH­12­HF­3825 was insured with opponent No.2 insurance company during validity period 04.08.2014 to 03.08.2015. It is disputed that the deceased was self employed and earning Rs.7000/­ per month. It is denied that the car driver was driving car in high and excessive speed and gave severe dash to deceased. On the other hand, the deceased was crossing the road in confused CNR : MHPU01­004886­2015 5 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.170/2015 Nirmala Nikalje & Ors Vs.Nandini Naik & Ors. state of mind. He was not attentive to traffic while crossing the road. Moreover, car driver slowed down his vehicle, blow horn and applied brakes to avoid accident. So, the deceased himself is contributory to the accident. Further, it is submitted that the offending vehicle was driven by Shri. A. S. Naik and he had no valid and effective driving license on the day of accident i.e. on 01.01.2015 as he had not renewed his driving license. The insurance policy by specified condition excluded legal liability in respect of third­party risk arising whilst the vehicle was driven by a person who did not held effective driving license. Therefore, opponent No.1 committed breach of condition of insurance policy and hence, insurance company is not liable to pay any compensation. In pursuance to all such averments opponent No.2 prayed to reject claim petition. 5. Considering pleadings of parties following issues were framed by my learned predecessor below Exh.19 and I have recorded my findings thereon for the reasons stated hereinafter. : SR. NO. ISSUES FINDINGS 1] Whether due to rash and negligent driving of the Wagon R bearing No. MH­12­HF­3825 an accident occurred and as a consequence thereof Shri. Pralhad Shravan Kamble died? Yes CNR : MHPU01­004886­2015 6 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.170/2015 Nirmala Nikalje & Ors Vs.Nandini Naik & Ors. 2] Whether the claimants are entitled to get compensation? If yes, what should be the quantum?Yes. To extent of Rs.3,50,020/­ 3] Who is liable to pay compensation ? Opponent No. 1 & 2 4] What order and award ? As per final order. R E A S O N S ISSUE NO.1 : 6. With an intent to substantiate the contents of application applicant No.1 Nirmala Nikalje deposed vide her affidavit Exh.22. It has come in her evidence that deceased Pralhad Kamble was her father. On 01.01.2015 at 7.30 p.m. at Lulla Nagar Chowk, he was crossing road by walk. At that time, Wagon R car No.MH­12­HF­3825 came in excessive speed and without observing traffic rules and regulations and gave severe dash to him. In that accident Pralhad sustained serious head injury, he was admitted at Sassoon Hospital Pune but died on 03.01.2015. It is her specific contention that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of car driver and he is solely responsible for premature death of Pralhad Kamble. 7. It is the case of opponent No. 2 in their written statement that Pralhad Kamble was contributory negligent in CNR : MHPU01­004886­2015 7 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.170/2015 Nirmala Nikalje & Ors Vs.Nandini Naik & Ors. accident as he was crossing the road in confused state of mind and without being attentive to circumstances of the road. In fact it is contention of opponent No.2 that car driver slowed down his vehicle, blow horn ad applied brakes to avoid accident. It is not understandable as to how opponent No.2 learnt about the scene and circumstances appearing at accident spot. Since none on behalf of opponent No.2 was present at the time of actual accident, it is quite difficult to understand, how they depict the scene of accident. In this context certain questions were asked to applicant No.1 in cross­examination. She unequivocally denied that accident had taken place due to mistake of her father and that the driver of offending car was not at fault. Thus, the contents in written statement of opponent No.2 in respect of point of contributory negligence are fully unsubstantiated and unbelievable. 8.On careful perusal of written statement of both opponents it is manifest that they are admitting the incident of accident as described by applicants and a fact that Pralhad Kamble succumbed to that accident. The oral evidence of applicant No.1 has sufficed to establish this fact on record. Apart from that in order to prove accident the applicants are placing reliance upon certain important documentary evidence. CNR : MHPU01­004886­2015 8 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.170/2015 Nirmala Nikalje & Ors Vs.Nandini Naik & Ors. It is significant to note that the incident of accident is register with Kondhwa Police Station vide C.R. No. 5/2015 under Section 279, 304(A) of I.P.C. and Section 119/177 of M.V. Act. The certified copy of F.I.R. is at Exh.26, the statement of first informant Nanasaheb Bharud is at Exh. 25. Inquest Panchanama of Pralhand Kamble is at Exh. 27. The medical notification of death is at Exh.28, The intimation of motor accident as per Section 254 and 255 of M.V. Act is at Exh. 29. It is explicit from medical notification of death Exh.28 that Pralhad Kamble died due to head injury resulting out of accident. The inquest panchanama further shows the various injuries on the body of deceased. Most importantly first informant Nana Bharud stated in clear terms that the driver of Wagon R car No.MH­12­HF­3825 drove his vehicle in extreme high speed after start of signal near Union Bank at Lulla Nagar Chowk. It is also mentioned that said car gave very severe dash to Pralhad Kamble. The intimation of motor accident at Exh.29 further consolidates the accident. It is clear from all these documents that the incident of accident has really occurred as alleged by applicant. There is nothing in the cross­examination of applicant No.1 to disbelieve her version. On the contrary, though opponents admitted accident, they are unable to prove that it occurred due to mistake of deceased or deceased is contributory negligent in accident. CNR : MHPU01­004886­2015 9 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.170/2015 Nirmala Nikalje & Ors Vs.Nandini Naik & Ors. 9.Taking into consideration over all aspects of the matter and in the light of discussion in forgoing paragraphs, there may not be hesitation to hold that, on 01.01.2015 at 7.30 p.m. Pralhad Kamble was crossing the road by walk and at that time the driver of Wagon R car No.MH­12­HF­3825 drove his vehicle in high speed and in rash and negligent manner thereby committed an accident and as a consequence of that accident Pralhad Kamble died. Therefore, point No.1 is answered in affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO. 2 AND 3 : 10.In instant matter the petition is opposed by opponents not only on factual grounds but also on legal grounds. It is objected on behalf of opponent No.2 that applicants have no locus­standi to file this petition and claim compensation. Similarly, it is objected that at the time of accident the driver of offending car was not holding valid and effective driving license and as such respondent No.2 company is not responsible to pay compensation since there is breach of conditions of policy agreement. 11.Opponent No.2 has firstly questioned the locus­ standi of applicant No.1 and 2, since they are married daughters and not dependent upon the income of deceased. However, it has unequivocally come in pleading as well as evidence of applicant that they were dependent upon CNR : MHPU01­004886­2015 10 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.170/2015 Nirmala Nikalje & Ors Vs.Nandini Naik & Ors. deceased. During cross­examination applicant No.1 disclosed that her husband died in year 2008. She is working as a maid servant and earning Rs.3000/­ per month. It is clear from these aspects of the matter that applicants had no sufficient source of living and they were indeed dependent upon the income of deceased. 12.In the context of locus­standi of applicants the learned counsel of opponent No.2 relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Allahabad High Court Chandravati Vs. Ramsevak 2014 ACJ 1669 . In this judgment it is observed by Hon'ble High Court that ­ married daughter cannot be termed as dependent on her father unless shown to be deserted by her husband or she is a widow or divorcee. Claimant is entitled to compensation only to extent of no fault liability compensation as per Section 140 of M.V. Act. 13.It is clear from the ratio of judgment that the married daughter is not a dependent unless she is deserted by her husband or a widow or a divorcee. In case in hand applicant No.1 is a divorcee, therefore, she cannot be kept out of the purview of term “dependent”. Apart from that it has come in evidence of applicant No.1 that due to family dispute she was staying with her deceased father from a very long time. Moreover it has come in cross­examination of applicant that she is a widow. In the light of such aspects of the matter, CNR : MHPU01­004886­2015 11 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.170/2015 Nirmala Nikalje & Ors Vs.Nandini Naik & Ors. applicants cannot be deprived from compensation holding them as not dependent upon deceased Pralhad Kamble. 14.Furthermore, Hon'ble Supreme Court in the judgment of Manjuri Bera Vs. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. 2007 ACJ 1279 observed that ­ married daughter not dependent on deceased is entitled to file claim for the death of her father. In this judgment the concept of legal representative is discussed as – it stipulates a person who may or may not be legal heir competent to inherit the property of the deceased but can represent the estate of the deceased person. It includes heirs as well as persons who represent the estate even without title. 15.It is abundantly clear from the ratio of above judgments that applicants have right to file a petition for compensation of death of their father in motor accident. Hence, I am not in agreement with the advancement of learned counsel of opponent No.2 that applicants have not right to file this application as they are not dependent on the income of deceased. 16.Further legal objection of opponent is about breach of policy conditions. It is submitted in written statement Exh.17 that on the day of accident i.e. on 01.01.2015 offending driver A. S. Naik had no valid and CNR : MHPU01­004886­2015 12 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.170/2015 Nirmala Nikalje & Ors Vs.Nandini Naik & Ors. effective driving license to drive a car. The card driver failed to renew his driving license as per provisions of M.V. Act prior to date of accident. There is a specified condition in policy in respect of third party risk arising whilst the vehicle was driven by a person who had no effective driving license. Hence, there is clear cut breach of conditions of insurance policy and by virtue of Section 149 of M.V. Act opponent No.2 cannot be held responsible to pay compensation. 17.Opponent No.2 has placed on record the extract of driving license of Atul Somnath Naik below Exh.59. The validity period of license is between 03.02.2015 to 02.02.2020. Indisputably accident has occurred on 01.01.2015 as such it is crystal clear that on the day of accident the offending driver had no valid and effective license . 18.In order to buttress this point of breach of policy condition the learned counsel of opponent No.2 is relying upon the judgment of Hon'ble Rajashtan High Court in case of Girdhar Kanwar Vs. New India Assurance Company Ltd. 2014 ACJ 448 . In this judgment it is observed by Hon'ble High Court that ­ owner despite service of notice failed to produce driving license of his driver, therefore, a presumption can be drawn against the owner and driver that driver was not holding a valid license . CNR : MHPU01­004886­2015 13 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.170/2015 Nirmala Nikalje & Ors Vs.Nandini Naik & Ors. 19.Reliance is placed to emphasize the point of “pay and recover”, upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court Pappu and others Vs. Vinodkumar Lamba 2018 ACJ 690 wherein Supreme Court observed – the fact that vehicle was duly insured would per se does not make the insurance company liable. Directions were given to insurance company to pay compensation amount and recover the same from owner of vehicle. 20.It is clear from the judgment of Pappu cited supra that on the point of breach of license condition insurance company is not wholly exonerated from the liability of compensation. 21.On the point of “pay and recover”, another judgment of Hon'ble Bombay High Court National Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Salouni Subhashchandra Nagzarkar 2014 ACJ 2762 is relied upon. 22.In order to counter the above proposition of the learned Counsel of opponent No.2 reliance can be placed upon the judgments of Hon'ble Supreme Court viz, Pappu and others versus Vinod Kumar Lamba (2018) 3 SCC 208 and Amrit Paul Singh versus Tata AIG General Insurance company limited (2018 ) 7 SCC 558. CNR : MHPU01­004886­2015 14 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.170/2015 Nirmala Nikalje & Ors Vs.Nandini Naik & Ors. 23.In above judgments Hon'ble Apex Court has ruled that even if breach is proved, insurance company has to pay compensation to claimants and then recover it from vehicle owner. 24.It is clear from above ratio that, the insurance company cannot escape themselves from the liability of compensation under the excuse of breach of policy condition. Therefore, even if it is assumed that there is breach of policy condition, respondent No.2 is still responsible for paying compensation. Thus, there is no material in the reply or evidence of respondent No.2 to exonerate them from paying compensation. 25.Moving one step ahead even otherwise if it is assumed that the driving license of offending driver is fake, on that ground insurance company cannot claim exemption of paying compensation. In this behalf reliance can be placed upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Swaransingh and others, 2004 ACJ 1. In this judgment Hon'ble Apex Court held that – mere absence of license, fake or invalid license or disqualification of the driver for driving are not in themselves defences available to insurance company. It is further ratio of this judgment that in case of breach of terms of policy, insurance company has to satisfy the award and then recover the awarded amount from the owner or driver of truck. CNR : MHPU01­004886­2015 15 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.170/2015 Nirmala Nikalje & Ors Vs.Nandini Naik & Ors. 26.It is clear from ratio of above judgment that, insurance company cannot escape from the liability of payment of compensation on the ground of breach of policy condition, to be more specific, under allegation that the driving license of offending vehicle is fake. Hence, even though if it is accepted that at relevant time the driving of offending vehicle had fake driving license, still insurance company is under obligation to pay compensation. Thus the grievance of respondent No.2 that the driver of offending vehicle had fake driving license, is of no consequence and opponent No.2 insurance company cannot be fully exonerated. 27.It has come in evidence of applicant No.1 that she and applicant No. 2 are daughters of deceased Pralhad Kamble. At the time of death the age of deceased was 70 years and he was a healthy person. The deceased was working as a Mason and earning Rs.7000/­ per month. Deceased was only breadwinner of applicants family and they were dependent on his income. The wife of deceased expired in year 1997 and since then he was taking are of his daughters. Applicant No.1 is residing with her deceased father from long time due to family dispute. Due to death of Pralhad Kamble applicants have lost love and affection of their father. The learned advocate of opponent No.1 and 2 have cross­examined CNR : MHPU01­004886­2015 16 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.170/2015 Nirmala Nikalje & Ors Vs.Nandini Naik & Ors. applicant No.1 to their satisfaction, but there is no material in cross­examination to disbelieve aforementioned things. 28.With an object to support the point of income of deceased Pralhad, applicants have examined his employer Vilas Alhat P.W. 2 at Exh. 35. It has come in his evidence that from 30 years he is working as a plumbing contractor and Pune Municipal Corporation has issued license to him for said work. This license is filed at article 'A'. he finally deposed that Pralhad Kamble was working with him and he was paying him remuneration Rs. 250/­ to 300/­ per day per work. He specifically states that Pralhad Kamble was good in his job. 29.The learned advocate for opponent No.2 though cross­examined this witness, there is no outcome to disbelieve his earlier version. However it is worthy to mention that he admitted that he does not have documentary evidence to show that deceased Pralhad was working with him and he used to pay him remuneration. 30.At this juncture it is necessary to mention that the grant of compensation under Motor Vehicle Act is a part of welfare legislation. Further it is settled principle of law that strict rules of evidence are not applicable to proceedings of motor accident claim petition. Finally it is observed by Hon'ble High Court that ­ the words of employer can be CNR : MHPU01­004886­2015 17 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.170/2015 Nirmala Nikalje & Ors Vs.Nandini Naik & Ors. trusted pertaining to the income of deceased in case of motor accident claim petition. 31.Apart from that in support of above said proposition, reliance can be placed upon judgment of Uma Sharmay Vs. Avtar Singh 2012 ACJ 2515 . It is observed that­ when the monthly income is not proved, then compensation can be granted on the basis of minimum wages payable at relevant time . 32.Similarly Hon'ble Supreme Court in the judgment S. Manickam Vs. M.T. Corp Ltd. 2013 (5) ALL MR 477 SC observed that ­ while determining just compensation approach has to be broad based and liberal . 33.Taking into consideration the ratio of above judgment and in the light of pleading and evidence of applicants I see no impediment to believe that deceased Pralhad was working as a Mason and his monthly salary was Rs.7000/­ per month. It is pertinent to mention that in recent times monthly income of a person to extent of Rs.7000/­ per month cannot be termed as excessive, imaginary and inappropriate. 34.Taking into consideration the oral and documentary evidence adduced by applicants and in view of CNR : MHPU01­004886­2015 18 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.170/2015 Nirmala Nikalje & Ors Vs.Nandini Naik & Ors. the entire discussion in forgoing paragraphs, it is now well established on record that at the time of death the age of deceased Pralhad was 70 years and his monthly income was Rs.7000/­. There are 2 living members in the family of deceased, so out of above income, 1/3 ought to have deducted towards personal and living expenditure. Indisputably the age of deceased is 70 years, so multiplier 5 is applicable. Calculation of compensation in tabular form : Age : 70 years Multiplier : 5 Deduction of living expenditure: 1/3 Monthly income : Rs.7000/­ Towards loss of dependency:Rs.7000/(Monthly income) ­ Rs.2333/­ (1/3 living expenditure)=4667 x 12 = Rs. 56,004 (multiplicand) = Total Rs. :Rs.56,004 x 5 = Rs.2,80,020 /­(loss of dependency) Other heads :Rs. 70,000/­ (C onsortium Rs.40,000/­ + loss of love and estate Rs.15,000/­ + Funeral expenditure Rs. 15,000/­ ) Total compensation amount:Rs. 3,50,020/­ 35.To sum up applicants are entitled for Rs. 2,80,020/­ towards loss of dependency and Rs. 70,000/­ towards consortium, towards loss of love, estate and towards CNR : MHPU01­004886­2015 19 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.170/2015 Nirmala Nikalje & Ors Vs.Nandini Naik & Ors. funeral expenses. Thus, applicant is entitled to compensation of Rs. 3,50,020/­ . 36.In the light of discussion in above paragraphs It has sufficiently come on record that the accident has taken place due to rash and negligent driving of Wagon R car No.MH­12­HF­3825 owned by opponent No. 1. There is no evidence in the proceeding to believe that deceased Pralhad Kamble was also contributory negligent in the accident. Since opponent No.1 is owner of offending vehicle and opponent No. 2 is its insurer they are jointly and severally responsible for payment of compensation.

CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 3 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. Facts of case in brief are as follows : 2.On 28.01.2015 applicant No. 1 was unwell and she was admitted in Anand Hospital, Kunjirwadi, Taluka – Haveli, District – Pune. In the evening her husband Khajappa and one Durga Mane came to Anand Hospital for giving tiffin box. After meeting applicant No.1 and giving her tiffin box Khajappa proceeded to his house. At that time on Pune­ Solapur Highway, when they were crossing the road from Solapur side one Tanker No. MH­12­HD­53 came in extreme high speed, in rash and negligent manner and without following traffic rules. Said tanker gave dash to Khajappa from its front left side and in that accident he sustained head and other multiple grievous injuries. The accident has occurred due to mistake of tanker driver, as he did not apply brakes and he did not try to avoid accident. The injured was rushed to Marathe Hospital, Kunjirwadi, later on shifted to Shivam Hospital, Fursungi. The doctors at Shivam Hospital declared that injured was dead. 3.At the time of death age of deceased was 45 years and he was stout and healthy. He was working as Mathadi Kamgar and used to do the work of loading and unloading cement sacks in trucks. The average salary of deceased was Rs.11,000/­ per month. Applicants and opponent No.4 were dependent upon the income of deceased and due to his death they have lost their only source of living. CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 4 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. 4.At the time of accident opponent No.1 was driving the offending tanker and opponent No.2 is owner of it. The said vehicle was duly insured with opponent No.3 insurance company during period 08.10.2014 to 07.10.2015. Hence, they all are individually and jointly liable to pay compensation. In pursuance to all such averments applicants prayed for grant of compensation to extent of Rs.25,00,000/­ together with interest at the rate of 18% p.a. 5.The summons of the proceeding was duly served upon all opponents. However, opponent No.1 did not choose to appear in the matter and opponent No.2 did not opt to file his W.S. Nonetheless matter is seriously contested by opponent No.3 on the basis of written statement below Exh.23. During pendancy of the matter, opponent no.4 died on 19.09.2020. So matter is abated against her. 6.Opponent No.3 admitted that the tanker in question bearing No. MH­12­HD­53 belongs to opponent No.2 and opponent No.3 company had issued its insurance policy for validity period between 08.10.2014 to 07.10.2015. Regardless to that, it has been submitted that the claim of applicant is not true, legal and bona fide. Opponent has denied all allegations made by applicants in their application. CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 5 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. 7.It is submitted that, towards premium of insurance policy opponent No.2 had issued a cheque of Rs.34,044/­ . But said cheque was dishonoured by Standard Chartered Bank for reason of, “insufficient funds”. Immediately thereafter opponent No.3 canceled the insurance policy by sending a letter dated 13.10.2014 to opponent No. 2 by RPAD. Furthermore, opponent issued a letter dated 16.10.2014 by registered post to R.T.O., Pune stating that policy is canceled due to dishonour of premium amount cheque. Thus, it is clear that on 28.01.2015 due to cancellation, the insurance policy was not existing. Since policy was canceled the vehicle cannot be said to be insured with opponent No.3 company and, therefore, insurance company is not responsible to pay any compensation. 8.Further, opponent No.3 had denied that age of deceased was 45 years, and that he was stout and healthy and earning Rs.11,000/­ per month. On the contrary, it is submitted that the claim of applicants is unjustified and without proof. It is denied that tanker driver was driving his vehicle in high speed and in rash and negligent manner. On the other hand the deceased was crossing the road carelessly and without following traffic rules. Thus, deceased himself is responsible for accident. In the light of all such objections opponent No. 3 urged to dismiss claim petition. CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 6 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. 9.Considering pleadings of parties following issues were framed by my learned predecessor below Exh.35 and I have recorded my findings thereon for the reasons stated hereinafter. : SR. NO. ISSUES FINDINGS 1] Whether the applicants prove that on 28.01.2015 at about 10.30 p.m. at Solapur – Pune Road, Kunjirwadi Chowk, Taluka – Haveli, impugned accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of Tanker bearing registration No. MH­ 12­ HD­ 53 by it's driver ?Yes 2] Whether it is prove that, the insurance policy was cancelled for non payment of cheque and policy was not in existence on the date of accident ?Yes 3] Whether the applicants are entitled for compensation?

CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 7 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. R E A S O N S ISSUE NO. 2 : 10.In instant matter opponent No.3 insurance company does not deny the incident of accident on 28.01.2015 at 10.30 p.m. at Kunjirwadi Chowk on Pune – Solapur Highway. Further it is not denied by the insurance company that the offending tanker MH­12­HD­53 was driven by opponent No.1 and owned by opponent No.2. Most importantly opponent No.3 accepted that the vehicle in question was insured with them and they had issued insurance policy No. 1609003114P105098716 for validity period 08.10.2014 to 07.10.2015. Irrespective of that opponent No.3 has taken a legal defence that, they are not liable to pay any compensation to applicants, since the cheque No. 015184 dated 08.10.2014 of insurance premium amount Rs.34,044/­ drawn on Rajarshi Shahu Sahakari Bank Ltd., Pune branch at Manjri, was dishonoured for reason of, “insufficient funds”. Since the premium amount was unpaid, insurance policy was not enforceable and therefore, insurance company is not liable to pay compensation. 11.In order to strengthen above defence Hawasrao Lagad deposed below Exh.56 on behalf of insurance company. It is come in his evidence that United Indian Insurance CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 8 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. Company Ltd. had issued insurance policy No. 1609003114P105098716 for tanker No. MH­12­HD­53. Towards insurance premium of above policy opponent No. 2 gave cheque No. 015184 of Rs.34,044/­. However, said cheque was dishonoured and returned without encashing. Therefore, the insurance policy was immediately canceled. Further a letter was sent to opponent No.2 intimating that policy was canceled. Not only that, intimation was given on 16.10.2014 to RTO, Pune regarding cancellation of policy. As the premium of insurance policy was not paid policy was not existing and, therefore, insurance company is not responsible to pay compensation. 12. In order to consolidate above oral evidence opponent No.3 has placed on record certain relevant documentary evidence. The cheque given by opponent No.2 towards payment of premium is at Exh. 59. The memo of Standard Chartered Bank pertaining to return of unpaid cheque is at Exh. 60. The memo of dishonour of cheque is at Exh. 61. The letter dated 13.10.2014 written by insurance company to opponent No.3 regarding cancellation of insurance policy is at Exh. 62. The postal receipt of sending RPAD item to opponent No.3 and RTO Pune are respectively at Exh. 63 and 64. The letters written to post master of Post Office, S.P. College, Pune are at Exh.67 and 68. The extract of postal register maintained by insurance company is at Exh.70. CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 9 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. 13. The learned advocate for applicant thoroughly cross­examined the witness of opponent No.3. However, there is nothing in cross­examination to disbelieve the version of opponent No.3 company. The applicant's advocate is not successful to show that the pleadings of opponent No.3 regarding dishonour of insurance premium cheque are false and incorrect. On the contrary, the oral and documentary evidence adduced by opponent No.3 company has sufficiently established on record that opponent No.2 gave cheque Exh.59 towards payment of insurance amount but the cheque was returned unpaid. It is clear from this aspect that on the day of accident the premium amount of insurance policy was unpaid. 14.In order to consolidate above point of defence the learned advocate for opponent No.3 placed his reliance upon the judgment of Hon'ble Jharkhand High Court National Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Ramjee Pandey 2009 ACJ 2301, wherein it is observed that – cheque towards premium was dishonoured and insurance company canceled the policy on 04.04.1996 under the intimation of the owner. Owner paid the premium in cash and insurance company issued fresh policy with effect from 12.04.1996. Accident took place on 08.04.1996. Insurance company is not liable and no direction to pay and recover can be issued to the insurance where there is no insurance policy in force. CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 10 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. 15.Reliance is further placed upon the judgment of Hon'le Orissa High Court Divisional Manager Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Babaji Rout 2009 ACJ 2124 . It is held in this judgment that – cheque towards payment of premium was dishourned and insurance company cancelled the policy under the intimation to the owner and concern RTO much prior to the date of accident. Insurance company is not held liable to pay any compensation. 16.The learned counsel of opponent also placed reliance upon the judgment of Hon'ble Bombay High Court New Indian Assurance Company Ltd. Vs. Kashinath Raot 2012 CJ (Bom.) 195 . In this judgment Hon'ble Bombay High Court held that ­ responsibility can not be fastened upon insurance company even under scheme, “ pay and recover”. 17.It is clear from oral and documentary evidence of opponent No.3 as well as the ratio of judgments of Hon'ble High Court cited supra that unless and until the full premium amount of insurance policy was paid the insurance policy does not become operational. When insurance policy is canceled for reason of non payment of premium amount, insurance company cannot be held liable to pay compensation. 18.In order to obliterate the version of opponent No.3 as regard to cancellation of policy and its intimation to owner and RTO, the learned advocate for applicant is relying upon CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 11 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. the judgment of Hon'ble Bombay High Court in case of Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Yogendra Patil 2007 ACJ 2051. In this judgment it is held by Hon'ble Bombay High Court that ­ insurance company is not exempted from liability in the event of failure to show that the letter of policy cancellation was addressed and duly served upon insured and registering authority. 19.The learned advocate of applicant also placed his reliance upon the judgment of Hon'ble Bombay High Court Oriental Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Prakash Mirgany 2006 ACJ 15. In this judgment Hon'ble High Court held that – insurance company is liable to pay compensation where insurance company failed to give notice to registering authority where vehicle is registered under Section 105 and adopt proceeding for cancellation of contract of insurance. 20.In order to redress above point opponent No.3 adduced evidence of Ravindra Devkar (D.W.2) below Exh. 76. It has come in his evidence that he was serving as public relation officer Pune city head post office. Postal receipts Exh. 63 and 64 were referred to him. He testified that the articles under said receipts were booked from their offence addressed to opponent No.2 and R.T.O., Pune. He further states that articles are not returned unserved. The learned advocate of applicant cross­examined him, but there is no positive result of cross­examination from applicant's point of view. CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 12 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. 21.Opponent further examined postman Ram Gosavi (D.W.3) below Exh. 81. It has come in his evidence that the postal envelop under postal receipt Exh. 64 was delivered by him. Though this witness admitted that he has no documentary evidence regarding delivering of article, I see no occasion to disbelieve him. On the other hand it can safely be inferred that evidence of witness Ram Gosavi fortifies the delivery of article under postal receipt Exh.64. 22.Opponent No.3 lastly examined postman Subhash Kale (D.W.4) below Exh. 41. He testified about due delivery of article under postal receipt Exh. 63 to opponent No.2. There is nothing in the cross­examination to disbelieve his earlier version. 23.It is abundantly clear from evidence of Ravindra Devkar (D.W.2), Ram Gosavi (D.W.3) and Subhash Kale (D.W.4) that the intimation letter of cancellation of insurance policy was properly dispatched and delivered to opponent No.2 and R.T.O., Pune. 24. Besides above aspects the learned advocate for opponent No.3 rightly relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Kerla High Court Prasanna B. Vs. Kabeer P.K. and another 2019 ACJ 43. In this judgment Hon'ble Kerla High Court held that – the burden to prove intimation of cancellation of policy CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 13 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. due to dishonour of insurance premium cheque is not upon insurance company. No liability can be fastened on the insurance company for any compensation payable in respect of an accident that occurs after the service of intimation. 25.It is clear from the ratio of judgment above that even otherwise insurance company is not burdened to prove due delivery of intimation letter of policy cancellation. 26.It is emphatically clear from above discussion that opponent No.2 issued cheque No. 015184 dated 08.10.2014 of Rs.34,044/­ in favour of opponent No.3 insurance company towards payment of insurance premium. It is also established on record that said cheque was dishonoured for reason, “insufficient funds”. It is sufficiently proved by opponent No.3 on record that after dishonour of cheque the insurance policy No. 1609003114P105098716 of Tanker No. MH­12­HD­53 was cancelled and the intimation of cancellation was given by R.P.A.D. to opponent No.2 and R.T.O., Pune. Thus, there is due compliance of Section 147 (1) and 149(1) of the Motor Vehicle Act. Furthermore as per Section 64 – VB of Insurance Act the policy does not come in force unless complete premium is paid. 27.It is manifest from above peculiar aspects of the matter that due to non payment of premium amount insurance policy was cancelled by insurance company and, therefore, on the date of accident the policy was not in existence. Hence, point No2 is answered in affirmative. CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 14 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. AS TO POINT NO.1 : 28. With an object to prove the incident of accident, in affidavit below Exh. 36 applicant No.1 deposed that she was admitted at Anand Hospital, Kunjirwadi, Pune. On 28.01.2015 her husband Khajappa together with his cousin sister Durga Mane visited hospital for giving tiffin. After giving tiffin they proceeded back to their house. On the way to their house, they were crossing Pune­Solapur Highway by walk and at that time Tanker No.MH­12­HD­53 driven by opponent No.1 came in excessive high speed, rash and negligent manner and without following traffic rules from Solapur side. Said tanker due to excessive speed and unmindful condition of road gave dash to Khajappa. In that accident Khajappa sustained multiple grievous injuries including serious head injury. He was immediately firstly taken by Ganesh Suryawanshi in his Bolero Jeep No. Mh­12­CH­ 9231 to Marathe Hospital and later on to Shivam Hospital, Fursungi. The medical officer of Shivam Hospital declared that Khajappa was dead. It has specifically come in her evidence that the accident has occurred due to mistake of opponent No.1, as he did not apply brakes and did not reduce speed of vehicle. The accident has taken place due to rash and negligent act of opponent No.1. The report of accident was lodged with Loni Kalbhor Police Station for an offence CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 15 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. punishable under Section 279, 304 (A) 338 of I.P.C. and Section 184, 134/177 of Motor Vehicle Act vide C.R. No. 33/2015. 29.It is necessary to mention that this important witness is not cross examined by the advocate of opponent No.1 and opponent No.2 i.e. driver and owner of offending vehicle. However, the witness is cross­examined by the learned advocate of opponent No.3. In W.S. below Exh.23, opponent No.3 disputed that the driver of Tanker No.MH­12­ HD­53 was driving his vehicle in excessive speed, rash and negligently and without following traffic rules. On the other hand it is submitted that, the deceased was carelessly crossing the road without being attentive to traffic. The deceased all of sudden without any indication came in front of tanker, thus, he himself is responsible for accident. It is explicitly denied by opponent No.3 that the accident has occurred due to excessive speeding of tanker or its rash and negligent driving. It is a matter of fact that no one on behalf of opponent No.3 has witnessed the actual accident. Therefore, it is difficult to understand as to how opponent No.3 learnt that the accident occurred due to careless behaviour of deceased as he himself suddenly came in front of tanker. Even otherwise the story put forth by opponent No.3 is not digestible. 30.The oral evidence of Basavva (P.W.1) is duly supported and corroborated by documentary evidence. The CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 16 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. statement of first informant Ganesh Suryawanshi is at Exh. 39, spot panchanama with rough sketch of incident spot is at Exh. 40, inquest panchanama is at Exh. 41. Form No. AA is at Exh.42. Medical notification of death is at Exh. 43. School leaving certificate of deceased Khajappa is at Exh. 44 and postmortem report is at Exh. 45. It is significant to note that the genuineness of all these documents is not seriously challenged by opponent No.3. Neither it has been established that those documents are bogus and cannot be taken into consideration. 31.It is has come in the statement of Ganesh Suryawanshi that deceased Khajappa met with an accident caused by tanker No.MH­12­HD­53. He had seen the tanker standing at incident spot. He had taken the injured to Shivam Hospital where he took his last breath. It can be gathered from his statement that tanker No.MH­12­HD­53 is responsible for causing accident and grieviously injuring Khajappa. 32.Spot panchanama Exh. 40 has further established on record the actual situation appearing at scene of offence. It is mentioned in panchanama that the offending tanker was standing facing towards west. The total width of road is 30 feet. Brake marks of 17 feet are seen at incident spot. The panchanam is attached with rough sketch of incident spot. It is manifest from recitals of panchanama that the width of road is very big as much CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 17 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. as 30 feet. Considering such width of the road no one will disagree with the fact that a vehicle in moderate speed shall be in comfortable position to avoid an accident or any untoward incident. Despite big width of the road, the driver was not in condition to avoid accident, this itself speaks in volume that he was not in complete control of his vehicle. On the contrary, there are brake marks of 17 feet. It is clear from the length of brake marks that the tanker driver was driving his vehicle in extremely high speed and he could not avert accident despite seeing the deceased on road from a fair distance. Further it is never case of any opponent that there was traffic on the road making accident inevitable. All these aspects clearly point out the guilt of tanker driver according to doctrine of Res ipsa loquitor. Apart from that it can be gathered from postmortem report Exh. 45 that the impact of injury on the head of deceased was so serious that it became the sole cause of his death. All these factors comprehensively demonstrate that the accident has taken place due to rashness and negligent of opponent no.1. 33.There is enough material to indeed believe that opponent No.1 had no control over his vehicle and he was driving his big vehicle such as tanker on a sufficiently wide road by ignoring the circumstances on the road. The applicants have sufficed to prove that the accident has taken place due to sole mistake of opponent No.1 and he has driven his vehicle in very high speed as well in rash and negligent manner and regardless to the circumstances of the road. Therefore, issue No.1 is answered in affirmative. CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 18 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. AS TO ISSUE NO.3 AND 4 : 34.Applicant No.1 under her affidavit Exh. 36 testified that at the time of death age of her husband was 45 years and he was having good health with no bad vices. She further states that deceased Khajappa was working as Mathadi Kamgar and he was member of Mathadi, Hamal and other Shramajivi Kamgar Mandal, Pune. He was doing the work of loading and unloading cement sacks and goods in trucks. His average monthly salary was Rs.11,000/­. The deceased was contributing his whole income for welfare and wellbeing of of his family. The applicants and opponent No.4 were completely dependent upon his income. Due to accidental demise of Khajappa they have lost their sole bread earner. Therefore, applicants are claiming compensation of Rs. 25,00,000/­ towards loss of earning, loss of dependency, towards mental shock, pains and agony and loss of love and affection. 35.Opponent No.3 in their written statement have completely denied the fact that the age of deceased was 45 years, he was healthy and stout and earning average Rs.11,000/­ per month. However, the denial of opponent No.3 is evasive. Opponents have not adduced any evidence to show that the contents of applicants regarding age and income of deceased Khajappa are false and incorrect. On the contrary, the provision given in Order 8 Rule IV of Civil Procedure Code specifies that the denial must not be evasive. Similarly, it is the mandate of law as per provision laid down in Order 8 Rule V of Civil Procedure Code CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 19 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. that the denial must be specific. Therefore, the mere denial of opponent No.3 does not suffice purpose. The learned advocate of opponent No.3 has duly cross­examined applicant, but there is no material in the cross­examination to discard her contentions in respect of age and income of deceased. 36.On the other hand to prove own evidence regarding income of deceased Khajappa, applicants have examined his employer Pralhad Mankar as P.W.2 below Exh.51. It has come in his evidence that he is office bearer of Mathadi Hamal Shramajivi Kamgar Mandal, Market Yard, Pune. He is working there as inspector from 1988. He specifically states that deceased Khajappa was registered Mathadi labour of their organization. He has submitted the registration application of deceased Khajappa below Exh. 52. He has further placed on record the documents showing labour charges/ Salary paid to Khajappa during April – 2012 to March – 2015. This salary certificate is at Exh. 53. It has further come in his evidence that Khajapp died in accident on 28.01.2015. 37.The learned advocate of opponent No.3 cross­ examined this witnesses relating to some technical aspects . He admitted that the information shown in Exh.53 is not filled in computer by him. He further agreed that he did not bring record produced by Mukadam of period 2012 to 2015. However, these facts do not go to the root of the matter and they are not sufficient to discard the evidence in respect of income of deceased Khajappa. CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 20 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. 38.On perusal of Exh.52 it can be noted that deceased Khajappa had applied in year 2006 to register his name as a labour with Pune Mathadi Hamal Shramajivi Kamgar Mandal. Most importantly Exh.53 displays the salary drawn by Khajappa between period April – 2012 to February – 2015. On careful perusal of salary certificate Exh.53, it transpires that the salary of Khajappa was fluctuating and it varies between 18161/­ to 9370/­ between period February – 2014 to January 2015. It is specific contetion of applicants that the average salary of Khajappa Rs.11,000/­ per month. After having glance to statistics in the salary certificate of Khajappa in Exh. 53 it can be safely inferred that indeed average salary of Khajappa was around Rs.11,000/­ per month. 39.The learned advocate of opponent No.3 strongly submitted that there is no strict and reliable documentary evidence in respect of monthly earning of Khajapp. However, this proposition of opponent No.3 is not fully accurate. The applicant has adduced documentary evidence such as registration certificate Exh. 52 and salary certificate Exh.53. In addition to that applicants have adduced evidence of employer. In this background reliance can be placed upon the judgment of Hon'ble Bombay High in case of New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Pratiksha Kulkarni 2019 (4) All MR 812 . In this judgment Hon'ble High Court observed that ­ when employer of deceased is examined, other supportive evidence in the form of account or other documents, not at all necessary to prove monthly or annual income of deceased. 40.Apart from that in support of above said proposition, reliance can be placed upon judgment of Uma CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 21 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. Sharmay Vs. Avtar Singh 2012 ACJ 2515 . It is observed that­ when the monthly income is not proved, then compensation can be granted on the basis of minimum wages payable at relevant time . 41.Similarly Hon'ble Supreme Court in the judgment S. Manickam Vs. M.T. Corp Ltd. 2013 (5) ALL MR 477 SC observed that ­ while determining just compensation approach has to be broad based and liberal . 42.Taking into consideration the ratio of above judgment and in the light of pleading and evidence of applicants I see no impediment to believe that deceased Khajappa was working as a Mathadi Kamgar and his average monthly salary was Rs.11,000/­. 43.In backdrop of oral and documentary evidence adduced by applicants and in view of the entire discussion in forgoing paragraphs, it is now well established on record that at the time of death the age of deceased Khajappa was 45 years and his monthly income was Rs.11,000/­. There are 3 living members in the family of deceased, so out of above income, 1/3 ought to have deducted towards personal and living expenditure. Indisputably the age of deceased is 45 years, so multiplier 14 is applicable. CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 22 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. Calculation of compensation in tabular form : Age : 45 years Multiplier : 14 Deduction of living expenditure: 1/3 Monthly income : Rs.11,000/­ Towards loss of dependency:Rs.11000/­ + Rs.2750/­ (25% Future prospects) = 13750/­ ­ Rs.4583/­ (1/3 living expenditure) = Rs. 9167/­ x 12 = 1,10,004 (multiplicand) Total Rs. :Rs.1,10,004/­ x 14 = Rs.15,40,056/­ (loss of dependency) Other heads :Rs. 70,000/­ (C onsortium Rs.40,000/­ + loss of love and estate Rs.15,000/­ + Funeral expenditure Rs. 15,000/­ ) Total compensation amount:Rs. 16,10,056/­ 44.Now the serious question arises, as to who is responsible to pay the compensation to applicants. The learned advocate of opponent No.3 vehemently submitted that opponent No. 3 insurance company is not liable to pay compensation, as on the date of accident the insurance policy was not existing due to non payment of premium amount. This point is discussed in much length at the time of dealing issue No.2. While deciding issue No.2 it is held that, the insurance policy was cancelled for non­payment of cheque of premium amount and the policy was not existing on the date of accident. The answer of issue No.2 is recorded in affirmative. It is clear from this aspects of the matter that the CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 23 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. insurance policy was cancelled by opponent No.3 company. 45.The learned advocate of opponent No.3 seriously disowned the liability of payment of compensation. He further vehemently submitted that the liability cannot be fastened upon opponent No.3 even under scheme of pay and recover to buttress this point the learned advocate of opponent relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Jharkhand High Court in case of National Insurance Vs. Ramjee Pandey cited supra. In this judgment Hon'ble High Court observed that – in case of dishonour of cheque towards premium amount and cancellation of policy, insurance company is not held liable to pay compensation and not directions to pay and recover can be issued to insurance company when there is no insurance policy in force. 46.In order to counter the above proposition reliance can be placed upon the judgments of Hon'ble Supreme Court viz, Pappu and others versus Vinod Kumar Lamba (2018) 3 SCC 208 and Amrit Paul Singh versus Tata AIG General Insurance company limited (2018 ) 7 SCC 558. 47.In above judgments Hon'ble Apex Court has ruled that even if breach is proved, insurance company has to pay compensation to claimants and then recover it from vehicle owner. CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 24 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. 48.Moreover even otherwise if it is assumed that the driving license of offending driver is fake, on that ground insurance company cannot claim exemption of paying compensation. In this behalf reliance can be placed upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of National Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Swaransingh and others, 2004 ACJ 1. In this judgment Hon'ble Apex Court held that – mere absence of license, fake or invalid license or disqualification of the driver for driving are not in themselves defences available to insurance company. It is further ratio of this judgment that in case of breach of terms of policy, insurance company has to satisfy the award and then recover the awarded amount from the owner or driver of truck. 49.It is clear from ratio of above judgment that, insurance company cannot escape from the liability of payment of compensation by advancing technical grounds. 50.In the light of grievance raised by opponent No.3 company the ratio of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the judgment of Daddappa and others Vs. Branch Manager, National Insurance Co. Ltd. 2008 ACJ 581, is most important and relevant. In this judgment Hon'ble Apex Court held that the cheque issued towards premium was dishonoured and insurance company had cancelled the policy, information was CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 25 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. communicated to insured and intimation was also given to RTO. Tribunal held that insurance company was liable despite cancellation of contract of insurance. However, High Court held that insurance company was not liable. Hon'ble Supreme Court in its extra ordinary jurisdiciton under Article 142 of the Constitution directed insurance company to pay the amount of compensation awarded and recover the same from owner of the vehicle as claimants hail from lowest strata of society. 51.The ratio of above judgment is squarely applicable to case in hand. The applicants are uneducated and from lowest strata of society. It cannot be lost of sight that their only earning member was working as a labour. Hence, applicants are weak and downtrodden, therefore, it would be most difficult from them to recover compensation amount from and driver of offending vehicle. Considering this aspect the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Daddappa cited above, laid down a ratio that the insurance company shall pay the compensation amount to applicants and later on recover it from driver and owner of vehicle. 52.Taking into account the ratio and analogy of the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court cited above there is no impediment whatsoever to direct opponent No.3 to pay the compensation amount and recover the same from opponent No.1 and 2. CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 26 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. 53.To sum up applicants are entitled for Rs. Rs.15,40,056 /­ towards loss of dependency and Rs. 70,000/­ towards consortium, towards loss of love, estate and towards funeral expenses. Thus, applicants are entitled to compensation of Rs. 16,10,056 /­. 54. It has sufficiently come on record that the accident has taken place due to rash and negligent driving of Tanker car No. MH­12­HD­53 owned by opponent No.2 and driven by opponent No.1 and opponent No.3 is insurer of said vehicle. Therefore, they all are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation together with interest. However, in the light of ratio of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the judgment of Daddappa cited supra opponent No.3 is entitled to recover compensation amount from opponent Nos. 1 and 2 after its payment to applicant. 55.The applicant has claimed interest at the rate of 18% per annum. However taking into consideration present rate of interest given by Nationalized Bank and the mandate of Hon'ble Supreme Court in this behalf applicant is entitled for interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of application until actual realization of amount. 56.After having a glance to the matter, it suffices to say that applicant is entitled to compensation as provided CNR : MHPU01­005792­2015 27 Motor Accident Claim Petition No.268/2015 Basavva Naykode & Ors. Vs. Suresh Bangar & Ors. under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act. Therefore, issue No.3 is answered in partly affirmative and in answer to issue No. 4 following order is passed : O R D E R 1]The application is partly allowed with costs. 2]opponent Nos. 1, 2 and 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation of Rs.16,10,056/­ (Rupees Sixteen Lacs Ten Thousand and Fifty Six only) including NFL claim awarded under section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act. 3]Out of above compensation amount applicant No. 1, 2 and 3 are entitled to 33.33 % each. 4]Opponents shall pay compensation amount along with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of petition, till realization of entire amount within 30 days of passing of order. 5]Opponent No.3 is at liberty to recover amount of compensation from opponent No.1 and 2 as per due procedure of law.

On 29/07/2012, applicant­ was riding Activa scooter bearing registration No.MH/14/CA/7075 (hereinafter referred as ''the scooter). Applicant was to take U turn and therefore, halted the scooter on Dalvi Nagar road, near Premlok park, Chinchwad, Pune (hereinafter referred as ''the place of occurrence''). At that time, Bajaj Pulsar motorcycle bearing registration No.MH/14/DG/4930 (hereinafter referred as ''the offending motorcycle''), which was being driven by Nitin Subhash Nalawade (hereinafter referred as '' offending motorcycle rider) came in a high and excessive speed and gave dash to the Scooter. Immediately after the accident, Police P. Chinchwad took the cognizance and registered the offence vide crime No.3188/2012 against the offending motorcycle rider. Dash was so powerful, due to which, applicant fell down and sustained grievous injuries. She was initially admitted to Chaityana hospital and thereafter to Smt. Kashibai Navale Medical College and General hospital, Pune. Applicant was treated as inpatient from 01/08/2012 to 11/08/2012. During treatment period, surgery was performed on left knee of applicant. Applicant has spent huge amount towards medical and allied 3 MACP NO.65/2015 expenses. She has also spent more than Rs.10,000/­ towards Conveyance and Rs.5,000/­ towards special diet etc. It is stated that the applicant is housewife and was doing tailoring work at home. Her earning from tailoring work was Rs.6,000/­ per month. Due to accidental injuries, she is unable to do tailoring work and thereby sustained loss of future income. 3.It is stated that opponent No.1 was registered owner of the offending motorcycle and the same was insured with opponent No.2–Bajaj Allianz Insertion co.ltd. (hereinafter referred as ''the opponent No.2''). It is specifically contended the offending motorcycle rider was riding the offending motorcycle under the instructions of opponent No.1. Therefore, opponents are vicariously liable to pay the just and reasonable compensation of Rs.3 lakh to the applicant. 4.Opponent No.1 though served vide notice Exh.08, but did not appear. Therefore, claim application is proceeded exparte against him. Order to that extent is passed below Exh.1 dated 11/03/2017. 5.Opponent No.2 has filed its written statement below Exh.12. It is admitted that opponent No.1 had interest in the offending motorcycle and motorcycle was insured with it. It is denied that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending motorcycle rider. Age, income and occupation of the applicant have been denied. It is denied that applicant has spent huge amount on her medical treatment and hospitalization. It is also denied that the applicant has sustained permanent disability and the said disability affects on her functional capacity. It is denied that applicant was doing tailoring work and her monthly income was Rs.6,000/­ per month. In addition to this, it is also submitted that the offending motorcycle rider was not holding valid and effective driving 4 MACP NO.65/2015 license. With this, it is requested to dismiss the claim application. 6.On the rival contentions of the parties, Issues are framed at Exh.14. Those are reproduced below with my findings against each of them, for the reasons to follows­ Sr. No.Issues Findings 1Does applicant prove that she has sustained permanent disablement and injuries in motor vehicular accident caused on 29/07/2012 at about 20 hours, near Premlok Park, Dalvi Nagar road, Chinchwad, Pune by rash and negligent driving of Bajaj Pulsar Two Wheeler bearing registration No. MH/12/DG/4930? Yes 2Whether the claim is bad for non joinder of necessary parties?No 3Whether applicant is entitled to compensation, If yes, a) from whom and b) to what amount?As per final order 4What order and Award? As per final order R E A S O N S 7. In order to prove the claim application, applicant has examined herself below Exh.23, AW­2­ Dr. Madan S. Hardikar (Exh.36) and closed the evidence vide pursis (Exh.38). As against this, opponent No.2 has examined OW­1­ Rohan Ramesh Undale, authorized representative of opponent No.2 below Exh.41 and closed the evidence vide pursis (Exh.46). Apart from oral evidence, applicant and opponent No.2 have filed certain documents on record and I will refer the same as and when required during course of discussion. 5 MACP NO.65/2015 8.Admitted facts of the case :­ Applicant met with motor vehicular accident on 29/07/2012, involving offending motorcycle. Police P. S. Chinchwad took the cognizance of the accident and registered the offence vide Crime No.3188/2012 under section 279, 337, 424 of the Indian Penal Code and 3(1) 181, 119/177, 184, 185 of the Motor Vehicles Act against the offending motorcycle rider. It is not disputed that the offending motorcycle rider was riding the motorcycle under the instructions of opponent No.1. Opponent No.1 was registered owner of the offending motorcycle, which was insured with opponent No.2. 9. As to Issue No.1:­ Applicant is victim and an eye witness of the accident, therefore, she is material witness. Her evidence is below Exh.23. I have gone through her evidence very minutely. On going through the same, it is come to my notice that on 29/07/2012, applicant was riding the scooter. On that day, at about 08 p.m., she reached to the place of occurrence to take U turn or to cross the road, for that she halted her scooter. At that moment, the offending motorcycle came there in a high and excessive speed. Offending motorcycle rider was rash and negligent in his riding. He did not give any heed towards traffic and straightway dashed to the scooter. Impact was so severe, due to which, applicant fell down from scooter and sustained injuries. Evidence of applicant remained intact even during course of cross­examination. This apart, immediately after the accident, Police P. S. Chinchwad rushed to the place of occurrence, enquired into to the matter, took the cognizance and registered the offence vide Crime No.3188/2012 against the offending motorcycle rider. Copy of police papers are filed such as FIR (Exh.24), copy of Police statement of applicant (Exh.26), police statement of Pappu Naik 6 MACP NO.65/2015 (Exh.27), Uttam Chaure (Exh.28), spot panchanama (Exh.29), Form Comp AA (Exh.30). On going through the same, it is crystal clear transpired that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of offending motorcycle rider, who was riding the motorcycle under the instructions of opponent No.1­registered owner of the offending motorcycle. 10.It is the contention of applicant that she has sustained multiple injuries in the accident. According to her, immediately after the accident, she was initially admitted to Chaintanya hospital, Chinchwad. Her condition was deteriorated, therefore, she was shifted to Kashibai Naval Medical college and General hospital, Pune. She was treated inpatient from 01/08/2012 to 11/08/2012. Her evidence has not been challenged seriously. In order to prove the injuries, applicant has examined AW­2­ Dr. Madan Hardikar below Exh.36. He stated that the applicant has sustained fracture injuries on left knee. This apart, applicant has filed discharge card issued by Kashibai Naval Medical college and General hospital, Pune and medical bills collectively below Exh.47 Evidence of AW­1 and AW­2, so also, the medical papers go to show that applicant has sustained fracture injuries on the left knee in the accident. 11.So far as disability is concerned, there is absolutely no pleading that applicant has sustained permanent/partial disability because of accidental injuries. However, she stated during course of chief examination that she has sustained permanent disability. Evidence affidavit came to be filed on 01/10/2016. Till that date, disability certificate was not filed on record, nor same was obtained. In order to prove the disability, applicant has examined AW­2­Dr. Hardikar below Exh.36. On going through his evidence, it is come to 7 MACP NO.65/2015 my notice that he is not treating doctor. Accident took place in the year 2012. He assessed the disability of applicant after gap of five years i.e. on 20/02/2017. There is no document placed before court either by applicant or by Dr. Hardikar that on what basis and on what examination, he assessed the disability. This apart, the applicant has taken treatment from Kashibai Naval Medical college and General hospital, Pune. The said hospital issued Form Comp B. It is at Exh.48. It is declared in the said certificate that the applicant has no deformity. In view of Form Comp B (Exh.48), I am not satisfied with the disability certificate of Dr. Hardikar issued by him below Exh.37 and hold that disability assessed by AW­2­ DR. Hardikar on the higher side. Considering the injuries caused to the applicant, evidence on record, I hold that applicant has sustained partial disability to the extent of 10%. Therefore, my answer to Issue No.1 is in the affirmative. 12.As to Issue No.2:­ It has been argued by learned advocate for opponent No.2 that the scooter and its insurance company were necessary to the claim application. They are not added in the array of opponent. Therefore, it is requested to dismiss the claim holding that it is bad under law. Claim and grievances of applicant are only against the opponents. No relief is asked against the scooter owner and its insurance company, therefore, I am of the view that they are not necessary parties to the claim application. Apart from that, effective decree/award can be passed even in absence of registered owner of scooter and its insurance company as a party. Therefore, claim application is not bad for non­joinder of necessary parties. Therefore, my answer to Issue No. 2 is in the negative. 13.As to Issue Nos. 3 and 4 :­ Under the Motor Vehicles Act, injured or the dependents of the deceased, are entitled for 8 MACP NO.65/2015 compensation mainly under two heads viz. Pecuniary damages and non pecuniary damages. Pecuniary damages seeks to compensation those losses, which can be translated into money term like loss of earning actual and prospective earning and other out of pocket expenses. In contrast, non­pecuniary damages includes such immeasurable element as pain and sufferings and loss of amenities and enjoyment of life. 14. Expenses relating to treatment, hospitalization and Medicines As per evidence on record, it can safely be said that the accident took place 29/07/2012 at about 08 p.m., as a result of which, applicant sustained injuries. Therefore, applicant was initially shifted to Chaitanya hospital and thereafter to Kashibai Naval Medical college and General hospital, Pune. She was treated as an inpatient from 01/08/2012 to 11/08/2012. it has been stated by applicant that she has spent Rs.50,000/­ and an allied expenses. It is true that applicant has not examined treating doctor, so also billing clerk of the said hospital. However, applicant has produced discharge card and original medical purchased receipts below exh.47. Original bills have not been challenged by the opponents on the ground that the bills are fake, frivolous and bogus. Therefore, in view of judgment of Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of Dr. Dattatraya Laxman Shinde Vs. Nana Raghunath Hire and others (2013 ACJ 474), medical bills can be read in evidence. On going through the said medical purchased receipts, it has come to my notice that applicant has spent Rs.1,833/­ on his hospitalization and medical treatment. Therefore, I hold that applicant has spent Rs.1,833/­ towards hospitalization and medical treatment. As such, applicant is entitled to Rs.1,833/­ towards 9 MACP NO.65/2015 hospitalization and medical treatment. 15.Transportation It has come on record that the applicant was initially admitted to Chaintayna hospital, Chinchwad and thereafter to Kashibai Naval Medical college and General hospital, Pune. She was treated as inpatient from 01/08/2012 to 11/08/2012. Therefore, applicant must have spent Rs.10,000/­ towards Conveyance. Therefore, applicant is entitled to Rs.10,000/­ towards Conveyance. 16. Nourishing Food Applicant has sustained injuries in vehicular accident. In this circumstance, she must have spent some amount on nourishing food with hopes that same would be beneficial to the applicant. Therefore, applicant is entitled to Rs.10,000/­ towards Special Diet. 17. Loss of earning and other gains In order to assess of loss of earning capacity of applicant, first of all, I have to mention here that I have already held that the applicant has sustained permanent disability to the extent of 10%. Therefore, applicant is entitled to Rs.10,000/­ under the head of permanent disability. 18.So far as the assessment of loss of earning capacity on account of disability and loss of income during treatment period, it is necessary to assess the monthly or yearly income of the applicant prior to the accident. According to applicant, she was doing tailoring work and her monthly income from it was Rs.6,000/­. Evidence of applicant has not been challenged seriously. It is only suggested that she was not earning Rs.6,000/­ per month. Applicant has denied the said suggestion. In support of her evidence, applicant has filed the certificates of Tailoring (Exh.49) and certificate of Fashining Designing 10 MACP NO.65/2015 (Exh. 50). On the basis of evidence and documents referred above, it can safely be said that applicant is having skill of tailoring work. Therefore, I hold that applicant must have earned Rs.6,000/­ per month. It is pertinent that it is come on record that the applicant has sustained disability to the extent of 10%. But there is no satisfactory evidence to hold that the said disability affects on functional capacity of applicant. Therefore, applicant is not entitled to any compensation under the head of Future loss of income. However, considering the nature of accidental injuries caused to the applicant and her medical treatment etc., I hold that she was not in a position to do the work of tailoring work atleast for three months after the accident. Therefore, I hold that applicant is entitled to (Rs.6,000/­ x 3 months) Rs. 18,000/­ under the head loss loss income. 19. Non Pecuniary damages (Damages for Pains and sufferings) It has come on record that applicant has sustained injuries in the accident. He was initially admitted to Chaintanya hospital, Chinchwad, Pune and thereafter to Kashibai Navale Medical College and General Hospital, Pune. She was treated as an inpatient. She was in pain. Therefore, applicant is entitled to Rs.30,000/­ under the head of Pains and Sufferings. As such, applicant is entitled to total compensation of Rs.79,833/­ rounded off Rs.79,850/­ (inclusive of interim compensation awarded under section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act). 20.Question is from whom the applicant is entitled to recover the compensation amount. Advocate Shri. Abhang for insurance company argued that offending motorcycle rider was not holding effective and valid driving license to drive the offending 11 MACP NO.65/2015 motorcycle. He further argued that the opponent No.1 owner of the motorcycle had handed over the offending motorcycle and therefore, motorcycle rider was contravened the terms and conditions of insurance policy. It is needless to say that unless and until, there is pleading that opponent No.1­registered owner of the offending motorcycle was aware or noticed that the offending motorcycle rider was not holding valid and effective driving license at the time of accident, till then it cannot be said that opponent No.1 breached the terms and conditions of insurance policy. Herein this case, nowhere it is pleaded that opponent No.1 had knowledge that offending motorcycle rider was not holding valid and effective driving license and he willfully handed over the offending motorcycle to him. Therefore, it cannot be said that opponent No.1 committed breach of terms and conditions of insurance policy. On this point, I am relying upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Premkumari and others Vs. Pralhad Deo and others (AIR 2008 SC 1073), in which, it is observed that ­ '' liability of insurer – driver having fake license not by itself sufficient to absolve insurer of liability ­ It has further to prove that the owner was aware or noticed that license was fake and still permitted driver to drive'' 21. In order to prove the defence of fake driving license, insurance company has examined its witness Rohan Undale as OW­1 below Exh.41. By referring his evidence, Adv. Shri.Abhang for insurance company submitted that notice (Exh.45) was issued to the opponent No.1 and asked him to supply the driving license of offending motorcycle rider. Notice was served to him. He did not give any response. Therefore, it is requested that adverse inference be taken against opponent No.1. On going through the evidence and 12 MACP NO.65/2015 notice, postal acknowledgement (Exh.45), it transpired to me that notice was issued in the name of opponent No.1, but the same was not served against him. Same is served to Alka Ghodke. Her signature is appearing on postal acknowledgement (Exh.45). There is no evidence before me about the relationship in between opponent No.1 and Alka Ghodke. Therefore, I am of the view that the notice has not been served against opponent No.1. Therefore, there is no question to draw the adverse inference against opponent No.1. Defence of fake driving license is taken by the insurance company. Therefore, it was incumbent on part of insurance company to prove the same by way of cogent evidence. However, opponent No.2 failed to discharge the burden. Therefore, applicant is entitled to recover the amount of compensation of Rs.79,850/­ from opponent Nos.1 and 2. Opponent Nos.1 and 2 are jointly and severally responsible for the payment of entire compensation. 22.By keeping in mind the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Municipal Corporation of Delhi V/s. Upahar Trading Victims Association and others (2011) 14 SCC 481, I hold that claimants are entitled for interest @ of 09% per annum on the compensation amount. I, therefore answer Issue No.3 accordingly and in response to Issue No.4, I pass following order. Order 1.The application is partly allowed with proportionate costs. 2.Opponent Nos.1 and 2 shall jointly and severally deposit compensation of Rs.79,850/­ (Rs. Seventy­nine thousand eight hundred fifty only) (including interim compensation awarded u/s.140 of the Motor Vehicles Act), with interest @ 9% per annum, from 13 MACP NO.65/2015 the date of petition, till realization of entire amount within 30 days from the date of passing award. a)On depositing total compensation, it be paid to applicant by issuing account payee cheque after due identification and verification. 3.Award be drawn up accordingly. sdxxx Date – 02/01/2018 (R.H.Mohammad) Pune Member, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Pune 14 MACP NO.65/2015 “I affirm that the contents of the PDF file judgment are word to word same as per original judgment.” Name of Steno : Shri S.

On 26/10/2014, at about 1530 hours on Nagar­Pune road, near KM No.39/8, Kondhapuri, Tal. Shirur, deceased­Soni, was pillion rider on motorcycle bearing registration No.MH/14/CE/2108 (hereinafter referred as ''the motorcycle''). Applicant was riding the motorcycle in a moderate speed and with all precautions. They were coming to Pune. At that time, Trailer bearing registration No.CG/04/JA/3185 (hereinafter referred as ''the offending Trailer'') came from their back side i.e. from Nagar side in a high and excessive speed and gave dash to the motorcycle. Its driver was rash and negligent in his driving. Applicant and deceased­Soni fell down. Deceased­Soni sustained multiple injuries and passed away. It is stated that police P. S. Ranjangaon, Pune took the cognizance of the accident and registered the offence vide Crime no.30/2014 under section 279, 304­A, 338 of the Indian Penal code and 184 of the M. V. Act against the driver­ Sahebrao Jagatram Barali (hereinafter referred as ''the offending Trailer driver''). 3.It is contended that opponent No.1 was owner of the offending trailer and same was insured with opponent No.2­ SBI General Insurance Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred as ''the opponent No.2). Therefore, the opponents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the applicant. 4.Opponent No.1 though duly served but failed to appear. 3 MACP No.71/2015 Therefore, claim application is proceeded exparte against him. 5.Opponent No.2 has filed its written statement below Exh.16. It is admitted that opponent No.1 was owner of the offending trailer and same was insured with it. It is denied that the accident caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending trailer. Age, income and occupation of the deceased­Soni have also been denied. It is the defence that driver of offending trailer was not holding valid and effective driving license. With this, it is requested to dismiss the claim application. 6.On the rival contentions of the parties, Issues are framed at Exh.18. Those are reproduced below with my findings against each of them, for the reasons to follows­ Sr. No.Issues Findings 1 Do the applicants prove that deceased ­ Soni B. Lokhande died in the motor vehicular accident, caused on 26/10/2014 at about 15­30 hours on Nagar­ Pune road, near K. M. No.39/8, Kondhapuri,Tal. Shirur by rash and negligent driving of Trailer Vehicle bearing registration No.CG/04/JA/3185? Yes 2 Whether applicants are entitled to compensation, If yes, a) from whom and b) to what amount?As per final order 3 What order and Award? As per final order R E A S O N S 7. In order to prove the claim application, applicant has examined himself as AW­1 below Exh.19 and closed evidence vide pursis (Exh31). Opponent No.2 did not enter into witness box and 4 MACP No.71/2015 closed the evidence vide pursis (Exh.32). Apart from oral evidence, applicant has relied on the police papers of Crime No. 30/2014 of P. S. Ranjangaon, Pune such as FIR (Exh. 20), Spot panchanama (Exh.21), Inquest panchanama (Exh.22), Cause of Death certificate (Exh.23), Postmortem report (Exh.24), Death certificate issued By PMC (Exh.25), Form Comp AA (26), Driving license of offending trailer driver (Exh.27), Fitness certificate (Exh.28), Insurance policy (Exh. 29). 8.Admitted fact of the case ­ Applicant is widower of deceased­Soni. Deceased Soni died in a motor vehicular accident on 26/10/2014 involving offending Trailer. It is admitted that P. S. Ranjangaon took the cognizance of the accident and registered the offence vide Crime no.30/2014 against the offending trailer driver. It is admitted that the opponent No.1 was registered owner of the offending trailer and the same was insured with opponent No.2 9.As to Issue No. 1:­ AW­1 is widower of deceased­Soni. He is victim and also an eye witness of the accident. His evidence is below Exh.19. On going through the evidence, it reveals to me that on the date of accident, he was driving the motorcycle. Deceased­Soni was pillion rider. He was coming to Pune. Motorcycle was in a moderate speed. It further revealed that the motorcycle was on extreme left side of road. Applicant reached to the place of occurrence. At that time, the offending trailer came from Nagar side i.e. from the backside of the applicant. It was in a high and excessive speed. Offending Trailer was carrying heavy goods, therefore, it was for offending trailer driver to go slow. He did not follow the rule. He was rash and negligent and therefore, the accident occurred. Record 5 MACP No.71/2015 further goes to show that the Police P. S. Ranjangaon took the cognizance of the accident, registered the crime vide Crime No. 30/2014 and investigate and filed the charge sheet against the offending trailer driver. On going through the police papers such as FIR, spot panchanama, inquest panchanama, postmortem report etc. it is come to my notice that the offending trailer driver was only responsible for the accident. He was rash and negligent at the time of driving. Therefore, I hold that applicant has proved that d eceased­ Soni died in the motor vehicular accident, caused on 26/10/2014 at about 15­30 hours on Nagar­Pune road, near K. M. No.39/8, Kondhapuri,Tal. Shirur by rash and negligent driving of the offending Trailer. Therefore, my answer to Issue No.1 is in the affirmative. 10.As to Issue Nos. 2 and 3 :­ Compensation under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act is based on the age, income and occupation of the deceased. It has been deposed by AW­1 that deceased­Soni was 38 years old on the date of accident. His evidence has not been challenged seriously. Age of Soni is cited as 38 years in Inquest panchanama (Exh.22) and Postmortem (Exh.24). The said documents have also not been challenged by insurance company. Therefore, I have no hesitation to hold that deceased­Soni was 38 years on the date of accident. Multiplier applicable to the age group of 36 to 40 years is 15. 11.So far as income of deceased­Soni is concerned, it is deposed by AW­1 that she was doing household work and also working as a labour. Her monthly income from all sources was Rs.10,000/­. There is no satisfactory evidence that deceased­Soni was doing labour work in addition to household work. Therefore, I hold 6 MACP No.71/2015 that deceased­Soni was housewife. The services of housewife or a mother cannot be counted in money or cash. The gratuitous services rendered by wife to the husband can not be equated with the services of employee and no evidence or data can possibly be produced for estimating the value of such services. It is virtually impossible to measure in terms of money, the loss of personal care and attention suffered by husband on the demise of housewife. Therefore, in view of Judgment of Hon'ble Supreme court in the case of Arunkumar Agrawal and another Vs. National Insurance co.Ltd. And others (2010 ACJ SC 2161) , I hold that her income is to be assessed Rs.5,000/­ per month and thus yearly income of comes to Rs.60,000/­. At the same time, in view of Judgment of Hon'ble Delhi High court in the case of Rampal and another Vs. Banvari Lal and others (2011 ACJ 998) and also in view of judgment of Hon'ble Punjab and Haryana High Court in the case of Paramjit Singh and another Vs. Dilbagh Singh and others (2014 ACJ 1817, the personal deductions of deceased is not permissible. As such, by applying multiplier 15 to the yearly income of deceased­ Soni, Rs.60,000/­, total loss of dependency of applicants on the income of deceased comes to Rs.9,00,000/­. In addition to this, applicant being widower is entitled to get compensation of Rs.40,000/­ towards Loss of Consortium. Applicant is also entitled to compensation of Rs.15,000/­ towards Funeral Expenses and Rs.15,000/­ towards Loss of Estate as observed by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay and others (Special Leave petition (Civil) No.25590 of 2014). As such, applicant being legal heir is entitled to total compensation of Rs.9,70,000/­ inclusive of interim compensation awarded under 7 MACP No.71/2015 section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act) from opponent Nos.1 and 2. Opponent Nos. 1 and 2 are jointly and severally responsible for the payment of entire compensation. 12.By keeping in mind the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Municipal Corporation of Delhi V/s. Upahar Trading Victims Association and others (2011) 14 SCC 481, I hold that claimant is entitled for interest @ 09% per annum on the compensation amount. I, therefore answer Issue No.2 accordingly and in response to Issue No.3, I pass following order. Order 1.The application is partly allowed with proportionate costs. 2.Opponent Nos. 1 and 2 shall jointly and severally deposit compensation of Rs.9,70,000/­ (Rs. Nine lakh seventy thousand only) (including interim compensation awarded u/s.140 of the Motor Vehicles Act), with interest @ 9% per annum, from the date of petition, till realization of entire amount within 30 days from the date of passing award. a)Out of total compensation, amount of Rs.4,00,000/­ (Rs. Four lakh only) be invested in Fixed deposit in the name of applicant in any nationalized bank of his choice for a period of three years, and balance amount be paid to him by issuing account payee cheque after due identification and verification. 3.Award be drawn up accordingly.

Claim of Rs. 10,00,000/­ J U D G M E N T (Delivered on this 12 th Day of March 2020 ) 1­By way of this petition under section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act applicants have claimed compensation in respect of death of Madhukar Gangaram Navjekar in motor vehicular accident caused on 08.05.2015. 2­Facts of the applicants’ case are as under : The accident took place on 08.05.2015 at about 6.30 p.m. at Bhalekar Chowk, Jyotibanagar, Talwade, Pune. At that time deceased, after completing his duty, was proceeding towards home on bicycle. When he reached near the spot of occurrence, one Maximo Plus bearing registration No. MH­14­EM­3094 proceeding in same direction gave forceful dash to deceased's bicycle. It was being driven by its driver in high and excessive speed without observing traffic rules. Due to dash, deceased sustained severe injuries to vital organs and succumbed to them. 3­Police of Nigdi Police station carried out investigation and registered an offence against driver of the Maximo Plus under the various sections of Indian Penal Code as well as Motor Vehicles Act. CNR No. 3 M.A.C.P. No. 461/2015 MHPU01­010372­2015 Judgment 4­It is further contended that the deceased was 59 years old. He was serving in ' Perfect Coating ' as a helper and earning salary of Rs.12,000/­ per month. Due to untimely death of deceased, applicants have suffered great mental and financial loss. Therefore, they claimed compensation along with interest from all the opponents. 5­Opponent No. 1 though duly served vide Exh. 12 remained absent. Hence application proceeded exparte against him. 6­ The Opponent No. 2, Insurance Company has filed its written statement below Exh. 10. All the averments regarding age, income, occupation, dependency and negligence are specifically denied. According to Opponent No.2 the driver of offending vehicle, at the relevant time was not holding valid and effective driving licence. As such due to breach of terms and condition of policy, they are not liable to pay compensation. Hence opponent No.2, prayed for dismissal of the claim against it. 7­Considering rival pleadings, following issues were framed by my learned predecessor below E xh. 30. I have reproduced the same along with my findings thereon for the reasons given below. CNR No. 4 M.A.C.P. No. 461/2015 MHPU01­010372­2015 Judgment Sr. No. Issues Findings 1Do the applicants prove that deceased Madhukar Gangaram Navjekar died in the motor vehicular accident, caused on 08.05.2015 at about 6.30. p.m., at Bhalekar chowk, Jyotibanagar, Talwade, Pune by rash and negligent driving of Maximo plus bearing No. MH­14­EM­3094 ?In the affirmative. 2Whether applicants are entitled to compensation, If yes, (a) from whom and to what amount ? Yes Rs. 7,31,000/­ from opponent Nos. 1 and 2 3What order and Award ? As per final order. R E A S O N S Admitted facts 8­The involvement of Maximo Plus bearing registration No. MH­14­EM­3094 is admitted. The deceased sustained multiple injuries in accident and succumbed to them. An offence was registered against driver of Maximo Plus vehicle. As to Issue No.1:­ 9­In support of contentions, applicant No. 2 examined himself at Exh. 18. Along with oral testimony, applicants also relied upon documentary evidence like complaint Exh. 20, F.I.R. Exh. 21, Spot Panchanama Exh. 22, Inquest panchanama Exh. 23, Cause of death certificate Exh. 24, Form Comp AA Exh. 25 and copy of Insurance of offending CNR No. 5 M.A.C.P. No. 461/2015 MHPU01­010372­2015 Judgment vehicle Exh. 26. The relevant documentary evidence would be appreciated as and where required during the course of discussion. 10­Applicant, AW­1 specifically deposed as to how accident took place. Admittedly he is not an eye witness. His evidence is based on police papers. It has come on record that, at the time of accident the father of the applicant No. 2 was returning to home on his bicycle. When he reached near the spot of occurrence the offending Maximo Jeep which was being driven very rashly and negligently dashed to bicycle from behind. The evidence of this witness is fully corroborated by the contents of police papers. The spot panchanama also clearly shows that, the offending vehicle which was being driven very speedily, dashed to bicycle from back side. The dash was so forceful that the deceased sustained multiple injuries to vital organs and succumbed to them. The factum of negligence is also not seriously disputed by the opponent. 11­Moving further, cause of death certificate (Exh. 24) shows that death occurred due to injuries to vital organs. Those were caused due to accident only. The evidence on the record also clearly establish that due to rash and negligent act of the driver of Maximo plus, accident took place. As a result of it, Madhukar Gangaram Navjekar died. I, therefore, hold that applicants prove that deceased CNR No. 6 M.A.C.P. No. 461/2015 MHPU01­010372­2015 Judgment Madhukar Gangaram Navjekar died in the motor vehicular accident, caused on 08.05.2015 at about 6.30. p.m., at Bhalekar chowk, Jyotibanagar, Talwade, Pune by rash and negligent driving of Maximo plus bearing No. MH­14­EM­ 3094. Hence I answer Issue No.1 in the affirmative. As to Issue No. 2 :­ 12­The opponent Insurance company, come up with specific defence that, the driver was not having valid driving licence. Written notes of argument (Exh. 56) are filed on record by the insurance company. At the outset it is necessary to mention here that, though as much as 11 case laws are relied in written notes of argument, not a single citation is furnished. It appears that, only relevant paras which suits to insurance company are mentioned in written notes. Needless to say unless and until entire citation is gone through, only picked up paras mentioned in written notes cannot be considered. 13­As far as defence is concerned, the insurance company has furnished extract of driving licence (Exh.53) of the driver of offending vehicle. It shows that, at the relevant time of accident, the driver was holding licence only for motor­cycle with gear. Admittedly, the driver was driving Maximo Plus (Four wheeler) at the time of accident. It is, therefore, submitted by Insurance company that, they are not liable to pay any amount and insurance company be CNR No. 7 M.A.C.P. No. 461/2015 MHPU01­010372­2015 Judgment exonerated completely. 14­It is settled principle of law that, in the claims before tribunal, a decision has to be taken considering the fact whether the the driver possessing licence for one type of vehicle but found driving another type of vehicle, was the 'main and contributory cause ' of accident. In the case at hand despite filing extract of driving licence (Exh. 53), the insurance company chose not to adduce any evidence. It is necessary that, the insurance company must not only established the available defence but must also establish breach on the part of the owner of the vehicle. As already discussed not a single witness is examined by the insurance company. It is not proved that, the driver was holding one type of licence and driving another type of vehicle was the main and contributory cause of accident. So also, in absence of any independent evidence or witness alleged breach is also not proved. 15­Here reference of Hon'ble Apex Court in 2008 ACJ 1928 Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. V/s Zaharulnisha and others would be necessary. In the case law cited above, the driver had licence to drive Heavy Motor Vehicle but he was driving two­wheeler scooter which hit a cycle and the cyclist sustained fatal injuries. Though it is held that, driver was not having valid and effective licence and insurance company was not liable to pay compensation, it is further directed that, the CNR No. 8 M.A.C.P. No. 461/2015 MHPU01­010372­2015 Judgment insurance company shall satisfy the award first and have right to recover the amount from owner. 16­In the case at hand also the driver was having licence to drive motor­cycle with gear only. He was found driving Maximo Jeep at the time of accident. Despite due service of summons, the driver cum owner least bothered to appear in the matter and contest the same. In such situation pay and recover order shall meet the ends of justice. As such what remains to be decided is 'just compensation'. 17­While deciding compensation, it is necessary to determine income of the deceased first. The applicants examined employer Shri Aniket Ashutosh Datir, AW2, (Exh.32) to prove income. He deposed that, deceased was working with him as a helper from 01.09.2014 and his monthly salary was Rs. 12,000/­. He furnished and proved salary certificate (Exh. 33). However, in the cross­ examination he admitted that, he has no documentary evidence to prove that, deceased was his employee. He also admitted that, he was not maintaining any muster roll regarding attendance or issuing voucher or receipts to show cash payment. As such evidence of this witness is not acceptable. 18­Still fact remains that, the deceased was 58 years old. He was satisfactorily maintaining his entire family. As such only because there is no proof of income, he cannot be CNR No. 9 M.A.C.P. No. 461/2015 MHPU01­010372­2015 Judgment labelled as a useless member of family. Looking to the age and liabilities of the deceased, if at all notional income of Rs. 10,000/­ would be considered, it will be justifiable. 19­Looking to the age of deceased, multiplier of 9 would be applicable. There are two dependents shown in the title clause. However, applicant No. 2 is a major and employed son. As such he cannot be termed as totally dependent on deceased. In such case, only widow being dependent, one half amount shall be deducted towards personal expenses. So also 15% amount is required to be added towards future prospects. In such scenario the arithmetical calculation would be as follows : Sr. No. Head Compensation awarded iIncome Rs.10,000/­ iiFuture prospects Rs.1,500/­(15% of Rs.10,000/­) iiiDeduction towards personal expenditure Rs.5,750/­ ( 1/2 amount) ivTotal Income : Rs.5,750/­ vMultiplier 9 viTowards dependency Rs.6,21,000/­ (Rs.5,750/­ x 12 x 9) viiLoss of love and affection Rs.80,000/­(Rs.40,000/­each) viiiFuneral expenses Rs. 15,000/­ ixLoss of estate Rs. 15,000/­ Total compensation awarded : Rs.7,31,000/­ along with interest as applicable. CNR No. 10 M.A.C.P. No. 461/2015 MHPU01­010372­2015 Judgment Interest : 20­As far as question of interest is concerned, looking to the prevailing rate of interest at the time of accident, applicant would be entitled for an interest @ 9% per annum from the date of filing of this petition till its realization. Who shall pay : 21­Admittedly, accident took place due to sole negligence of driver of offending vehicle. Opponent No.1 is owner and opponent No.2 is its insurer. Thus both the opponents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation with liberty to opponent No. 2 that it can recover the amount so paid by way of compensation from opponent No.1. Hence I answer Issue No. 2 accordingly. 20­ In sequel I pass following order. O R D E R 1­Claim Petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs. 2­Opponent Nos. 1 and 2 shall pay compensation of Rs.7,31,000/­ (Rs. Seven Lakhs Thirty One Thousand Only) including NFL amo unt to applicants with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of registration of claim till its actual realization. (a)Out of total amount of compensation of Rs. 7,31,000/­, Share of applicants would be as follows : CNR No. 11 M.A.C.P. No. 461/2015 MHPU01­010372­2015 Judgment (a)­i 70% to applicant No. 1 (i.e. Rs.5,11,700/­) (a)­ii30% to applicant No. 2 ( i.e. Rs. 2,19,300/­) (b)Out of amount of Rs.5,11,700/­ and Rs. 2,19,300/­ an amount of Rs.2,00,000/­ and Rs.1,00,000/­ respectively be kept in Fixed Deposit Receipt for a period of three years in any Nationalised bank of the choice of applicants and rest of the amount be paid to them by account payee cheque, on due verification. 2­Opponent No.2, if desired, may recover entire amount along with interest @ 9% per annum from opponent No.1 by filing execution proceeding directly. 3­Award be drawn up accordingly, after payment of deficit Court fees, if any.

Judgment in M.A.C.P.No.598/2015 ­3­ 3]On 26.09.2014, at about 5­00 p.m. Kundalik was proceeding on Motorcycle bearing no.MH­02­AZ­4813 from Pune to Nagar on Pune­Nagar Highway. The deceased was about to take right turn at “L & T” Chowk, at that time he was driving his motorcycle at a moderate speed and also gave indication. But, when he reached near Hotel Rajendra, one heavy vehicle which passed by the motorcycle at a high speed and due to which motorcycle collided on the divider and deceased fell on the other lane. At that time, Mahindra Scorpio bearing No. MH­12­GN­ 0100 belonging to opponent no.1 which was being driven rashly and negligently by opponent no.2 ran over the head of the deceased who died at the spot. After the accident the driver of opponent no. 2 neither stopped nor made any effort to provide medical aid to the deceased. At the relevant time Scorpio was insured with opponent no.3. 4]After investigation Shikrapur Police Station had registered the offences against the driver of Scorpio Jeep U/sec. 279, 304­A, 337, 338 of IPC and under Section 184 and 134/177 of Motor Vehicles Act. 5]At the relevant time deceased Kundalik was 53 years old and he was an agriculturist and also florist who used to supply flowers to Film Industry and his monthly income was Rs. 25,000 to Rs.30,000/­. The petitioners are entirely depend upon deceased for their livelihood. H ence the petitioners have claimed compensation to the tune of Rs. 26,00,400/­ from the opponents along with interest @ of 12% p.a. Judgment in M.A.C.P.No.598/2015 ­4­ 6] The opponent no.1 & 2 have filed written statement vide Exh.17 and denied the adverse contents. The opponents have specifically denied that accident occurred due to involvement and rash and negligent driving of driver of Scorpio. It is further denied about the age, income, occupation and dependency. It is further denied that deceased intended to take a right turn at “L & T” Chowk and at the relevant time he was driving bike at a moderate speed. 7]On the contrary, it is contended by the opponents that deceased was proceeding towards Nagar Side on Pune­Nagar Highway which is four lane and there is divider between center of the road. Therefore, there is no question of negligence and collusion between the Bike and Scorpio. As the deceased was driving the motorcycle at a high speed he was unable to control it and dashed to the divider and fell on the southern side of the divider and died on the spot. At the relevant time the deceased was not having valid and effective driving license nor wearing helmet which is mandatory on the highway. Therefore, petitioners are not entitled to claim any sort of compensation from the aforesaid opponents. 8]The opponent no. 3 has filed written statement vide Exh. 48 and denied the adverse contents. The opponents have specifically denied that accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of driver of Scorpio. It is further denied about the age, income, occupation and dependency. It is contended by opponent no. 3 that on the day of the accident Scorpio jeep Judgment in M.A.C.P.No.598/2015 ­5­ involved in the accident was not insured with the present opponent. Therefore, the insurance is not liable to indemnify opponent no.1 and 2 and liable to pay compensation. It is further contended that deceased was proceeding towards Nagar Side on Pune­Nagar Highway which is four lane and there is divider between center of the road. As the deceased was driving the motorcycle at a high speed he was unable to control it and dashed to the divider and fell on the southern side of the divider and died on the spot. Therefore, driver of Scorpio is not responsible for the accident but in alternative it is contended that if tribunal comes to the conclusion that both the vehicles are negligent, then case of negligence be apportioned. At the relevant time the deceased was not having valid and effective driving license. Hence, petitioners are not entitled to claim any sort of compensation from the aforesaid opponents. 9]Considering the rival pleadings of both the parties, my learned predecessor has framed Issues at Exh.20. I have recorded my findings thereon for the reasons stated below. ISSUES FINDINGS 1)Do the petitioners prove that accident took place on 26.09.2014 at about 5­00 p.m. in front of Hotel Rajendra, at village Sanaswadi, Tal. Shirur, District Pune, due to rash and negligent driving by opponent no.2. the driver of Scorpio jeep bearing registration No. MH­12­GN­100 and ? Kundalik Namdev Hargude died due to accidental injuries ?No. Judgment in M.A.C.P.No.598/2015 ­6­ 2)Do opponents prove that the Scorpio jeep bearing registration No. MH­12­GN­100 is not involved in the accident ?Yes. 3)Do the petitioners prove that they are entitled for the compensation ? If yes, to what extent and from whom ?No. 5)Does opponent no. 2 prove that deceased was driving motorcycle without valid and effective driving license and thereby contributed accident ?Yes. 4)What order ? As per final order R E A S O N S AS TO ISSUES NO.1, 2 & 5 :­ 10]As the aforesaid issues are interlinked they are discussed together for the sake of brevity and to avoid repetition. On behalf of the petitioners, petitioner no.2 Amol Kundalik Hargude has filed his affidavit in lieu of examination­in­ chief vide Exh.23 and has stated that on 26.09.2014, at about 5­ 00 p.m. deceased was proceeding on Motorcycle bearing no.MH­ 02­AZ­4813 from Pune to Nagar on Pune­Nagar Highway. The deceased was about to take right turn at L & T Chowk and he was driving his motorcycle at a moderate speed and also gave indication. But, at that time, when he reached near Hotel Rajendra, one heavy vehicle which passed by the motorcycle at a high speed and due to which motorcycle collided on the divider and deceased fell on the other lane. At that time, Mahindra Scorpio bearing No. MH­12­GN­0100 belonging to opponent no.1 Judgment in M.A.C.P.No.598/2015 ­7­ which was being driven rashly and negligently by opponent no.2 ran over the head of the deceased who died at the spot. After the accident the driver of opponent no. 2 neither stopped nor made any effort to provide medical aid to the deceased. 11]But, it is clear that above witness was not ocular witness to the incident. During cross­examination, he has admitted that deceased was not wearing helmet at the time of accident. He has further deposed that the spot where the accident occurred is on a National Highway having width of 200 ft and it is divided by divider. He has further admitted that as one vehicle passed by the side of the motorcycle, deceased got scared and dashed against the road divider and fell down on the lane of Nagar to Pune road. He has further admitted that at the relevant time, his father was not wearing helmet and he has not produced on record driving license of his father. 12]Even though petitioners have examined Dhananjay Bapurao Darekar vide Exh. 52, who has stated that he was ocular witness to the accident. On 26.09.2014 at about 4­00 p.m. he was doing some work in front of Krishna Leela Mangal Karyalay at about 5­00 p.m. he heard a noise of bike and when he saw he noticed deceased Kundalik was proceeding from Pune to Nagar and while taking right turn he had given a indicator and reduced the speed of his motorcycle. At that time, Luxury bus passed by his motorcycle and due to which he was unable to control the motorcycle and collided with the divider. After colliding with the divider he fell on the Nagar side lane and at that time Scorpio Judgment in M.A.C.P.No.598/2015 ­8­ Jeep was coming from opposite direction ran over his head. But during cross­examination he has admitted that it was the motorcycle of deceased which had dashed against the road divider. He has further admitted that deceased died due to injuries sustained by him because he dashed to road divider. He has further admitted that there was no collusion between the motorcycle of deceased and the Scorpio Jeep. He has further admitted that half k.m. away from the spot of accident, there is access to take turn to both side of the road, he has also admitted that the photographs which are marked at Exh. 60 and 61. On perusal of the above photographs no right turn is seen at the relevant spot. 13]He has further admitted that deceased was not wearing helmet at the relevant time. Even though he has denied that deceased was not having valid license. But P.W.1 who is son of the deceased has admitted that he has not filed on record driving license of deceased. So also, opponent no. 1 and 2 had examined the driver of Scorpio vehicle vide Exh. 74, who has denied his involvement in the accident and during his cross­ examination it was brought on record that after the motorcycle had fallen on the divider the deceased had fallen on the road. It is also brought on record that he was proceeding from Shikrapur to Pune. It is also brought on record that accident did not occur due to his negligence. 14]At this juncture, learned Advocate for the opponent no.1 and 2 has drawn my attention to statement of the informant Judgment in M.A.C.P.No.598/2015 ­9­ at Exh.33 dated 14/11/2014. As per the above statement, the accident had occurred on 26.09.2014 and on inquiry with Dhananjay Bapurao Darekar, who is examined as P.W.2, has stated that deceased was his relative. At the relevant time, he was doing work in front of Krishna Mangal Karyalay at about 5­00 p.m, he heard a noise and saw that dash was given to a person who was proceeding on Nagar side by vehicle and he had fell down. It is further stated that the motorcycle dashed against the divider and after climbing the divider the motorcycle was thrown on Pune side and thereafter Scorpio Jeep which was coming on Pune side ran over his head. 15]In Exh. 33, it is further stated that it was the motorcyclist, who was rash and negligent and had dashed against the divider, due to which he sustained injuries. But surprisingly the driver of the Scorpio was prosecuted for the above accident. 16]If the above witness was eye witness to the accident, which occurred on 26.09.2014, then being a relative of deceased, he would have immediately lodged FIR in respect of the accident. But, the FIR is lodged on 14.11.2014 after elapse of about two months and in the FIR no explanation is tendered why there was delay in lodging the FIR. Therefore, the above witness appears to be a planted witness and there is every reason to doubt the truthfulness of the contents of the FIR and his version that he was ocular witness to the alleged accident. Judgment in M.A.C.P.No.598/2015 ­10­ 17]On the contrary, from the cross­examination of P.W.1 and P.W.2 it appears that deceased was driving the motorcycle at a high speed and was unable to control it. Due to which he dashed against the divider, sustained injuries and fell on Pune side lane and was thereafter ran over by the Scorpio which was coming from opposite direction. Therefore, in my opinion, it cannot be said that, driver of the Scorpio was in any manner involved and responsible for the accident. Because, he was proceeding on his correct side on Pune­Nagar Highway on Pune side lane. 18]It also appears that the deceased was not having valid and effective license at the relevant time and he was not wearing helmet which is mandatory as per Section 129 of Motor Vehicles Act. In support of the above contention learned advocate for the opponent no. 1 and 2 has relied upon one citation in the case of Ravi Shekhar Bhardwaj Vs. Director General of Police & ors 2004(2) MH.L.J. 213 . Wherein it is observed that the provisions of Section 129 of Motor Vehicles Act are mandatory and it appears that deceased Kundalik has not followed the above mandate by wearing helmet at the relevant time. 19]The learned Advocate for the opponent no. 1 and 2 has further relied on two citations on the point that evidence of eye witness is not reliable and he is a planted witness, therefore, only because charge­sheet was filed against the offending vehicle it will not be sufficient to prove the involvement of offending vehicle in the accident. Judgment in M.A.C.P.No.598/2015 ­11­ 20]Farzana Begum Abdul Khadir and ors Vs. SK. Saleem SK. Hyder and others, 2019(2) Mh.L.J. 73 In the above citation it was contended by the claimants that deceased was dashed by truck while he was returning home on a motorcycle and the accident occurred due to involvement of rash and negligent driving of the truck. But after considering entire evidence on record his Lordship came to the conclusion that the alleged eye witness was a planted witness so as to falsely show the involvement of the said truck in the alleged accident. 21]Suresh Sakharam Kadam & ors Vs. Transport Manager, Thane Municipal Transport Undertaking Thane Municipal Corpn. and other, 2017 (5) Mh.L.J. 103. In the above citation also it was the case of the claimants that motorcycle of the deceased collided with the bus. But after considering the entire evidence on record, his lordship had come to conclusion that the victim's motorcycle skidded on a patch of sand, due to which he fell down and motorcycle came under bus after hitting road divider. Therefore, evidence does not show that victim's death was due to accident arising out of use of the bus. Accordingly, the order of dismissal of claim petition by the Tribunal was confirmed by his Lordship. 22]Even though facts of both the above citations are not entirely similar to the present case but the ratio laid down in the above citations will be applicable, because in the present case it is not proved by the petitioners that Scorpio was involved in the Judgment in M.A.C.P.No.598/2015 ­12­ accident and the driver of the Scorpio was in any manner responsible for demise of Kundalik. 23]Therefore, the citations relied by the petitioners on the point of negligence in [1] Usha Rajkhowa & others Vs. Paramount Industries & others 2009 DGLS (SC) 242, [2] Sudhir Kumar Rana Vs. Surinder Singh & others 2008 DGLS (SC) 675, [3] Binny Sharma & ors Vs. Om Prakash & others AIR 2012 PAT 74 , [4] National Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Mansi Swapnil Keokar & ors 2019 DGLS(BOM) 777 , are not applicable because facts of the above case are entirely different from the present case. Hence, I answer Issue No. 1 in the Negative, Issue no. 2 in the affirmative and Issue no. 5 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO.3 & 4 : ­ 24]If the petitioners had proved Issue no. 1 in their favour, then only they will be entitled for compensation. But, the petitioners have failed to prove Issue no. 1 and disproved Issue no. 2 in their favour, therefore, they are not entitled to claim any compensation from opponent no. 1 and 2 and also from the opponent no.3. Because, at the relevant time, Scorpio was not insured with opponent no. 3 which is clear from Exh.37. Therefore, the citation relied by the learned Advocate for the applicants in respect of computation of compensation will not be applicable. [1]Sarla Varma Vs.

Narayan Reddy & ors 2013 DGLS (SC) 987 25]Be it so, the petitioner no. 2 has deposed that Kundalik was an agriculturist and florist who was supplying flowers to Film Industry and his monthly income was Rs. 25,000/­ to 30,000/­. But the petitioners have not produced on record any documentary evidence to substantiate the fact that agricultural land was standing in the name of deceased Kundalik. But they have examined one witness Nitin Dharmaraj Borude (P.W.3) vide Exh. 65 to prove the income of deceased Kundalik, he has deposed that deceased Kundalik was supplying flower and garlands to their Production house and their company was paying Rs. 25,000/­ to Rs. 30,000/­ to him per month and accordingly, he has produced on record certificate at Exh.68. 26]In the above certificate, it is mentioned that deceased used to provide flowers to the production house i.e. Cinemantra and he was paid salary to the tune of Rs. 25,000/­ to Rs. 30,000/­. But, it is not the case of the petitioners that deceased Kundalik Judgment in M.A.C.P.No.598/2015 ­14­ was salaried employee of the above Production house and it is admitted by Nitin (P.W.3) during his cross­examination that Kundalik was not a salaried employee of their company. He has further admitted that he has not produced on record any document to show that Kundalik was supplying flowers to their company. He has further admitted that he has not brought on record any documentary evidence to substantiate the fact that payment was made to deceased Kundalik and he has not produced vouchers about the cash payment. If really, deceased was supplying flowers to the above company, then it would have maintained documentary evidence to that effect. It would have also entered into an agreement with Kundalik to that effect and issued vouchers about the payment. It would have also maintained documentary evidence stating as to when, how and in what mode payment was made to Kundalik in lieu of supply of flowers to the above company. But, in absence of any sort of documentary evidence it is very hard to believe that deceased Kundalik was supplying flowers to the above company and getting Rs. 25,000/­ to Rs. 30,000/­ per month. 27]So also, even though initially P.W. 1 has denied that they are not dependent on their father. But, subsequently he has admitted that he and his brother are capable of earning, are married and having children. So also even though initially P.W. 2 has denied that sons of deceased are are not dependents on the deceased. But, subsequently he has admitted that sons of deceased are earning member. Judgment in M.A.C.P.No.598/2015 ­15­ 28]On perusal of the insurance policy filed on record vide Exh. 37, it appears that Scorpio bearing no. MH­12­GN­0100 was insured from 17.10.2014 to midnight of 16.10.2015. But the accident occurred on 26.09.2014 which does not include the date of accident. Therefore, in view of findings to Issue no. 1 and 2, the petitioners are not entitled to claim compensation from any of the opponents. Therefore, I answer Issue no. 3 in the negative and in result to answer Issue no. 4 pass the following order. O R D E R [1]The petition is dismissed. [2]Opponents shall bear their own costs. [3]Award be drawn accordingly. (V.R. Jagdal e) Date : 20.03.2020 Addl. Member, MACT, Pune. Judgment in M.A.C.P.No.598/2015 ­16­"

Claim for Rs.8,00,000/­ J U D G M E N T (Delivered on this 20 th Day of March 2020 ) 1­By way of this petition under section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act, applicants have claimed compensation in respect of death of Murlidhar Madhavrao Dhadave, in motor vehicular accident caused on 19.09.2014. 2­Facts of the applicants’ case are as under : The accident which gave rise to this petition took place on 19.09.2014 at about 11.20 hours on Pune­Satara Road, in front of hotel Panchami, Panchami Chowk, Pune. The deceased was riding scooty bearing No. MH­12­HP­ 3854. When he reached near spot of occurrence, offending S.T. bus bearing No. MH­14­DT­3491 came from opposite direction in high and excessive speed. It was being driven in a very rash and reckless manner. Due to high and excessive speed, the driver of S.T. bus could not control the S.T. Bus and gave dash to the scooty of deceased. Due to it, deceased sustained serious injuries and succumbed to them. 3­ After accident Police of Dattawadi Police Station registered an offence against driver of S.T. Bus under various sections of the Indian Penal Code as well as Motor Vehicles Act holding him responsible for causing accident. CNR No. 3 M.A.C.P. No. 730/2015 MHPU01­015138­2015 Judgment 4­It is further submitted that deceased was 69 years old retired from Pune Municipal Corporation, Pune and getting pension of Rs.16,000/­ per month. He was also earning Rs. 5,000/­ per month from agricultural business. Due to accident applicants sustained great mental shock. 5­The opponent was owner of S.T. Bus. An accident took place due to sole negligence of driver of offending S.T. Bus. It is, therefore, prayed that claim petition be allowed in terms of prayer clause. 6­Opponent filed its written statement at Exh. 9. All the averments in petition are denied in toto. The particulars like age, occupation and income of deceased are denied. It is specifically submitted that, there is no mistake of S.T. bus driver in the accident. So also, the deceased was not holding valid driving licence. It is therefore prayed that, claim be dismissed against Opponent . 7­Considering the rival submissions of both the parties, following issues were framed by my learned predecessor below Exh. 10. I have reproduced the same along with my findings thereon for the reasons given below. Sr. No.Issues Findings 1Whether the accident dated 19.04.2014 at about 11.20 hours on Pune Satara road, in front of hotel Panchami, Pune took placeIn the affirmative. CNR No. 4 M.A.C.P. No. 730/2015 MHPU01­015138­2015 Judgment due to rash and negligent driving of MSRTC bus bearing RTO registration No. MH­12­DT­3491 owned by the opponent, causing death of Murlidhar Madhavrao Dhadave ? 2Whether there is breach of fundamental terms and conditions of the policy ?Do not survive. 3Whether applicants are entitled to get compensation? If yes, to what extent and from whom ? Yes, Rs. 6,62,500 /­ From opponent 3What order ? As per final order. R E A S O N S As to Issue No.1 :­ 8­The applicant No.1, wife of the deceased examined herself as AW1 (Exh.16) in support of contentions in the claim petition. Apart from that, applicants also relied on various documents viz . F.I.R. Exh.17, Complainant Statement Exh. 18, spot panchanama Exh.19, Inquest Panchanama Exh. 20, Medical Cause of death Exh. 21, Form AA Exh. 22 and certified copies of pension papers Exh. 23/1, 23/2 and 23/3. The documents would be referred during the course of appreciation of evidence as and w hen required. 9­ AW 1 specifically deposed as to how accident took place. Admittedly, she is not an eye witness. The contents in application as well as evidence of AW1 are based on police papers. She deposed that, her husband, at the time of accident was riding scooty bearing No. MH­12­HP­3854. CNR No. 5 M.A.C.P. No. 730/2015 MHPU01­015138­2015 Judgment When he was taking right turn in the Panchami Square, the offending S.T. Bus bearing No. MH­14­DT­3391 dashed forcefully to the scooty. Due to it, deceased sustained severe head injury and succumbed to it. The contents of the police papers corroborates version of applicant. 10­It is tried to bring on record by the opponent that, accident took place in the B.R.T. reserved lane. It is also argued that, the lane was reserved only for the public transport buses. The deceased entered into such reserved lane and accident took place. Therefore, the opponent is not at all liable to pay any compensation. 11­It is settled principle of law that, the tribunal is not bound by strict rule of evidence. While appreciating evidence, the very purpose of beneficial legislature is required to be kept in mind. Technical approach to act as a fault finding machine defeating very purpose of beneficial legislature is not at all desirable. 12­The spot panchanama clearly shows that, spot of accident is Panchami Hotel Square. It is also specifically mentioned that, the spot of occurrence was in the middled of the square adjacent to B.R.T. reserved lane. Needless to say, the square is open for all the vehicles plying on the road. The B.R.T. reserved lane ends before starting of the square. As such defence raised by the opponent that, the accident took place in reserved lane and therefore they are not liable to CNR No. 6 M.A.C.P. No. 730/2015 MHPU01­015138­2015 Judgment pay any compensation, holds no base. The accident took place in the square due to rash and negligent driving of bus driver as he failed to take proper caution while coming out of reserved lane. 13­As far as death of victim is concerned, medical paper like inquest panchanama (Exh.20) and medical cause of death (Exh.21) shows cause of death as “Death due to head injury”. The deceased sustained multiple injuries along with head injury in the accident only. I, therefore, hold that, applicants prove that the accident dated 19.04.2014 at about 11.20 hours on Pune Satara road, in front of hotel Panchami, Pune took place due to rash and negligent driving of MSRTC bus bearing RTO registration No. MH­12­DT­3491 owned by the opponent, causing death of Murlidhar Madhavrao Dhadave. Hence I answer Issue No.1 in affirmative. As to Issue No. 2 :­ 14­The opponent being corporation, there is no question of insurance policy. As such this issue do not survive. As to Issue No. 3 : 15­The opponent, has not raised any other defence. The issue regarding negligence is already decided. As such what remains to be decided is just compensation. CNR No. 7 M.A.C.P. No. 730/2015 MHPU01­015138­2015 Judgment 16­While deciding compensation, it is necessary to determine income of the deceased first. The deceased was retired employee of Pune Municipal Corporation. He was 72 years old and getting pension of Rs.15,384/­(In the month of February/March 2014). Admittedly, after his death, the applicant being widow is entitled for family pension. She also accepted this fact during cross­examination. It has come on record that, she is getting family pension of Rs.8,000/­ per month. Thus, the loss is of Rs.7,384/­ per month. For the sake of computation of compensation, if his income is considered as Rs. 7,500/­, it shall meet the ends of justice. 17­As far as dependency of applicant No. 2 to 4 is concerned, in view of judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in 2020 CLU 317 National Insurance Co. Ltd. V/s Birender and Ors. the major and earning member of family can also claim compensation being legal representative as defined in clause (c) of Section 166(1) of the Motor Vehicle Act. 18­The deceased was 72 years old. He was looking after his family comprising his wife and three children. Thus 1/4th amount would be required to be deducted towards dependency. So also considering fixed income, 40 % amount is required to be added towards future prospects. Looking to age of deceased at the time of accident, multiplier of 5 would be applicable.

Opponent No. 2 is its insurer and opponent No. 3 is son of deceased. It is, therefore, prayed that, claim petition be allowed in terms of prayer clause. 5­Opponent Nos. 1 and 3 though duly served, remained absent. Hence application proceeded exparte against them. 6­The Opponent No. 2, Insurance Company has filed its written statement below Exh. 15. It is admitted that at the relevant time Dumper truck involved in the accident was duly insured with it. However, other particulars like age, income, occupation, dependency and negligence are specifically denied. It is also submitted that applicants has not made party to the owner and insurer of Scooty Pep. Hence application is bad for non joinder of necessary party. It is further submitted that, excessive and exorbitant claim is filed by applicants. With these contentions opponent No.2, prayed for dismissal of the claim against it. CNR No. 4 M.A.C.P. No. 503/2015 MHPU01­001286­2018 Judgment 7­Considering rival pleadings, following issues were framed by my learned predecessor below E xh. 19. I have reproduced the same along with my findings thereon for the reasons given below. Sr. No. Issues Findings 1Do the applicants prove that deceased Mrs. Hemlata Sudhakar Kasture died in the motor vehicular accident, caused on 09.03.2015 at about 12.00p.m. near Golf Club Chowk, Yerwada, Pune by rash and negligent driving of Dumper Truck bearing registration No. MH­12­ HD­5723 ?In the affirmative. 2Whether claim petition is bad for non joinder of necessary party ?In the negative. 3Whether applicants are entitled to compensation? If yes, (a) from whom and (b) to what amount ?Yes. from opponent Nos. 1 and 2 jointly and severally Rs.4,20,220/­ 4What order and Award ? As per final order. R E A S O N S Admitted facts 8­The involvement of Dumper Truck bearing registration No. MH­14­HD­5723 is admitted. The deceased sustained multiple injuries in accident and died in the hospital. An offence is registered only against driver of Dumper Truck. CNR No. 5 M.A.C.P. No. 503/2015 MHPU01­001286­2018 Judgment As to Issue No.1:­ 9­In support of contentions, applicant No. 1 examined himself at Exh. 23. Along with oral testimony, applicant also relied upon documentary evidence like complainant statement Exh. 28, F.I.R. Exh. 29, Spot Panchanama Exh. 30, Inquest panchanama Exh. 31, Cause of death certificate Exh. 32 and Form AA Exh. 33. The relevant documentary evidence would be appreciated as and when required during the course of discussion. 10­Applicant, AW­1 specifically deposed as to how accident took place. Admittedly he is not an eye witness. His evidence is based on police papers. It has come on record that, on the fateful day, the deceased was proceeding from Sancheti Hospital towards Yerwada on her Scooty Pep bearing registration No. MH­12­CE­2797. When she reached near spot of occurrence, Dumper truck which came from behind dashed to the Scooty of deceased and she succumbed to the injuries sustained in the accident. The evidence of applicant is fully corroborated by the contents of police papers. In the cross­examination also nothing is brought on record to disbelieve testimony of applicant. Nonetheless, the police after investigation found driver of Dumper Truck negligent, and therefore registered an offence against him. The evidence and documents on record thus clearly shows that accident took place due to rash and negligent act of CNR No. 6 M.A.C.P. No. 503/2015 MHPU01­001286­2018 Judgment driver of Dumper Truck only. 11­Moving further, t he Inquest panchanama (Exh. 31) and cause of death certificate (Exh. 32) show that death occurred due to multiple injuries. Those injuries were caused due to accident only. The evidence on the record also clearly establish that due to rash and negligent act of the driver of Dumper Truck, accident took place. As a result of it, Hemlata Sudhakar Kasture died during treatment in hospital. I, therefore, hold that applicants prove that, deceased Mrs. Hemlata Sudhakar Kasture died in the motor vehicular accident, caused on 09.03.2015 at about 12.00p.m. near Golf Club Chowk, Yerwada, Pune by rash and negligent driving of Dumper Truck bearing registration No. MH­12­ HD­5723. Hence I answer Issue No.1 in the affirmative. As to issue No. 2 : 12­As far as question of non joinder of necessary party is concerned, it is necessary to mention here that, this plea is raised by opponent only in written statement. No any evidence is adduced by opponent to substantiate aforesaid plea. In any case, it is always choice of applicants to decide their opponent. Only because insurance company of Scooty Pep is not added as party, it cannot be held that entire petition is bad for non joinder of necessary party. I therefore, answer issue No. 2 in the negative. CNR No. 7 M.A.C.P. No. 503/2015 MHPU01­001286­2018 Judgment As to Issue No. 3 :­ 13­As far as objections raised by Insurance company are concerned, they are two fold. (a) Applicants are major and earning members (b) Family pension would be received by the husband of deceased. It is argued by Advocate for Insurance company that applicants being major and earning members cannot be termed as dependents of the deceased. Therefore, they are not entitled for any compensation. Needless to say it is not settled law that, the earning and major applicants can also claim compensation. The applicants also relied upon following case laws. (i)A. Maddaiah and others V/s Vishwanath and another reported in 2014 ACJ 701 of Hon'ble High Court of Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad. (ii)National Insurance Company Limited V/s Birender and Ors reported in Civil Appeal Nos. 242­243 of 2020 of Hon'ble Supreme Court of India . From the case laws cited supra, it is crystal clear that, major and earning members of family can apply for compensation for the death of one of the family members. As far as second objection is concerned, Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case law of National Insurance Company Limited V/s Birender and Ors (supra) specifically held that, family pension cannot be deducted while CNR No. 8 M.A.C.P. No. 503/2015 MHPU01­001286­2018 Judgment computing just and fair compensation. As such both the objections raised by the Insurance company hold no base. 14­As far as just and fair compensation is concerned, the applicants could only prove pension of the deceased. From perusal of the account extract of the deceased, it can be seen that, her pension was being deposited in her account regularly. The last pension was Rs.8,500/­. As there is no evidence regarding tuitions allegedly taken by the deceased, the amount claimed regarding it cannot be considered. 15­Admittedly, the deceased was 75 years old lady. She was looking after her family. As there are three dependents, deduction would be 1/3rd. The multiplier which would be applicable is 5. 16­Apart from it, AW 1 specifically deposed that, soon after accident the deceased was admitted in hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, during treatment she died. The bill of hospitalisation is Rs.10,175/­i.e. Rs.10,200/­ (rounded up). Though the bills on record are not exhibited, it is required to keep in mind that they are original bills. So also the amount claimed is not excessive or exorbitant. As such the applicants are entitled for aforesaid amount towards compensation. 17­The tabular form of computation would be as follows : CNR No. 9 M.A.C.P.

As far as rate of interest is concern, looking to the prevailing rate of interest of banks, applicants would be entitled for interest @ 9% per annum from the date of petition till actual realization of award of compensation. Who Shall pay : 19­The Insurance company examined DW1. Sachin Indrachand Gunjal (Exh.45) of RTO, Pune. He has specifically CNR No. 10 M.A.C.P. No. 503/2015 MHPU01­001286­2018 Judgment deposed that, on the day of accident, the driver was not allowed to drive vehicle. However, it has also came on record that, on the day of accident, the licence of driver was valid only if grace period is consider. The driver was having valid licence since 2007. It was being renewed time to time. As such it cannot be said that, non having licence renewed was the major cause of accident. However, it cannot also be kept out of mind that, the driver was duty bound to get his licence renewed in time. As such in presence circumstances, it is fit case for passing 'pay and recover 'order. 20­As opponent No. 1 is the owner of Dumper truck and opponent No. 2 is its insurer, both the opponents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation at the rate of 9% per annum with liberty to opponent No. 2 to pay initially and recover the same from opponent No.1. Hence, issue No. 3 is answered accordingly. 21­In sequel I pass following order. O R D E R 1­Claim Petition is allowed with costs. 2­The Opponent Nos. 1 and 2 shall jointly and severally pay compensation of Rs.4,20,220 /­(Rs.

Bathia, Advocate for opponent No.4 ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­ Claim Rs.1,50,000,00/­ Judgment (Delivered on­04/10/2016) Applicants have filed the present application , for seeking compensation under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, in respect of death of Ram Arjundas Bijlani (Hereinafter referred as ''the deceased­Ram''), in motor vehicular accident, occurred on 31/10/2007 within the jurisdiction of Manchar Police Station. 2.The facts of the applicants' case are as under­ Petitioners are widow (Smt. Sangita) and two major son and daughter of Late Ram Bijlani, deceased­victim. At the time of accident, deceased­Ram was around 59 years. Fatal accident was on 31/10/2007. Deceased­Ram was working as a Vice President (Operations) in ADOR Wielding Limited, Akurdi. He was permanent employee. His monthly salary was Rs.1,20,306/­. He had future prospects. Applicants were his dependents. 3.On fateful day, deceased­Ram was occupant along with other persons in Honda City Car bearing registration No.MH/12/DY/5385 (hereinafter referred as '' the car''). He was proceeding from Narayangaon side to Pune side. Car was being driven by Sachin Mujumdar. Car was in a moderate speed. Car reached to the place of occurrence situated near Nandkumar Petrol Pump, on Pune­ Nashik road, village Manchar. At that time, Scorpio Jeep bearing registration No. MH/04/Z/129 (hereinafter referred as '' the 3 MACP No.77/2015 offending jeep'') came from opposite side and gave violent dash to the car. Due to the said dash, deceased ­Ram had sustained severe injuries and succumbed to death. It is stated that the offending jeep was in a high speed. Yogesh Narayan Agarwal was driving the offending jeep. Offending jeep was in a high and excessive speed. Therefore, offending jeep driver could not control over the jeep and all of sudden, offending jeep came to wrong side and dashed the car. It is stated that offending jeep driver was only responsible for the accident and accordingly Police P. S. Manchar registered Crime no.97/2007 under section 279, 337, 338, 304­A of the Indian Penal Code and under section 184 of the Motor Vehicles Act. Police investigated the crime and filed charge sheet against the offending jeep driver. 4.Opponent No.1 was registered owner of offending jeep and Jeep was insured with opponent No.2­ Chola Mandalam MS General Insurance Company (hereinafter referred as ''opponent No.2''). Opponent No.3 was driver and also was registered owner of the car and said car was insured with opponent No.4­ United Insurance Co. Limited. (hereinafter referred as '' opponent No.4''). Therefore, it is submitted that the opponents are liable to pay jointly and severally the compensation of Rs. 1,50,00,000/­. With this, it is requested to allow the application with interest @ 15% per annum from the date of application till realization of entire amount. 5.Opponent No.1 though appeared through advocate but failed to file his written statement. Therefore, claim application proceeded without written statement against him. 6.Opponent No.2 filed its written statement below Exh.16. It has been admitted that opponent No.1 is registered owner of 4 MACP No.77/2015 offending jeep and the offending jeep was insured with it. Registration of Crime No.97/2007 by P. S. Manchar against the offending jeep is also not under dispute. However, it is the contention of opponent No.2 that at the relevant time of the accident, offending jeep driver was not driving the offending jeep so rashly and negligently endanger to human life. It is further contented that the offending jeep driver was driving the offending jeep in a moderate speed and by following traffic rules. According to opponent No.2, car driver i.e. opponent No.3 was negligent at the relevant time and because of his fault, accident occurred. In addition to this, it is also contention of opponent No.2 that the offending jeep driver was not holding valid and effective driving license to driver the jeep. Opponent No.1 handed over the offending jeep to the driver knowing that the driver was not holding valid driving license. Age, income and occupation of deceased­Ram have been denied. It is denied that deceased­Ram had future prospects. With this, it is requested that application may be dismissed. 7.Opponent No.3 filed his written statement below Exh.23 and written statement of opponent No.4 is at Exh.19. Some and substance of defence of opponent Nos. 3 and 4 is that opponent Nos. 3 was registered owner of the car and car was insured with opponent No.4. Registration of crime No. by P. S.Manchar against the offending jeep is admitted. According to opponent Nos. 3 and 4, at the relevant time of accident, opponent No.3 was driving the car and proceeding towards Pune. Car was in a moderate speed. He was observing all traffic rules and regulations. They submitted that car reached to the place of occurrence and at that time, offending jeep came from opposite direction. Offending jeep was a high and excessive speed. Therefore, its driver could not control over it and dashed on the car. 5 MACP No.77/2015 It is repeatedly stated that offending jeep driver was only responsible for the accident. However, age, income and occupation of deceased­ Ram have been denied. Lastly, it is requested to dismiss the claim application. 8.On the rival contentions of the parties, Issues are framed at Exh.27. Those are reproduced below with my findings against each of them, for the reasons to follows­ Sr. No.Issues Findings 1 Do the applicants prove that deceased­Ram Arjundas Bijlani died in the motor vehicular accident, caused on 31/10/2007 at about 06 p.m., village Manchar, near one Nandkumar Petrolpump on Nashik road, Manchar due to composite negligence of both the drivers of vehicle No.MH/12/DY/5385 and vehicle MH/04/Z/129 ?Offending jeep driver was negligent to the extent of 80% whereas, the car driver was negligent to the extent of 20%. 2 Whether applicants are entitled to compensation, if yes, a) from whom and b) to what amount?As per final order 3 What oder and Award? As per final order R E A S O N S 9. In order to prove their claim application, the applicants have examined applicant No.1­ Sangita Ram Bijlani below Exh. 29 as AW­1, Radhakrushnan Gopinathan Pille below Exh.30 as AW­2 and closed the evidence vide exh.45. Opponent Nos. 2 and 4 did not enter witness box and closed their respective evidence vide Pursis Exh.46 and 47. Opponent No.3 did not turn to the court, therefore, this court closed his evidence by passing order below Exh.1 dated 31/08/2016. 6 MACP No.77/2015 Apart from oral evidence, applicants have relied on the police papers of Crime No.97/2007 of Police station Manchar such as Charge sheet (Exh.30), Spot panchanama (Exh.31), Inquest panchanama (Exh.32), Postmortem report (Exh.33), Form Comp AA (Exh.34), Form No.16 (Exh.40), Pay Slip for the month of October 2007 (Exh.42). 10.Admitted facts of the case:­ Applicants are the legal heirs of deceased­Ram. Ram Bijlani died in a vehicular accident dated 31/10/2007 at 6 p.m.. Police P. S.Manchar took the cognizance of the accident and registered Crime no.97/2007 against the offending jeep driver namely Yogesh Ramnarayan Agrawal. It is also admitted that offending jeep and the car were involved in the accident. Opponent No.1 was registered owner of offending jeep and the said jeep was insured with opponent No.2. Opponent No.3 was driving the car. Opponent No.3 was registered owner of the car and the car was insured with opponent No.4. 11.As to Issue No. 1:­ AW­1 Sangita is widow of deceased­ Ram. Her evidence is inconsonance to the pleading. She deposed that one the date of accident, her husband, one Raghuvisingh Kanda were occupant in the car. Sachin Mujumdar was driving the said car. Car was in a moderate speed. They were proceeding in Pune direction. They reached to the place of occurrence. At that time, offending jeep came from opposite direction in a high and excessive speed and all of sudden came to wrong side and dashed to the car. She repeatedly stated that the offending jeep driver was at fault. She was cross­ examined and during course of cross­examination, she admitted that accident took place due to fault of both the vehicles' driver. Admittedly, AW­1 Sangita is not an eye witness to the accident. Her 7 MACP No.77/2015 evidence is based on police papers. Therefore, it would be proper for me to assess the rash and negligent driving of vehicles' driver on the basis of police papers of Crime No. 97/2007 of police station Manchar. Question is whether, the rash and negligent driving of the vehicles driver can be assessed on the basis of police papers or not. According to me, the provisions of Evidence Act are not strictly applicable to the proceeding under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act. Therefore, I am of the view that the police papers can be read in the evidence and the negligent driving can be assessed. On this point, I am relying on the Judgment of Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of Oriental Insurance Co.Ltd. Vs. Babulal Chunilal Somani (2015(1) MH. L. J. 71), in which, it is held that '' in the absence of any direct evidence regarding manner and details of accident, reliance can be placed on contents of certified copy of FIR and panchanama spot of occurrence.'' Here in this case, the applicants have filed police papers including charge sheet of Crime No.97/2007 of police Station, Manchar. I have gone through the police papers very minutely. It reveals from the accident that offending jeep driver was driving the said jeep so rashly and negligently. Offending jeep was in a high and excessive speed. Therefore, he could not control over it and the accident occurred. At the same time, it reveals that an opportunity was available with the car driver i.e. opponent No.3 to avoid the accident to take the car aside to give a side to offending jeep. But he did nothing and thereby he failed in his duties. Therefore, I am of the view that the both the vehicles' drivers were negligent at the relevant time of accident. Considering facts and circumstances of the case, I am also of the view that offending jeep driver was negligent to the extent of 80%. Whereas, the car driver was negligent to the extent of 8 MACP No.77/2015 20%. It is pertinent that the contributory negligence of both the vehicles' driver has also been especially admitted by the Insurance company in Sister MACP No.653/2008, which was compromised before Lokadalat dated 30/11/2011. Copy of compromise of MACP No.653/2008 is filed below Exh.48. Therefore, I have no hesitation to hold that the both the vehicles' driver were negligent at the relevant time of accident. I, therefore, passed my answer to Issue No.1 accordingly. 12.As to Issue Nos. 2 and 3 :­ It has been argued on behalf of opponent No.2 that driver of offending jeep was not holding valid and effective driving license and therefore, opponent No.2 may be exonerated from the liability to pay the compensation. It is pertinent that the opponent No.2 neither filed copy of alleged driving license of offending jeep driver nor examined any witness. There is also no evidence that the offending jeep owner had knowledge that his driver was not holding the effective driving license and even then handed over the offending jeep to the driver. Therefore, the argument of advocate Smt. Wagdarikar for opponent No.2 does not inspire my confidence. 13.Compensation under section166 of the Motor Vehicles Act is based on age, income of occupant of deceased. Here in this case, applicants have come with the case that deceased­Ram was 59 years of age at the time of accident. Evidence of AW­1 is also in the same line. Age of deceased­Ram has not been challenged during course of cross­ examination. There is absolutely no suggestion that the deceased­Ram was not the age of 59 years on the date of accident. In this circumstances, I have no reason to disbelieve the unchallenged evidence of AW­1 on this point. Accordingly, I hold that deceased­ 9 MACP No.77/2015 Ram was 59 years old on the date of accident. Therefore, multiplier applicable to the age group of 56 to 60 years is 09. 14.So far as income of deceased­Ram is concerned, it has come in the evidence of AW­1 that deceased­Ram was working as Vice President (Operations in ADOR) Welding Limited, Akurdi, Pune. His monthly salary was Rs. 1,65,675/­. Evidence of AW­1 on the point of income is contrary to the pleading. According to the claim application, the monthly income of deceased­Ram was Rs, 1,20,306/­. Therefore, evidence without pleading cannot be accepted. In order to prove the income of deceased­Ram, applicants have examined AW­2 Radha Krushnan Pille , Administrative Head of ADOR of Welding Limited, Akurdi. He deposed that deceased­ Ram was permanent employee of the company and joined the company on 01/03/1972. He deposed that Gross salary of deceased for the month of October 2007 was Rs. 1,16,100/­. He filed Form No.16 of deceased below Exh.40 and Salary certificate of deceased for the month of October 2007 below Exh.42. In view of his evidence, I have gone through with Form No.16 for the assessment year 2008­2009. On going through the same, it has come to my notice that income of deceased is calculated from 01/04/2007 to 31/10/2007 i.e. for 7 month only. It is further notice to me that medical reimbursement, Leave encashment and Gratuity are also calculated as income of deceased­Ram. Not only this, income of deceased is calculated for 7 month. Whereas income tax is deducted for 9 month. Therefore, I am not satisfied with the Form No.16. Form No.16 therefore,cannot be treated as base as income of deceased­Ram. In this circumstances, I have to rely on Pay slip of deceased­Ram for the month of October 2007 (Exh.42). On going through the same, it is noticed to me that the gross salary of deceased for the month of 10 MACP No.77/2015 October 2007 was Rs. 1,20,305/­. Income tax of Rs. 29,029/­ and Professional tax of Rs. 200/­ is required to be deducted to come to monthly net salary. After deductions, monthly net salary of the deceased­ Ram comes to Rs. 91,076/­ and yearly income of deceased­ Ram comes to Rs. 10,92,912/­. I have already observed that he was permanent employee. Therefore, in view of Judgment in the case of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Rajesh and others Vs. Rajbir Singh and others ( 2013 ACJ 1403), 15 % future proposes is required to be added in yearly income of Rs.10,92,915/­. As such, after adding 15% future prospects in Rs.10,92,915/­, total yearly income comes to Rs.12,56,852/­. 15.It is the contention of applicants that applicant Nos. 1 to 3 were dependent on the income of deceased. Admittedly, AW­1 is widow, applicant No.2 is son and opponent No.3 is married daughter of deceased­Ram. Applicant Nos. 2 and 3 both are major. Applicant No.2 is shown as businessman and applicant No.3 is in service. Applicant Nos. 2 and 3 both are independent. They both have their own source of income. Therefore, I am of the view that the applicant No.1 being the widow was only dependent on the income of deceased. Accordingly, she is only entitled to compensation. Considering only one dependent, ½ amount is required to be deducted towards living and personal expenses of deceased­Ram from Rs.12,56,852/­. After deducting ½ amount towards living and personal expenses of the deceased, yearly dependency of applicants on the income of deceased comes to Rs.6,28,426/­. By applying multiplier 09 to the yearly dependency of Rs.6,28,426/­, total loss of dependency of the applicants, on the income of deceased comes to Rs.56,55,834/­ In addition to this, applicant No.1 being widow is entitled to get 11 MACP No.77/2015 compensation of Rs.1,00,000/­ towards Loss of Consortium in view of directions given by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Rajesh and others Vs. Rajbir Singh and others ( 2013 ACJ 1403). Applicant No.1 is also entitled to get Rs.25,000/­ towards Funeral Expenses and Rs.1,00,000/­ towards loss of Love and Affection. As such, applicant No.1 is entitled to total compensation of Rs.58,80,834/­ rounded upto Rs. 58,80,850/­ along with interest @ of 9% per annum (inclusive of interim compensation awarded under section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act).

Mayur Nandu Gaikwad, the son of the Claimants died in the motor vehicular accident. Hence, the Claimants have filed this Petition for compensation of Rs. 25,00,000/­ ( Rs. Twenty five lakhs only). 2 MACP No. 123/2015 Brief facts of the Claimants' case are as under :­ 2]That on 20/12/2014 at about 8:00 am Mayur was driving his Maruti car No. MH­14­AE­3161 and his friend was accompanying to him. When they reached near milestone No. 12, Sarvatranaga at Dehuroad on Mumbai­Pune old highway. At that time, one bus bearing No. MH­43­H­0669 came from opposite side in a very high and excessive speed and dashed against the car being driven by Mayur. Due to the dash Mayur sustained grievous injuries leading to his death before treatment. In the accident, his friend also sustained injuries and his car was extensively damaged. According to the Claimants, at the time of the accident, driver of the above numbered bus drove the bus in rash and negligent manner, consequently, the accident took place. 3] According to the Claimants, they are not eye­witnesses to the incident. From the copy of FIR and spot panchanama it is seen that the above numbered bus was being driven in a high speed. The driver lost his control over the bus and went on the wrong side and dashed against the car of the deceased. The facts and circumstances of the case clearly attract the principle of "" Res Ipsa Loquitor "". 4]It is stated that at the time of the accident, Opponent No. 1 was the registered owner of the offending bus and the driver of the bus was driving the same during the course of his employment, with and / or within the knowledge / permission of Opponent No. 1. Hence, Opponent No. 1 would be vicariously liable. At the time of the accident, the offending bus was validly insured with Opponent No. 2, Insurance Company. Hence, Opponent No. 1 and Opponent No. 2 , are jointly and severally responsible to pay compensation to the Claimants. 5]At the time of the accident, deceased was 20 years old. He was the only child of the Claimants. He was working as a Desktop 3 MACP No. 123/2015 Supportable Engineer in Sugat Tech­com Pvt. Ltd. and earning Rs. 18,000/­ per month. The Claimants have lost their only hope for the rest of the life. The car of the deceased was extensively damaged. It was beyond repairs, hence, sold as scrap for Rs. 9000/­. The Claimants have filed this Petition for compensation of Rs. 25,00,000/­ in lumsum under all permissible Heads with future interest @ 15% per annum. 6]Opponent No. 1 was duly served with the notice, but failed to appear in the matter. Hence, the matter is proceeded exparte against him. 7]Opponent no. 2, the Insurance Company filed its Written Statement (Exh. 10). It is admitted that at the relevant date and time the offending bus bearing No. MH­43­H­0669 was validly insured with their Insurance Company. Opponent No. 2 denied the age, occupation and income of the deceased. According to it, the alleged accident was not a result of any negligence on the part of the bus driver. Therefore, it challenges that the Claimants must strictly prove the occurrence of the accident in the manner narrated by them in the Petition. It also denies the losses suffered by the Claimants. Lastly, Opponent No. 2 prayed for dismissal for the Claim Petition. 8]I have framed following issues at Exh. 14 and recorded my findings thereon for the reasons stated below :­ SR. NO.ISSUES FINDINGS 1Whether due to rash and negligent driving of the bus bearing No. MH­43­H­0669 an accident occurred and as a consequence thereof Shri. Mayur Nandu Gaikwad died?Yes. 4 MACP No. 123/2015 2Whether the Claimants are entitled to get compensation ? If yes, what should be the quantum ?Yes. Compensation of Rs. 9,45,000/­ (Rs. Nine Lakhs and Forty­four thousand only) 3Who is liable to pay compensation ? Opponent Nos. 1 and 2 are jointly and severally. 4What order ? Application is allowed. R E A S O N S AS TO ISSUE NO. 1 :­ 9]Nandu Gaikwad (CW1)(Exh.15), the father of deceased Mayur states that on 20/12/2014 at about 8:00 am Mayur was driving his Maruti car No. MH­14­AE­3161. When he reached near milestone No. 12, Sarvatranaga at Dehuroad on Mumbai­Pune old highway, at that time, one bus bearing No. MH­43­H­0669 came from opposite side in a very high and excessive speed and dashed against the car being driven by Mayur. Due to the dash Mayur sustained grievous injuries leading to his death before treatment. In the accident, his friend also sustained injuries and his car was extensively damaged. According to the Claimants, at the time of the accident, driver of the above numbered bus drove the bus in rash and negligent manner, consequently, the accident took place. 10] He further states that he is not eye­witness to the incident. From the copy of FIR and spot panchanama it is seen that the above numbered bus was being driven in a high speed. The driver lost his control over the bus and went on the wrong side heating the car coming from opposite side violently. 11]It appears that the matter was reported to Dehuroad Police 5 MACP No. 123/2015 Station. Offence came to be registered vide C.R. No. 279/2014 under Section 304(A), 337, 338, of IPC and 184 of the Motor Vehicle Act. FIR / statement of the informant (Exh. 17 ) is produced on the record. The Police Officer drew the spot Panchanama (Exh.18). Thereafter, dead body of Mayur sent for Post Mortem to Pimpri­Chinchwad Municipal Hospital.The Claimants have produced on record the Post Mortem report (Exh.20). 12]On perusal of oral evidence of Nandu (CW1) and documentary evidence such as a copy of F.I.R. / statement of the informant (Exh.17), spot panchanama (Exh.18), Post Mortem Report (Exh. 20), it appears that the same are consistent to each other. Nandu (CW1) has been cross­examined on behalf of Opponent No. 2. However, nothing significant has come on the record in favour of Opponent No. 2 from the said cross­examination. Considering the spot panchanama (Exh. 18), it appears that the road where accident took place is wide enough. However, only because of rash and negligent driving of the offending bus by its driver, the accident took place. I, therefore, hold that the Claimants have proved that on 20/12/2014 at about 8:00 am the said accident occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the bus bearing registration No. MH­43­H­0669 by which death of Mayur Nandu Gaikwad was caused. I, therefore, answer issue No.1 in the affirmative. 13]AS TO ISSUE NO. 2 AND 3 It is not in dispute that at the time of the accident, the bus driver was driving the bus under the employment and knowledge of Opponent No. 1 who was the registered owner of the offending bus . At the time of the accident, the offending bus was validly insured with Opponent No. 2, Insurance Company. Hence, Opponent No. 1 and Opponent No. 2, are jointly and severally responsible to pay compensation to the Claimants. 6 MACP No. 123/2015 14]Now, the question remains in respect of quantum of compensation to be given to the Claimants. Nandu (CW1) states athat at the time of the accident, deceased Mayur was 20 years old. In column 2 of the Petition date of birth of deceased Mayur is mentioned as 23/05/1994. Though the Claimants have not produced any positive evidence regarding birth date of deceased Mayur, the said date of birth is not challenged by the Opponent. I, therefore, have no hesitation to hold that at the time of the accident deceased Mayur was 20 years old. 15] Nandu (CW1) states that at the time of the accident Mayur was working as a Desktop Supportable Engineer in Sugat Tech­com Pvt. Ltd. and was earning Rs. 18,000/­ per month. The Claimants have lost their only hope for the rest of the life. The car of the deceased was extensively damaged. It was beyond repairs, hence, sold as scrap for Rs. 9000/­. The Claimants have filed this Petition for compensation of Rs. 25,00,000/­ in lumsum under all permissible Heads with future interest @ 15% per annum. 16]To prove income of the deceased, Claimants have examined Vikas Baban Ovhal (CW2)(Exh.25), the Managing Director of Sugat Tech­com Pvt. Ltd. Co. He states that deceased Mayur was serving in their company in October, 2014 as Desktop Support Engineer and was earning Rs. 18,000/­ per month as salary. He has produced salary certificate (Exh.26). Opponent No. 2 challenged and denied that the deceased was earning Rs. 18000/­ per month. Vikas (CW2) was cross­ examined by Opponent No. 2. He admits that he has not brought any document to show that the said company is in existence. He has not brought appointment letter of deceased Mayur Gaikwad and cash vouchers which were prepared for payment of salary to deceased Mayur. 7 MACP No. 123/2015 17]From the evidence adduced by the Claimants on the point of income of deceased Mayur, I am of the opinion that the said evidence is not sufficient and cogent. If deceased Mayur was appointed and working with the said Sugat Tech­com Co. Ltd., Vikas Ovhal (CW2), the Managing Director would have produced requisite documentary evidence to show existence of his company, appointment of deceased Mayur and payment of salary to deceased Mayur. Even, the Claimants had an opportunity to produce such important documents on the record to substantiate their claim of income of deceased Mayur. The Claimants have also not produced documentary evidence to show educational qualification of deceased Mayur to place reliance that he was working as Desktop Support Engineer. On the basis of evidence adduced by the Claimants, I declined to hold that the deceased was earning Rs. 18,000/­ per month as stated by the Claimants. 18]However, considering the age of the deceased I am of the opinion that an able bodied person like deceased Mayur can earn at Rs. 200/­ per day. Hence, in my opinion, his notional monthly income can be assessed to Rs. 6000/­ per month. I, therefore, hold that at the time of the death the deceased was earning Rs. 6000/­ per month. 19]Ld. Advocate for the Claimants submitted that future prospects of income should also be considered in respect of death of a person who was in private services or self­employed. It is not only applicable to the Government Servant or Permanent Employee. In support of his arguments, he relied upon the case law ­ Munnalal Jain and another Vs. Vipin Kumar Sharma and others, (2015) 6 SCC 347 wherein Their Lordships held that in the matter of fatal accident compensation while determining just compensation future prospects of self­employed persons is required to be added. If deceased victim is 8 MACP No. 123/2015 below 40 years, there must be addition of 50% to actual income of deceased while computing future prospects. 20]In the light of observations made by Their Lordships as above and considering notional income of the deceased and his age, deceased being 20 years old there must be addition of 50% to his income. I, therefore, assess monthly income of the deceased to Rs. 9000/­ (Rs. 6000/­ + Rs. 3000/­). Hence, his annual income can be assessed to the tune of Rs. 1,08,000/­ (Rs. One lakh and eight thousand only). 21]Ld. Advocate for Opponent No. 2 submitted that in the matter of young and unmarried victim of fatal accident, at the time of applying multiplier for calculation of loss of future income age of the parents of the deceased must be taken into consideration. In support of his arguments, he relied upon the case law ­ (1) 1996 ACJ 831(SC), (2) 2007 ACJ 2816 (SC) and (3) 2008 ACJ 814 (SC). In these case laws it is mainly observed by Their Lordships that selection of multiplier cannot in all cases be solely dependent on the age of the deceased. Age of parents is also relavant for the death of a bachelor. 22]Considering the above mentioned case laws and the fact that deceased Mayur was unmarried, I am of the opinion that while selecting a multiplier in this case, age of the parents of deceased must be taken into consideration. It is also well settled that for selecting multiplier age of youngest parents must be taken into consideration. Claimant No. 1 is the father and Claimant No. 2 is the mother of deceased Mayur. In the Petition age of Claimant No. 1 is shown as 45 years while age of Claimant No. 2 is shown as 40 years. As per Sarla Verma's case [ AIR 2009 SC 3104 (1)] for the age group of 45 to 41 9 MACP No. 123/2015 years multiplier is '14' while for the age group of 40 to 36 years multiplier of '15' is applicable. As mentioned above, age of youngest Claimant i.e. Claimant No. 2 is 40 years, hence, in my opinion, in this case multiplier of '15' is applicable. 23]As mentioned above, the annual income of the deceased would be Rs. 1,08,000/­. A ge of youngest Claimant i.e. Claimant No. 2 is 40 years, hence, in my opinion, in this case multiplier of '15' is applicable. If annual income of Rs.1,08,000/­ is multiplied by 15 it would come to Rs. 16,20,000/­ (Rs. Sixteen lakhs and Twenty thousand only). The deceased was unmarried. Hence, as per the guidelines laid down in the matter of Sarla Verma (Supra) 50% deduction towards personal expenses which would have incurred towards maintaining himself had he been alive. Hence, 50% amount comes to Rs. 8,10,000/­ (Rs. Eight lakhs and ten thousand only). As settled position of law the Claimants are also entitled for compensation of Rs. 1,00,000/­ (Rs. One lakh only) on account of loss of love and affection, Rs. 10,000/­ for loss of estate and Rs.25,000/­ (Rs. Twenty­five thousand only) towards funeral expenses. All these calculations can be made as follows – Sr. No.Particulars Amount 1Loss of dependency Rs. 8,10,000 2Loss of love and affection Rs. 1,00,000 3Loss of estate Rs. 10,000 4Funeral expenses Rs. 25,000 ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­ Total amount of compensation Rs. 9,45,000 Thus, total amount of Rs. 9,45,000/­ (Rs. Nine lakhs and Forty­five thousand only) can be awarded to the Claimants as compensation. 10 MACP No. 123/2015 24]As mentioned above,the Claimants are entitled to get compensation of Rs. 9,45,000/­ (Rs. Nine lakhs and Forty­five thousand only). In my opinion, they are also entitled to get future interest @ 9% per annum. It is already held that Opponent No. 1 being the registered owner of the offending bus bearing No. MH­43­H­0669 and Opponent No. 2 being insurer of the offending bus are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the Claimants. I, therefore, answer issue No. 3 accordingly. AS TO ISSUE NO.4:­ 25]The Claimants are the parents of the deceased and they are almost of same age group. Hence, in my opinion, it would be just and proper to distribute the amount of compensation to the Claimants equally. 26]In order to safeguard the future interest of the Claimants and considering their age, I think it fit to direct investment of Rs. 3,00,000/­ (Rs. Three lakhs only) each in the names of Claimants in Fixed Deposit for a period of three years in any Nationalized Bank of their choice with liberty to withdraw the amount of interest accrued thereon, quarterly, if desired. Remaining amounts of compensations payable to Claimants be paid to them by Account Payee cheques. In the result, in answer to issue No.4, I pass the following order ­­­ O R D E R 1.The claimants are entitled to get Rs. 9,45,000/­ (Rs. Nine lakhs and Forty­five thousand only) towards compensation. 2.Opponent Nos. 1 and 2 do pay Rs. Rs. 9,45,000/­ (Rs. Nine lakhs and Forty­five thousand only) jointly and severally to the claimants with interest @ 9% p.a. from the date of institution of the Petition till its realization. 3.The Opponents shall deposit an amount of compensation alongwith interest as above in the Tribunal. 11 MACP No. 123/2015 4.After depositing amount of compensation as above, an amount of Rs. 3,00,000/­ (Rs. Three lakhs only) each be invested in the names of Claimants in Fixed Deposit for a period of three years in any Nationalized Bank of their choice with liberty to withdraw the amount of interest accrued thereon, quarterly, if desired.. 5.Remaining amount of compensation including interest thereon be paid to the Claimants equally by Account Payee cheque. 6.Opponent Nos. 1 and 2 jointly and severally shall pay costs of the Petition to the Claimants and shall bear their own.

OPPONENTS CLAIM PETITION U/SEC.166 OF THE MOTOR VEHICLES ACT FOR GRANT OF COMPENSATION OF Rs.10,000,00/ ­ Appearances : ­ Mr,B.S.Pujari, advocate for the applicants opponent No.1 is exparte Shri.S.A.Maheshwari , advocate for Opponent No.2 Judgment in MACP No.341/2015 -2- J U D G M E N T ( Delivered on 8th August, 2016 ) In this claim petition U/Sec.166 of Motor Vehicles Act, applicant has claimed compensation of Rs.10 lac, for the death of Sham Devendra Pardeshi in the motor accident. 02.Case of the applicants, in short, is as under : That, on 7­09­2014 at about 22.45 hrs. the deceased Sham Devendra Pardeshi was proceeding towards Talegaon on motor­cycle bearing registration No.MH­14­DE­ 8367 as a pillion rider. When the said motor­cycle reached at Swamy Chowk, Dehuroad, that time truck bearing registration No.KA­56­0053, coming from rear side, being driven by the driver of opponent No.1, dashed the said motor­cycle of the deceased. The truck was being driven in rash and negligent manner. Opponent No.1 is the owner and opponent No.2 is the Insurer of the said truck. D eceased Sham sustained injuries and died in the hospital. Deceased Sham was doing work of tattoo and was earning Rs.15,000/­ per month. The age of the deceased at the time of accident was 20 years. Applicant has claimed Rs.10,000,00/­ under all the permissible heads of compensation. Applicant is mother of the deceased and only dependent and legal heir of deceased Sham. 03.Opponent No.1 was duly served with notice vide Ex.11 but he did not appear in the case. Hence, case Judgment in MACP No.341/2015 -3- proceeded Ex­parte against him. 04.Opponent No.2, the Insurer of the truck filed its written statement at Ex.13 and submitted as under : Defence of the Insurance Company was of total denial. It is denied that the deceased was 20 years old and earning Rs.15,000/­ per month. It is admitted that the offending truck involved in the accident was insured with it. It is denied that the incidence took place due to the negligence of the driver of the truck. According to Insurance Company the rider of motor­cycle was responsible for the accident. There was no valid permit and effective valid driving licence with the driver of the truck. Therefore, there was breach of terms and conditions of the insurance policy . Hence,opponent No.2 prayed for dismissal of the claim. 05.In pursuance thereto, following issues arise for my determination and I have recorded my findings thereon for the reasons stated below. I S S U E S FINDINGS 1) Whether the accident took place due to rash or negligent driving of the truck bearing No.KA­56­0053 ?Yes. 2) Whether deceased Sham Pardeshi died in the said accident? Yes.

Details of deceased : Sr. No.Details 1) Name Sham Devendra Pardeshi 2) Age 20 years 3) Nature of occupation Tattoo maker 09. The applicant has deposed that on 7­09­2014 at about 22.45 hrs., her deceased son Sham was proceeding towards Talegaon on the motor­cycle bearing registration No.MH­14­DE­8367 as a pillion rider . When they reached at Swamy Chowk, Dehuroad, that time truck bearing registration No.KA­56­0053, coming from back side, being driven by the driver of opponent No.1, dashed to the said motor­cycle, due to which deceased son sustained grievous injuries. The truck was being driven in rash and negligent manner. Opponent Judgment in MACP No.341/2015 -6- No.1 is the owner and opponent No.2 is the Insurer of the said truck. Deceased Sham succumbed to the injuries in the hospital. 10.According to the applicant, the accident occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of offending truck. On the contrary, it is the defence of opponent No.2, the insurer of offending truck that, driver of the motor­cycle was driving the motor­cycle in rash and negligent manner. Neither party examined any eye witness to the incidence. Therefore, I have no other option, except to believe the police papers. An offence is registered against the driver of the truck. The copy of the report is filed on record. On perusal of the copies of the police papers, it appears that said accident took place because of negligence and rashness of driver of truck only. Opponent No.2 has not adduced any evidence to prove breach of terms and conditions of the insurance policy. 11.According to the applicant, deceased Sham was doing work of tattoo and thereby earning Rs.15,000/­ per month. The age of the deceased at the time of accident was 20 years. Applicant is mother of deceased Sham and she is the only dependent and legal heir of deceased Sham. A pplicant has not filed on record any document to prove the income of the deceased. She also admitted that deceased had not taken any special training for the same. However, as held in case of Ramchandrapa vs. Royal Sundram – 2011(13) SCC 236 Judgment in MACP No.341/2015 -7- Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that we can not expect the documentary evidence of income from the person working in an unorganized sector. Therefore, I hold the income of the deceased as Rs.5000/­ p.m. as a tattoo maker. It would not be exorbitant nor less. 12. Thus, @ Rs.5000/­ p.m. the total annual income of deceased comes to Rs.5000 X 12 months = Rs.60,000/ ­p.a. Applicant prayed for adding 50% increase in the income of deceased as future prospects in view of the ratio laid down in case of Shriram General Insurance Company vs. Shantilal ­ 2016(2) TAC 823 (P & H) . In the said case the Hon'ble High Court has added 50% as a future prospects in case of death of 19 years' old boy. Therefore, 50% of amount is required to be added to his income as future prospects and it comes to Rs.30,000/­. Thus, total annual income to deceased after addition of future prospects comes to Rs.60,000/­ + Rs.30,000/­= Rs.90,000/­ per year. 14.At the time of accident age of the deceased was 20 years as per postmortem report. Therefore, the multiplier of 18 is applicable for slab of 15 to 25 years, as per ratio laid down in case of Sarla Varma ­Vs­ D.T.C., AIR 2009 SC 3104. 15.Compensation Calculations : Considering the age and income of the deceased, Judgment in MACP No.341/2015 -8- the loss of future earning comes to Rs.90,000/­ X 18 = Rs.16,20,000/­ . Deceased was unmarried and, therefore, had the deceased been alive he would have spent half of his income for his livelihood and personal living­maintenance. Therefore, half of the amount is required to be deducted from Rs.16,20,000/­ and it comes to Rs.8,10,000/­ . I am granting Rs.1,00,000/­ towards loss of love and affection and Rs.25,000/­ towards funeral expenses as held in case Rajesh & others Vs. Rajbir Singh and others – 2013(9) SCC 54 , Thus, the total compensation, to which the applicant would be entitled, comes to Rs.9,35,000/­ . 16.On the date of accident the insurance policy was in force. Opponent No.2 insurance company has not addued evidence to prove any breach of terms and conditions of policy by opponent No.1. Driving licence of driver of truck is at Ex. 25, copy of permit of truck is at Ex.23. Both these documents were valid on the day of incidence. Hence, i n view of above discussion opponents No.1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the applicant . Hence, I answer points No.1 to 5 accordingly and pass the following order :­ O R D E R (1)The claim petition is partly allowed against opponents No.1 and 2 with proportionate costs. (2)Applicant is entitled for compensation of Judgment in MACP No.341/2015 -9- Rs.9,35,000/­ (Rupees Nine Lacs Thirty­five Thousand only) including N.F.L. amount, along with interest at rate of 7% from date of application till its realization, U/Sec.166 of Motor Vehicles Act, from opponents No.1 and 2 jointly and severally.

Dnyaneshwar age 17 years, died in a motor vehicular accident on 23/06/2015 at about 10­30 am., on Hadapsar road, in front of Hotel Kaweri near Railway Gate, Manjri Budruk, Pune (hereinafter referred as ''the place of occurrence''), involving Dumper bearing registration No.MH/12/HD/416 (hereinafter referred as the ''offending dumper''). Dnyaneshwar was studying in 10th standard. 3.It is the case that on 23/06/2015 at about 10­30 a.m., Dnyaneshwar was pillion rider on the said motorcycle. Motorcycle rider was riding the same at moderate speed. He was proceeding 3 MACP No.548/2015 towards school, situated on Manjari­Hadapsar road. At that time, Dumper bearing registration No.MH/12/HD/416 (hereinafter referred as the ''offending dumper'') came from opposite direction, in high and excessive speed. Offending dumper was being driven by Shivaji Nagnath Shinde (hereinafter referred as ''the offending dumper driver''). Due to high and excessive speed, he could not control over it and gave dash to the motorcycle, due to which, Dnyaneshwar fell down and sustained injuries. He was taken to Sassoon hospital and before treatment, Dnyaneshwar succumbed to injuries. Police P.S. Hadapsar took the cognizance of the accident and registered the offence vide Crime No.309/2015 under section 279, 304­A of the Indian Penal Code and 132 (1) (c), 119/177 of the Motor Vehicles Act against the offending dumper driver. 4.It is stated opponent No.1 was employee of opponent No.2. Opponent No.2 was owner of the offending dumper and same was insured with opponent No.3­ The New India Assurance Co. Ltd. (hereinafter referred as ''the opponent No.3). Therefore, opponents are jointly and severally liable to pay the just and reasonable compensation of Rs. 15,00,000/­ to the applicants. 5.Opponent Nos. 1, 2 and opponent No.3 have filed their respective written statement below Exh. 15 and 19. Some and substance of the defence is that the opponent No.1 was driver/employee of opponent No.1. Opponent No.2 was registered owner of the offending dumper and same was insured with opponent No.3. It is denied that the offending dumper driver was rash and negligent in his driving. It is also denied that offending dumper was in high and excessive speed. It is submitted that motorcycle rider had contributed to the accident. Therefore, it is stated that the motorcycle 4 MACP No.548/2015 owner and its insurance company are necessary parties to the application, but they are not made in the array of opponents and therefore, claim application is bad for non joinder of necessary parties. Age, income of Dnyaneshwar have been denied. With this, it is requested to dismiss the claim application. 6.On the rival contentions of the parties, Issues are framed at Exh.18. Those are reproduced below with my findings against each of them, for the reasons to follows­ Sr. No.Issues Findings 1 Whether the petitioners prove that on 23/06/2015 at the spot of accident, due to rash and negligent driving of driver of Dumper bearing registration No.MH/12/HD/416, accident occurred, resulting into death of Dnyaneshwar Rajendra Surwase? Yes 2 Whether the petitioners are entitled to the compensation?If yes A) To what extent? B) From whom?As per final order 3 What order? As per final order R E A S O N S 7. In order to prove the claim application, applicants have examined applicant No.2­ Rajendra N. Surwase as AW­1 below Exh.30. Thereafter, applicants did not turn to the court, hence this court closed their evidence by passing order below Exh.1 dated 21/03/2017. Opponent Nos. 1 and 2 failed to adduce their evidence. Opponent No.3 has filed its evidence close pursis below Exh.34. Apart from oral evidence, applicants have relied upon police papers of 5 MACP No.548/2015 Crime no.309/2015 of P. S. Hadapsar such as FIR (Exh.21), Spot panchanama (Exh.22), Inquest panchanama (Exh.23), medical Notification Death (Exh.24), Form Comp AA (Exh.25), Statement of Bapusaheb B. Ghule (Exh.26), Insurance policy (Exh.27), Death certificate (Exh.28),Bonafide certificate of Dnyaneshwar, Marks memo (Exh.30). 8.As to Issue No. 1:­ AW­1 is father of Dnyaneshwar. His evidence is consonance to the pleading. Evidence is also supported by police papers of Crime No.309/2015 of P. S. Hadapsar. It is below Exh. 21 to 26. I have gone through the oral evidence of AW­1 and the police papers very minutely. On going through the same, it is revealed to me that on the date of accident, Dnyaneshwar was pillion rider on motorcycle. Motorcycle was in a moderate speed. On 23/06/2015 at about 10­30 a.m., the motorcycle reached to the place of occurrence and at that time, the offending dumper came from opposite direction and recklessly gave dash to the motorcycle. Police papers further go to show that the offending dumper driver was rash and negligent. It further revealed that offending dumper was in a high and excessive speed. Therefore, I hold that applicants have proved that on 23/06/2015 at the spot of accident, due to rash and negligent driving of driver of offending dumper , accident occurred, resulting into death of Dnyaneshwar. Therefore, my answer to Issue No.1 is in the affirmative. 9.AS TO ISSUE NOS. 2 AND 3 :­ It is the contention that Dnyaneshwar was 17 years of age on the date of accident. The said evidence has not been challenged seriously. Applicants have filed the Bonafide certificate of Dnyaneshwar below Exh.29. The date of birth of Dnyaneshwar is shown as 10/11/1998. On calculation, it can safely 6 MACP No.548/2015 said that, Dnyaneshwar was 17 years on the date of accident. Therefore, I hold that Dnyaneshwar was 17 years on the date of accident. 10.Learned Advocate for opponent No.3 submitted that Dnyaneshwar was bachelor of 17 years, so, argued that in the case of bachelor, it is not age of deceased, but the age of his parents is relevant for appropriate multiplier. According to him, the parents are only sufferer because untimely death of deceased. He relied on the judgment of Hon'ble Bombay High court in the case of United India Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Sobha Amarsingh Rajput (IV (2016 ACC 407 (Bom) . But the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Kempaiah and others Vs. S. S. Murthy and another ( 2017 ACJ 1722) and in the case of National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay and others (Special Leave petition (Civil) No.25590 of 2014), considered age of deceased for appropriate multiplier. And herein this case, Dnyaneshwar was 17 years old on the date of accident. Therefore, appropriate multiplier would be 18. 11.Learned advocate for applicants, submitted that Dnyaneshwar was studying in 10th standard. Dnyaneshwar had bright future. His yearly income at Rs.30,000/­ may kindly be assessed. For that, he has relied on the observations of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Kishan Gopal and other Vs. Lala and others ( 2013 STPL 18322 SC). 12.Learned advocate for opponent No.3 argued that Dnyaneshwar was studying in 10th standard. He was 17 years old only and was non­earning member. According to him, on the basis of early age, the uncertainties in regard to his academic pursuits, achievements in career and thereafter advancement in life are so many that nothing 7 MACP No.548/2015 can be assumed with reasonable certainty. It is argued that therefore, neither the income of deceased­Dnyaneshwar is capable of assessment on estimated basis nor the financial loss suffered by the applicants is capable of mathematical computation. Therefore, income of deceased be assessed at notionally. 13.It has come on record that Dnyaneshwar was too young of 17 years. He was taking education. Considering the evidence on record and the observations of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Kishan Gopal (cited supra) in my opinion, it would be just and reasonable to assess income of Dnyaneshwar at Rs.30,000/­ per annum. By applying multiplier 18 to the income of Rs.30,000/­, total loss of income of Dnyaneshwar comes to Rs.5,40,000/­.And in view of the Judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of General Manager, Kerala State Transport Corporation, Trivendram Vs. Susama Thomas and others ( 1994 ACJ page 1 S. C.) , which is referred in Lata Wadhwa Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation (2009 ACJ 1298) (SC). Applicant No.1 being mother is entitled to get compensation of Rs.50,000/­ under the conventional heads towards loss of funeral expenses and Loss of Estate etc. Therefore, applicants are entitled to total compensation of Rs.5,90,000/­ (inclusive of interim compensation awarded under section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act) from opponent Nos. 1 to 3. Opponent Nos.1 to 3 are jointly and severally responsible for the payment of entire compensation. 14.By keeping in mind the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Municipal Corporation of Delhi V/s. Upahar Trading Victims Association and others (2011) 14 SCC 481, I hold that claimants are entitled for interest @ of 09% per annum on the 8 MACP No.548/2015 compensation amount. I, therefore answer Issue No.2 accordingly and in response to Issue No.3 , I pass following order. Order 1.The application is partly allowed with proportionate costs. 2.Opponent Nos. 1 to 3 shall jointly and severally deposit compensation of Rs.5,90,000/­(Rs. Five lakh ninety­thousand only) (including interim compensation awarded u/s.140 of the Motor Vehicles Act), with interest @ 9% per annum, from the date of petition, till realization of entire amount within 30 days from the date of passing award. a)On depositing total compensation, 60% compensation be paid to the applicant No.1, 20% compensation be paid to applicant No.2. b)Out of compensation payable to applicant No.1, amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ (Rs.

Age, income and claim of the applicant are denied. It is denied that applicant had sustained any permanent disability, affecting his income.

Age, income and claim of the applicant are denied. It is denied that applicant had sustained any permanent Judgment in MACP No.302/2015 -4- disability, affecting his income. It is denied that accident took place because of rash and negligent driving of bus. It is submitted that the applicant himself dashed against the front side of the bus and, t herefore, accident took place . Investigating Officer has wrongly filed the charge­sheet against the Non Applicant No.1. It is further contended that the claim is exorbitant and hence, prayed to dismiss the claim petition. 5] In pursuance thereto, following issues arise for my determination and I have recorded my findings thereon for the reasons stated below. I S S U E S FINDINGS 1Does applicant proves that he has sustained injuries in motor vehicular accident, which occurred on 25.7.2014, at 11 a.m, the applicant was at Shrigonda ST stand by rash and negligent driving of the ST bus bearing registration No.MH­40­M­8755 ?Partly proved. 2Does Opponent No.2 proves that the applicant has contributed to the accident ? Yes 3Whether applicant is entitled to compensation? If Yes, from whom and to what amount? Yes, from N.A. No.1 & 2. As per final order 4What Order and Award ? As per final order R E A S O N S 6] As to Issues No.1 to 3 : Judgment in MACP No.302/2015 -5- Applicant examined himself at Ex.23. His evidence affidavit is as per the contents in the application. He deposed that on 25.7.2014, at 11 a.m, he was at Shrigonda ST stand. ST bus bearing registration No.MH­40­M­8755, driven by non applicant No.1 in a rash and negligent manner, dashed him. Due to said dash, he sustained fracture to his left leg. He was taken to Hole Multispeciality Hospital, Shrigonda. Thereafter, he was shifted to YCM H ospital Pimpri, Pune. His left leg was amputate. He spent Rs.30959/­ for his treatment and Rs.15,000/­ towards special diet. Rs.50,000/­ are required for artificial leg. He relied upon FIR Ex.26, spot panchanama Ex.27, Report Ex.28, Form.Com­ AA Ex.29, Cause of injury certificate Ex.30, Driving licence of offending bus driver Ex.31. 7] In his cross­examination applicant has admitted that there was a traffic at the spot of incident and the bus was entering in the premises of ST stand. He could not see the said bus. He further admitted that he tried to catch the bus and hence fell down and then the front wheel of the ST bus run over his leg, causing injuries to leg. He fairly admitted that at the time of incident he had consumed liquor as there was “Gatar Amusha”. These admissions clearly show that applicant had consumed liquor at the time of incident and he had tried to board the bus in running condition and fell Judgment in MACP No.302/2015 -6- down. Therefore, he has contributed the accident. Thus, contributory negligence of applicant to the extent of 30 % is required to be considered here. Hence, negligence of driver of non­applicant No.1 would be to the extent of 70 %. 8] To prove the permanent disability applicant has examined Dr.Praful Govind Herode. He has stated that on 10.11.2014 he had examined the applicant and assessed the permanent disability to the extent of 60%. He further stated that the applicant had amputation from knee by 8 cm. He accordingly issued the permanent disability certificate vide Ex.35. During his cross­examination he admitted that he never treated the applicant. He further admitted that the percentage of permanent disability is of the particular leg and not the total functional disability of the entire body. He also admitted that treating doctor can assess the permanent disability properly. He further admitted that applicant can do the light work in agricultural field. There is an amputation of the leg below knee. Therefore, I consider his permanent functional disability of the whole body to the extent of 50% instead of 60% as mentioned in permanent disability certificate. 9] So far as the income of the applicant is concerned, he has stated that he was 65 years' old at the time of incident i.e. in the year 2014. He was working as a labourer at Judgment in MACP No.302/2015 -7- Wagheshwar Tyre Retreading works Wagholi and thereby getting Rs.7000/­p.m. During the cross­examination he has stated his age as 75 years as on 19.7.2017. This shows that in the year 2014, when the accident took place his age was above 70 years and below 75. Therefore, the multiplier of 5 is applicable in the present case as held in case of Sarla Verma vs. BTC – AIR 2009 SC 3104 . As far as income is concerned, applicant has stated that h e was working as a labourer at Wagheshwar Tyre Retreading works Wagholi and thereby getting Rs.7000/­p.m. He has filed on record his salary certificate but has not examined the employer. Therefore, same is not proved. Therefore, I hold his income as Rs.5000/­ p.m. notionally. Therefore, the loss of future income comes to Rs.5000 x 12 x 5 x 60% = Rs.1,50,000/­ . 10] Medical and hospital bills are of Rs.31,000/­. He has not examined the witness to prove the same. However, in view of Dattatraya Laxman Shinde (Dr.) Vs. Nana Raghunath Hire and others MANU/MH/1265/2011 Equivalent Citation: 2013ACJ474, 2011(6) Bom.C.R.553, 2011(5) Mh.L.J.854 t here is no necessity to examine the treating doctor if there is no defence that those are false and fabricated bills. Hence, applicant is entitled for Rs.31,000/­ towards medical, hospital bills etc. Applicant submitted that he would require Rs.50,000/­ for artificial leg. But, he has not Judgment in MACP No.302/2015 -8- examined any witness to that effect. Hence, he is not entitled for the same. 11]Applicant was admitted in the hospital and his left leg is amputate. Hence, applicant is entitled for Rs.50,000/­ towards pain and suffering and Rs. 15,000/­ towards special diet. Thus, applicant is entitled for total compensation amounting to Rs.1,50,000/­ + 50,000 + 15,000 + Rs.31,000/­ = Rs.2,46,000/­. 12] Now, 30% of the said amount is required to be deducted towards self contributory negligence of applicant as held above. It comes to Rs.73,800/­. Thus, applicant is actually entitled for Rs.2,46,000/­ less Rs.73,800/­ = Rs.1,72,200/­ as compensation under all the heads. Hence, I pass the following order, by answering Issues No.1 to 3 accordingly, O R D E R 1)The claim petition is partly allowed against Non­ applicants No.1 and 2. 2)Non­applicants No.1 and 2, shall jointly and severally pay, sum of Rs.1,72,200/­ (Rupees One Lac Seventy­two Thousand Two Hundred only ) including N.F.L. amount, to the applicant as a compensation U/Sec.166 of Motor Vehicles Act, with interest @ 8% per annum from the date of Judgment in MACP No.302/2015 -9- claim petition i.e. 27.04.2015 till its full realization. 3) Non­applicants shall bear their own costs. 4) Award be drawn up accordingly.

At the time of accident, offending container was insured with opponent No.2. Deceased was studying and unmarried. Applicants are the parents of deceased. They are the only legal Judgment in MACP No.627/2015 -3- heirs. 03.It is further contended by the applicant s that at the time of accident, applicant was 19 years' old. He was the student of D.Pharm, 1st year. Hence, the applicants have prayed for grant of compensation to the extent of Rs.10,00,000/­ from both the opponents jointly and severally. 04.Opponent No.1 is exparte.

It is further submitted that the deceased was not wearing helmet and, t herefore, deceased himself was responsible for the accident. Hence, it is prayed to dismiss the claim. 05.In pursuance thereto, following issues arise for my determination and I have recorded my findings thereon for the reasons stated below. I S S U E S FINDINGS 1)Whether the applicants proved that deceased Jay died in the vehicular accident dated on 27.03.2015, at 11.30 a.m, near Pulse H ospital, Narhe, Pune on account of use of container bearing registration No.Yes. Judgment in MACP No.627/2015 -4- MH­04­GC­2047 ? 2)Whether the applicants are entitled to get compensation ? If yes, to what extent ?Yes, As per final order. 3)What order ? As per final order R E A S O N S 6] As to Issues No.1 & 2 : The Applicant No.2 has adduced his own evidence by way of affidavit at Exh.13. Affidavit of the Applicant No.2 is as per the contents in the application and the applicants have relied upon following documents. 1) Report and F.I.R. Ex.19 and 20 2) insurance policy Ex.21. 3) inquest panchanama Ex.22, 4) Advance death certificate Ex.23 5) postmortem report Ex.24, 6) Form Com.AA Ex.25. 7] Applicant No.1 deposed that on 27.03.2015, at 11.30 a.m, his son Jay was driving motor­cycle bearing registration No.MH­42­X­8586. When he reached near Pulse H ospital, Narhe, Pune one container bearing registration number MH­ 04­GC­2047, being owned by opponent No.1 and driven by its driver in rash and negligent manner, gave dash to the motor­ cycle of the deceased from the back side. Due to which deceased sustained injuries and died on the spot. He further stated that the driver of the container is prosecuted by Sinhagadh Police Station vide Crime No.138/2015 for the Judgment in MACP No.627/2015 -5- offence punishable U/sec.279, 304 A, 337, 338, 427 of I.P.C. At the time of accident, offending container was insured with opponent No.2. 8] On perusal of the documents produced on record it clearly show that accident took place because of rash and negligent driving of container driver. It is also proved that said accident took place on account of use of motor vehicle as envisaged in Section 165 of M.V Act. 9] Applicant No.1 has stated that deceased was studying in First year of D.Pharm in Bharti Vidhyapeeth, Pune. He further stated that he was doing the said course because he is running a Pharmaceutical shop under the name and style as “Gandhi Medicals” at Sangvi, Pune. Deceased was the only son who could have looked after the said business. During the cross­examination he admitted that he is not the eye witness to the accident, and he does not have personal knowledge about the accident. 10] The age of the deceased was 19 years at the time of accident. He was not earning anything. He was a student. The applicants relied upon Radha Krushna and another vs Gokul 2013 ACJ 2860, S.C . wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court held the income of deceased aged 19 years, who was the student of Engineering, as Rs.15,000/­ p.m. and further Judgment in MACP No.627/2015 -6- held that only mother would be the dependent as the father has self source of income. Therefore, Supreme Court deducted 50% of his income towards the personal living expenses and the multiplier a ccording to the age of parents was considered. However, the five Judges' Bench of Supreme Court in Special Leave Petition (CIVIL) NO.25590 OF 2014 ­ National Insurance Company Limited Versus Pranay Sethi and Ors. dated 31.10.2017 have stated that the age of the deceased is only required to be considered for the multiplier and further held that funeral expenses should be Rs.15,000/­ only. The law laid down in case of Rajesh ..Vs.. Rajbirsingh (2013) 9 SCC 54 is over ruled. 11] Here the deceased was the student of D.Pharma. Therefore, I hold his income as Rs.8,000/­ p.m. The age of the deceased was 19 years. Therefore, according to the above citation of Supreme Court the multiplier of 18 is applicable. Therefore, the loss of dependency comes to Rs.8,000 x 12 x 18 = 17,28,000/­. There is only one dependent of the deceased. Therefore, 1/2 is to be deducted from Rs. 17,28,000/­ towards personal and living expenses. It comes to Rs.8,64,000/­. In addition to it, applicants are entitled for Rs.15,000/­ towards funeral expenses . Applicants are also entitled to Rs.10,000/­ towards damages for severance, pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the death as held in case of First Appeal No. 1136 of 2012, New India Assurance Company Limited Judgment in MACP No.627/2015 -7- …Vs…Sunder Manik Devendra, MANU/MH/1343/2014 , (BOMBAY), Decided On: 19.08.2014 . 12]Thus, as per the above considerations and the documents the total compensation will be as under : 1)Loss of dependency on account of death Rs.8,64,000 2)Funeral Expenses Rs.0,15,000 3) towards damages for severance, pain, suffering and trauma as a consequence of the deathRs.0,10,000 Total Compensation Payable : Rs.8,89,000 13] This amount includes the compensation paid under no fault liability. Therefore, the amount which is already paid to applicants by the non applicants, is required to be deducted from the above amount of Rs.8,89,000/­. 14] Question is who is liable to pay the same? It is proved that container bearing registration number MH­04­GC­2047 was owned by Opponent No.1 and its driver has been prosecuted for the accident in question. Said container was duly insured on the date of accident. Hence, opponents No.1 & 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation of Rs.8,89,000 /­ to the applicant s. Hence, I answer Issues No.1 to 3 accordingly and pass the following order :­ Judgment in MACP No.627/2015 -8- O R D E R [1]The claim petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs. [2] Non­applicants No.1 and 2 shall jointly and severally pay, sum of Rs.8,89,000/­ (Rupees Eight Lac Eighty­nine Thousand only) including N.F.L. amount to the applicants as a compensation U/Sec.166 of Motor Vehicles Act, with interest @ 8% per annum from the date of registration of claim petition i.e. 29.09.2015, till its full realization.

On 24.12.2014 the petitioner No.1 and deceased Hamida were returning to their home at Yerwada, from Baramati, on Hero Honda motorcycle bearing registration No.MH­12­C­8611. At Mantarwadi Fata, near Hotel Krishna Wadewale, after having some snacks, petitioner No.1 was at cash counter for payment of the bill and deceased was standing in front of hotel Krishna Wadewale near the motorcycle. At that time, one crane bearing No. MH­06­AB­ 3 MACP No.103/15-Judgment 4759 came from behind and gave dash to deceased. Due to the said dash, she died on the spot. 3] Police visited the spot, drawn the spot panchanama. They registered crime against the crane driver. It is submitted that, at the time of accident, deceased was aged about 40 years and was of sound health. She was doing tailoring work and earning Rs.9,000/­ to Rs.10,000/­ per month. Petitioners were dependent on the income of the deceased. As such, they have claimed Rs.12,00,000/­ towards damages. 4]Opponent No.1 is the owner and opponent No.2 is the insurer of the said crane. Therefore, according to petitioners, opponent Nos.1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation, along with interest @ 18% per annum under different heads. 5]Opponent No.2 resisted the claim petition by written statement and say at Ex.13. Offending vehicle crane bearing No.MH­06­AB­4759, being insured with the opponent, is admitted. It is submitted that, deceased suddenly came on road, in negligent manner without looking at both sides of the road. It is also submitted that, deceased failed to take precaution and proper attention, towards the road condition and thus due to her mistake, she sustained injuries and died thereof. Therefore, there is negligence on the part of deceased. Rest of the contents of the petition are denied. The alleged rash and negligent act, on the part of the driver of said offending vehicle, is denied. The age and income of the deceased is also denied. 4 6]Opponent No.1 resisted the claim by written statement and say at Ex.14. This opponent has denied entire contention of the claim petition. In respect of occurrence of the accident, this opponent has also raised similar contentions as that of opponent No.2. the age, occupation and income of the deceased is denied. This opponent has prayed for rejection of the claim petition. 7]The following issued are framed at Ex.15. The issues alongwith findings and reasons thereto are as under. Points Findings 1] Do petitioners prove that, due to rash and negligent driving of Carne, by its driver of opponent No.1, death of Hamida had occurred ? .. Yes. 2] Does petitioners are entitled for compensations ? If yes at what rate and from whom ? .. Yes,as per final order. 3] What order ? .. As per final order. R E A S O N S As to point No.1 and 2. :­ 8]The petitioners examined petitioner No.1 Salim Lalani at Ex.18. He deposed as per the claim petition. In cross­ examination he deposed that, when accident occurred, he was in the hotel. 9] Petitioner relied upon First Information Report Ex.22, spot panchanama Ex.23, inquest panchanama Ex.24, medical notification of death Ex.25 and Form AA Ex.26 and 5 MACP No.103/15-Judgment copy of school leaving certificate of deceased Ex.27. 10] According to the petitioner, accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle. This fact is stated on oath by the petitioner No.1. 11]On perusal of First Information Report, it is a fact that, the offence has been registered against the driver of offending vehicle, who drove the vehicle in rash and negligent manner. The spot panchanama shows the occurrence of the accident, in front of Hotel Krishna. The spot of occurrence is at a distance of 36 ft. from the road and at a distance of just 7 ft. from wall of the said hotel. This itself is sufficient to infer a rash and negligent act of driving of the crane by the driver of the opponent No.1. 12]The opponents have not adduced any evidence to show that, deceased was un­attentive and was crossing the road. From the spot of occurrence of the accident, inference cannot be drawn that, deceased was crossing the road and hence, she sustained injuries to which she succumbed. The rash and negligent act on the part of driver of opponent No.1 is proved. I answer point No.1 in affirmative. As to point No.2.:­ 13]Deceased was 40 years old, on the date of accident. Petitioners are husband and children of the deceased. Salim PW1, testified about, petitioners being dependent on the income of the deceased. According to him, deceased was doing tailoring work since last 15 years and was drawing income of Rs.9,000/­ to Rs.10,000/­ per month. 6 14]Salim PW1 also testified that, due to the unfortunate demise of his wife, he lost her company and the petitioners No.2 to 4 lost their mothers love and affection. 15]Learned advocate for the petitioners Smt. S. B. Navle submitted that, deceased was a self employed and was doing tailoring work. According to her, due to the accident, petitioner No.1 lost his wife and petitioners No.2 to 4 lost their mother. Petitioners were dependent o n the income of deceased. According to learned advocate for the petitioners, income of the deceased was Rs.9,000/­ per month. She further submitted that, thought there is no documentary evidence about income of deceased, notational income of Rs.6,000/­ be considered and 50% of it be added as future prospects. 16]Learned advocate for the petitioners relied on the case of Munnala Jain and another Vs. Vipin Kumar Sharma and others, 2015 ACJ 185 . In this decision, in case of death of a self employed pandit Hon'ble Apex Court held that, addition of 50% income be made in the actual income for purpose of compensation as future prospects. 17]Petitioners also relied on the case of Syed Sadiq and others Vs. Divisinal Manager United India Insurance Com. Ltd. 2014, ACJ 627 . In this decision, Hon'ble Apex Court held that, without proof of contributory negligence by opposite party, claimants cannot be held liable for contributing to the accident. 7 MACP No.103/15-Judgment 18]Petitioners also relied on the case of Neeta and others Vs. Divisional Manager, Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation, 2015 ACJ 598 . In this decision, Hon'ble Apex Court laid down guidelines and principles for assessment of compensation in case of accidental death of a carpenter. 19]In the present case admittedly there is no evidence about tailoring work of the deceased and income from it. The deceased was a housewife. She was looking after the petitioner No.1 and the children petitioners No.2 to 4. There is no evidence of independent witness, who had noticed tailoring work of the deceased. In such circumstances, the deceased being an housewife, her monthly notional income is considered as Rs.6,000/­. As deceased was a housewife, future prospect cannot be considered. 20]The decisions of the Hon'ble Apex Court, which are relied by the petitioners pertain to an self employed pandit and a carpenter, who was also agriculturist. Hence, the guidelines are not useful in the present case to the petitioners. 21]The income of the deceased is considered as Rs.6000/­per month. Her yearly income will be Rs.72,000/­. 1/3rd amount needs to be deducted towards personal expenses, as there are four dependents. Thus, the annual income of the deceased is assessed as Rs.48,000/­. 22]The deceased at the time of accident was aged 40 years at the time of accident. Opponents No.1 and 2 have not led any evidence to disprove this age of the deceased. So the 8 age of deceased as 40 years, is taken into consideration for assessing compensation. The multiplier applicable would be of 15. Accordingly, the compensation is worked out. As deceased was housewife, there is no assessment of compensation with regard to future prospect. 23]Thus the petitioners will be entitled for Rs.50,000/­ towards funeral expenses. Deceased was the mother of petitioners No.2 to 4, who passed away in the accident. Hence, grant of Rs.1,30,000/­ towards loss for love and affection alongwith pains and suffering, is just and proper. 24]Thus, calculations of compensations will be as follows : Loss of Dependency : Monthly income of Rs.6,000 /­ x 12 =Rs.72,000/­ (Annual Earnings)Rs.72,000/­ Less : 1/3rd towards personal expenses of the Deceased Rs.24,000/­ (Rs.72,000/­ – 24,000/­ = 48,000/­)Rs.48,000/­ Age of deceased 15 years multiplier =18. Rs.48,000 x 15 =7,20,000/­Rs.7,20,000/­ Under other permissible heads :­ •Loss for pains and sufferings, love and affection. •Funeral expenses – Rs.1,30,000/­ Rs. 50,000/­ Total Compensation Rs.9,00,000/­ 25]As such petitioners will be entitled to get Rs.9,00,000/­ inclusive of compensation awarded under section 9 MACP No.103/15-Judgment 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act as stated above. The petitioner No.4 is minor and is taking education. Hence, it would be just and proper to direct to deposit 75% amount of the compensation in fixed deposit for a period of 5 years in the name of petitioner No.4. This will ensure his further educational expenses. 26]Petitioners have claimed interest @ 18%. But it is just and proper to grant interest @ 8% per annum from the date of petition, till realization of entire amount. Hence, I pass the following order. O R D E R 1]The Petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs. 2] Opponent Nos. 1 and 2 are directed to pay jointly and severally an amount of Rs.9,00,000/­ (Rs. Nine lacs only) towards compensation (including interim compensation awarded u/s.140 of the Motor Vehicles Act), with interest @ 8%, from the date of application till its realization to the petitioner in following proportion­ a)Out of total compensation, 25% compensation be paid to the petitioner No.1. b)Out of total compensation, 75 % compensation be invested in Fixed Deposit Accounts, in the name of petitioner No.4 Shri. Aalim Salim Lalani, in any Nationalized Bank for the period of five years, by issuing separate account payee cheque, after due identification and verification. 10 3]Award be drawn accordingly.

Ganesh Vishnu Tambat died in the motor vehicular accident. Hence, the Claimants have filed this petition for compensation of Rs. 30,00,000/­ ( Rs. Thirty Lakhs only). Facts of the Claimants’ case are as under :­ [2]That on 27/04/2014 at about 09.30 p.m. deceased Ganesh Tambat was returning to his home by his motorcycle bearing No. MH­14/N­2824 by Bhosari­Nigdi road. He was riding the motorcycle in a slow and a moderate speed observing rules and regulations of road traffic. When he reached near Rishap Company, H.D.F.C. Colony, Chinchwad, on Bhosari­Nigdi road, one truck bearing No. MH­12/DT­774 was stationary on the said road. The truck was loaded with steel material. Though the truck was stationary on the road, it was not having signal or indicator to make other road­users aware about said truck. Nobody was standing near the truck to give information regarding the stationary truck. At that time, as there was darkness, and due to reflection of the head lights of the motor vehicle coming from opposite side and as there were no indicators to the said stationary truck, the deceased could not come to know about the stationary truck, and dashed against the said truck. Due to the dash, said Ganesh Tambat severe injuries on his head and multiple injuries on his person. Thereafter he was shifted from the spot and admitted in Dhanashree Hospital at Chinchwad. After first aid, Ganesh Tambat : 3 : was admitted in Command Hospital, Wanavadi, Pune. On 30.04.2014 he died when he was undergoing medical treatment in Command Hospital. [3]According to the Applicants, they incurred Rs.20,000/­ for medical treatment of Ganesh Tambat and also incurred Rs.15,000/­ for travelling and other expenses. The accident took place because the said offending truck was parked on the main road without any signal or indicator and nobody was there to give indication regarding stationary truck. Therefore, the accident took place only because of negligence on the part of the truck driver. [4]The incident was reported to M.I.D.C. Bhosari Police Station. Accordingly crime vide C.R. No. 86/2014 under Sections 279, 304­A of IPC and under Sections 119/177 and 132(1)(c) of the Motor Vehicle Act came to be registered. Police inquired into the matter. They visited to the spot of the incident and prepared panchanama of the spot. They prepared inquest panchanama of the dead body of deceased Ganesh. They recorded statements of witnesses and came to the conclusion that due to the rash and negligent act on the part of the driver of said truck bearing No. MH­12/DT­774 , the accident took place. Therefore, the said investigating officer submitted chargesheet against the said truck driver. [5]It is, further, contended by the Claimants that birth date of deceased Ganesh Tambat was 19.08.1958 and at the time of accident he was about 54 years old without having any ailment. : 4 : He was serving as maintenance Engineer in LITEX in Electrical Pvt. Ltd. Co. at Bhosari and getting salary of Rs.24000/­ per month. He was permanent employee of the said company. He was having good future and prospect in the said services. He was only earning member in the family. All the Claimants were dependent on the income of the deceased. Because of premature death of Ganesh Tambat, the Claimants have lost their main earning member. Applicant No. 1 is the wife of the deceased. Applicant Nos. 2 and 3 are minor children of the deceased, while Applicant No. 4 is widowed mother of the deceased. Considering the age of the deceased, the Claimants sustained loss of future income, loss of love and affection, loss of consortium, loss of dependency, loss of estate, funeral expenses, etc. and the Claimants assessed the amount of compensation to Rs. 30,00,000/­ (Rs. Thirty Lakhs only) under all the legal, admissible heads of damages. [6]At the material time of the accident, Opponent No.1 was the registered owner of the said truck bearing No. MH­12/DT­ 774. The said truck was validly insured with Opponent No.2 covering the date of accident. Hence, both the Opponents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the Claimants. Lastly, the Claimants prayed that compensation of Rs. 30,00,000/­ (Rs. Thirty lakhs only) with interest @ 18% per annum be awarded. [7]Opponent No.1 has filed his written statement (Exh.17). He denied the age and income of the deceased. He denied that the accident took place due to the act of the driver of : 5 : the said truck. According to him, the said truck was stationed by the side of the main road having parking indicators on. So also, the truck driver kept some stones near the stationed truck to make other road­users aware about the said truck. However, deceased Ganesh Tambat himself was riding his motorcycle in a high speed and without observing rules and regulations of road traffic and himself dashed against the stationed truck. The accident took place because of negligence on the part of the deceased himself. However, the police wrongly charge­sheeted driver of the said truck. Therefore, he is not liable to pay compensation to the Claimants. [8]He has further submitted that at the time of the incident, the said truck was validly insured with the New India Assurance Company Ltd. i.e. Opponent No. 2. Therefore, even if any liability is fasten against him of paying compensation, the same may be fasten against Opponent No. 2, being the Insurer of the said truck. On these grounds, he prayed for dismissal of the petition. [9]Opponent No.2, the Insurance Company, filed its Written Statement (Exh.16). It is submitted by Opponent No.2 that, at the relevant date and time, the offending truck bearing No. MH­12/DT­774 was insured with their Insurance Company. The driver of the offending truck was not holding effective driving license at the time of the accident. It denied the age and income of deceased and rash and negligent act on the part of the driver of the offending truck. At the time of the accident, the deceased himself drove his motorcycle rashly and negligently and dashed against the : 6 : stationary truck. Thus, due to the negligence on the part of the deceased, the accident took place. Therefore, the petition deserves to be dismissed. Compensation claimed by the Claimants is excessive and exaggerated. Hence, Opponent No. 2 prayed for dismissal of the Petition with costs. [10]I have framed issues at Exh.21 and recorded my findings thereon for the reasons stated below :­ SR. NOISSUES FINDINGS 1Whether due to rash and negligent driving of the truck bearing No. MH­12­DT­774 an accident occurred and as a consequence thereof, Mr. Ganesh Vishnu Tambat died ?Yes. 2Whether the Claimants are entitled to get compensation? If yes, what should be the quantum ?Yes. Claimants are entitled to get compensation of Rs. 12,53,723/ 3Who is liable to pay compensation ? Opponents are jointly & severally liable to pay compensation. 4What order ? Petition is allowed. : 7 : R E A S O N S AS TO ISSUE No.1 :­ [11]Smt. Aditi Ganesh Tambat, Claimant No.1 (CW1) (Exh. 23) states that on 27/04/2014 at about 09.30 p.m. her husband Ganesh Tambat was returning to his home by his motorcycle bearing No. MH­14/N­2824 on Bhosari­Nigdi road. He was riding the motorcycle in a slow and a moderate speed observing rules and regulations of road traffic. When he reached near Rishap Company,HDFC Colony, Chinchwad, on Bhosari­Nigdi road, one truck bearing No. MH­12/DT­774 was stationary on the said road without having signal or indicator to make other road­users aware about said truck. At that time, as there was darkness, and due to reflection of the head lights of the motor vehicle coming from opposite side and as there were no indicators to the said stationary truck, the deceased could not come to know about the stationary truck, and dashed against the said truck. Due to the dash, said Ganesh Tambat sustained severe head injuries and multiple injuries on his person. Thereafter he was shifted from the spot and admitted in Dhanashree hospital at Chinchwad. After first aid, Ganesh Tambat was admitted in Command Hospital, Wanavadi, Pune. On 30.04.2014 he died when he was undergoing medical treatment in Command Hospital. [12]She further states that Police of M.I.D.C. Bhosari Police Station, registered crime vide C.R. No. 86/2014 against the truck driver. She has filed certified copies of the said police papers. : 8 : [13]Claimants have produced on the record copy of chargesheet including F.I.R. (Exh.24), Spot Panchanama (Exh.26), Inquest Panchanama (Exh.27), Advanced Death Certificate (Exh.28) and Postmortem report (Exh.29). Oral evidence of Smt. Aditi Tambat (CW1) and documentary evidence produced at Exh. 24 to 29 are consistent to each other. Smt. Aditi (CW1) has been cross­examined on behalf of Opponent No.2. However, nothing significant has come on the record in favour of Opponent No.2 from the said cross­examination. [14]Considering the spot panchanama (Exh. 26) and other documents on record, I am of the opinion that the accident took place due to rash and negligent act on the part of the offending truck. I, therefore, hold that the Claimants have proved that on 27/04/2014 at about 09:30 p.m. the said accident occurred due to the rash and negligent act of the driver of the said truck bearing No.MH­12/DT­774 by which, death of Ganesh Tambat was caused. I, therefore, answer issue No.1 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE Nos. 2 and 3 :­ [15]Ld. Advocate for Opponent No.2 argued that in this accident, two motor vehicles are involved. There is contributory negligence on the part of both the vehicles. Hence, owner and insurer of both the vehicles are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation. However, the claimants have not impleaded the owner and insurer of the said motorcycle. Hence, if the Court comes to the conclusion to grant compensation against Opponent No.2, the same may be contributed to the extent of 50% only and it : 9 : may be permitted to pay and recover the said amount of compensation from the owner and driver of the offending truck. In support of his argument, he relied upon the case law ­ Raj Rani & Others Vs. Orintental Insurance Co. Ltd. & Others, 2009 ACJ 2003 (SC) and Orintental Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Ashok Ramvilasjee Vyas & Others, 2006 ACJ 879 . In the above case laws, their Lordships held driver of both the vehicles responsible for the accident and further observed that principle of '' Res ipsa loquitur '' is applicable and both the drivers were equally negligent. [16]On the other hand, Ld. Advocate for the Claimants submitted that if there is collusion between two motor vehicles and if the question of contributory negligence is there, it being joint tortfeasors, the claimant is entitled to sue both or any one of the joint tortfeasors and to recover the entire compensation as liability of joint tortfeasors is joint and several. [17]In this connection, reference can be made of the case law ­ Khenyei Vs. New India Assurance Co. Ltd. and Others, 2015 ACJ 1441, wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court held that in the case of composite negligence, plaintiff / claimant is entitled to sue both or one of the joint tortfeasors and to recover the entire compensation as liability of joint tortfeasors is joint and several. [18]In view of the ratio laid down by the Hon' ble Apex Court in the above mentioned case law, I have no hesitation to hold that the claimants can sue any one of the joint tortfeasors to recover the entire compensation. Therefore, the present petition is : 10 : maintainable even against Opponent Nos. 1 and 2, who are owner and insurer of the offending truck respectively. [19]Ld. Advocate for Opponent no. 2 submitted that at the time of the accident, the truck driver was not holding, valid and effective driving license. Hence, there was breach of condition of the Insurance Policy on the part of Opponent no. 1. Hence, Opponent no. 2 Insurance Company is not liable to pay compensation. [20]On the other hand, Ld. Advocate for the Claimants submitted that it is well settled that burden of proof ordinarily would be on Insurance Company to establish breach of policy. Mere absence of driving license or permit and production of fake or invalid driving license and permit at the relevant time, not in themselves available defences for the Insurance company. To establish that the driver of the offending motor vehicle was not holding valid driving license and permit, the Insurance Company must produce positive evidence that they had made efforts to find out whether driver of offending motor vehicle was holding valid driving license and permit. He has submitted that it is mentioned in the written statement of Opponent No. 2 that the driver of the offending truck was holding license, but it was expired on the day of the incident. In the circumstances, even if it is assumed that driving license of the truck driver was expired, it does not mean that the said driver was ineligible to driver the said vehicle. In support of his argument, he relied upon the case law ­ National Insurance Company Vs. Salouni Subhashchandra Nagzarkar & Others, 2014 ACJ 2762. : 11 : [21]In the present case, it is not in dispute that at the time of the incident, one Datta Narayan Mane was the driver of the offending truck bearing No. MH­12/DT­774. Opponent No. 2 has produced on record certified copy of the driving license of said Datta Narayan Mane alongwith list of documents (Exh.45), which shows that the said license was valid till 16/04/2014. The accident in this case occurred on 27.04.2014 . It means at the time of the incident, driver of the offending truck was not holding valid driving license. The said license was expired. As against this evidence, Opponent No. 1, who is the owner of the offending truck has not adduced any evidence. Even he has not even challenged the said documentary evidence produced by Opponent No. 2 along with list of documents Exh. 45. I, therefore find no reason to disbelieve the said certified copy of driving license of the driver of the offending truck, which shows that the said license was valid till 16.04.2014. As per the terms and conditions of the said Insurance Policy of the offending truck, a person holding valid driving license was permitted to drive the said truck. As mentioned above, at the time of the accident, Datta Mane, the driver of the offending truck was not holding valid driving license. I, therefore, hold that Opponent No. 2 has succeeded to establish that there is breach of terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy. [22]Opponent No.1 is the registered owner of the offending truck bearing No. MH­12/DT­774 and the said truck was insured with Opponent No.2 Insurance Company. The Claimants have proved that due to the rash and negligent act on the part of the driver of the offending truck bearing No. MH­12/DT­774 , the said : 12 : accident took place and in the said accident Ganesh Tambat died. However, as observed by their Lordships in the matter of Raj Rani & Others (2009 ACJ 2003) and Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. ( 2006 ACJ 879) (supra) , ''when there is case of wrongly parking of truck on road and the motorcycle dashed against the said truck in the night and the motorcycle rider sustained injuries, both the drivers are equally negligent '', I have no hesitation to hold that the claimants are entitled to get compensation from owner and insurance company of both the vehicles. However, at the same time observations made by their Lordships in the case law ­ Khenyei Vs. New India Assurance Co. Ltd. and Others, 2015 ACJ 1441, are necessary to be taken into consideration, wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court held that '' in the case of composite negligence, plaintiff / claimant is entitled to sue both or one of the joint tortfeasors and to recover the entire compensation as liability of joint tortfeasors is joint and several ''. [23]Therefore in view of the observations made by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Khenyei's case, I hold that Opponent No.1 being the registered owner and Opponent No.2 being the Insurer of the offending truck are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the Claimants and in view of the observations made in other case laws cited above, I ultimately hold that Opponent Nos. 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay 50% of compensation to the Claimants and later on Opponent No. 2 ­ Insurance Company may recover appropriate amount of compensation from the owner and driver of the offending truck No. MH­12/DT­774. : 13 : [24]Now, the question remains in respect of quantum of compensation. To prove income of the deceased, the Claimants have adduced oral evidence of Amit Vilas Mungi (CW2)(Exh.34). He is serving as Deputy Manager­ Finance in Litex Electricals Pvt. Ltd., where the deceased was serving as Senior Engineer. Amit (CW­2) states that deceased Ganesh Vishnu Tambat was serving as Senior Engineer in the said Litex Electricals Pvt. Ltd. and his gross salary for the month of March­2014 was Rs.25,950/­. In support of his oral evidence, Amit (CW­2) produced documentary evidence at Exh. 35 to 41, which shows that in the month of March ­ 2014 gross salary of deceased Ganesh Tambat was Rs. 25,950/­. [25]Amit (CW­2) was cross­examined by Opponent No.2. In the cross­examination, he has admitted that in the month of March ­ 2014 net salary of Rs.23,117/­ was credited to the salary of the deceased. Except this, nothing favourable could be brought on record from the cross­examination of Amit (CW­2). [26]Ld. Advocate for the Claimants has submitted that the Claimants have adduced sufficient evidence to show that in the month of March ­ 2014 gross salary of the deceased was Rs.25,950/­. Even if Rs.2595/­ as 10% Income­Tax and Rs.300/­ of Profession Tax is deducted from the salary of the deceased, salary of the deceased would come to Rs.23,055/­. Hence, monthly salary of the deceased may be considered as Rs.23,055/­. [27]Details of Annual Income and Income­Tax paid by the deceased are not produced on the record either by the Claimants or : 14 : his employer. Hence, the above mentioned deductions of Income­ Tax and Profession Tax appears to be acceptable. Therefore, I have no hesitation to hold that at the time of death, monthly salary of the deceased was Rs.23,055/­. [28]As mentioned above, monthly income of the deceased was assessed to Rs.23,055/­. Hence, his annual income would be Rs.2,76,660/­. It is stated by the Claimants in the petition that date of birth of the deceased was 19.08.1958. In support of this contention, Claimants have produced on record photocopy of School Leaving Certificate of deceased, wherein date of birth of the deceased is mentioned as 19.08.1959. Inquest Panchanama (Exh.27), Advanced Death Certificate (Exh.28) and Postmortem Report (Exh.29) show age of deceased Ganesh as 55 years. The above evidence regarding age of the deceased is not seriously challenged by the Opponents. I, therefore have no hesitation to hold that date of birth of the deceased was 19.08.1959. Said Ganesh Tambat died on 30.04.2014. Thus at the time of death, said Ganesh Tambat was about 55 yrs. old. In the circumstances, as per Sarla Verma's case, [AIR 2009 SC 3104(1)] multiplier of '11' is applicable for calculation of compensation amount. If annual income of Rs.2,76,660/­ is multiplied by '11' it would come to Rs. 30,43,260/­ (Rs.Thirty Lakhs forty­three thousand two­hundred sixty only). Four Claimants have filed the present petition. Thus, four persons were dependent upon the deceased. Hence, as per the settled position of law, income of the deceased shall be reduced by ¼th in consideration of the expenses which the deceased would have incurred towards maintaining himself had he been alive. : 15 : Hence, such ¼th amount comes to Rs. 7,60,850/­ (Rs. Seven Lakhs sixty­thousand eight­hundred fifty only). After deducting ¼th amount, loss of dependency would come to Rs.22,82,445/­ (Rs. Twenty­two Lakhs eighty­two thousand four­hundred forty­five only). Secondly, as settled position of law, Claimant No.1, being the widow of the deceased is entitled for compensation of Rs. 1,00,000/­ (Rs. One lakh only)on account of loss of consortium. Claimants are also entitled for compensation of Rs. 1,00,000/­ (Rs. One lakh only) on account of loss of love and affection and Rs. 25,000/­ (Rs. Twenty­five thousand only) towards funeral expenses. The Claimants have not produced any evidence about medical expenses. All these calculations can be made as follows :­ Sr. No.Particulars Amount 1Loss of dependency Rs.22,82,445/­ 2 Loss of consortium Rs. 1,00,000/­ 3 Loss of love and affection Rs. 1,00,000/­ 4 Funeral expenses Rs. 25,000/­ Total amount of compensationRs.25,07,445/­ [29]On the basis of observations made by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the matter of Raj Rani & Others (2009 ACJ 2003) and Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. ( 2006 ACJ 879) (supra) , I accept that when there is case of wrong parking of truck on road and the motorcycle dashed against the said truck in the night and the motorcycle rider sustained injuries, both the drivers are equally negligent. Therefore it is held by me that the Claimants are entitled : 16 : to get 50% of total compensation from the owner and insurance company of the offending truck. [30]As mentioned in the above calculation, it is observed that Claimants can get total compensation of Rs. 25,07,445/­ (Rs. Twenty­five Lakhs seven thousand four­hundred forty­five only). However, the Claimants are entitled to get 50% of the above mentioned total compensation, which comes to Rs. 12,53,722.50/­ i.e. rounded of Rs.12,53,723/­ (Rs. Twelve Lakhs fifty­three thousand seven­hundred twenty­three only) and Opponents are jointly and severally liable to pay the said compensation to the Claimants. I, therefore, answer point Nos. 2 and 3 accordingly. AS TO ISSUE No. 4 :­ [31]As stated above the Claimants are entitled to get compensation of Rs.12,53,723/­ (Rs. Twelve Lakhs fifty­three thousand seven­hundred twenty­three only) from Opponent Nos.1 and 2. As settled position of Law, the Claimants are entitled to get future interest @ 9% per annum on the said amount of compensation from the date of filing of this petition till its realization. The Claimants would be entitled to get costs of the petition from the Opponents. [32]As regards to apportionment of the compensation amount, as settled position of Law, Claimant No.1 being the widow of the deceased is entitled to get an amount of Rs. 1,00,000/­ along with proportionate interest thereon on account of loss of consortium. At present Claimant No.1, the mother of minor : 17 : Claimant Nos. 2 and 3 would immediately require some extra amount for livelihood of all the claimants . She has her entire life ahead to be lived without any support. Claimant Nos. 2 and 3 are minor children. They have to complete their education. For that purpose, they would require some more money than Claimant No. 4 for their maintenance and education. Claimant No. 4 is about 73 years old. Definitely she will require some less amount of money than Claimant Nos. 1 to 3 for her livelihood. Considering these aspects, I am of the opinion that it would be just and proper to distribute amount of compensation amongst the Claimants as follows :­ Claimant No. 1Loss of ConsortiumRs.1,00,000 (Rs. One Lakh Only) + proportionate interest thereon. Claimant No. 1Compensation 25% out of the compensation + proportionate interest thereon. Claimant No. 2Compensation 30% out of the compensation + proportionate interest thereon. Claimant No. 3Compensation 30% out of the compensation + proportionate interest thereon. Claimant No. 4Compensation 15% out of the compensation + proportionate interest thereon. [33]In order to safeguard the future interests of the Claimants and considering their age, I think it fit to direct investment of an amount of Rs. 1,00,000/­ (Rs. One lakh only) and Rs.50,000/­ (Rs. Fifty thousand Only) in the names of Claimant Nos. 1 and 4 respectively, in Fixed Deposit, for the period of 3 years, in any Nationalized Bank of their choice, with liberty to withdraw amount of interest accrued thereon, quarterly, if they desired. : 18 : [34]Amount of compensation including proportionate interest thereon payable to Claimant Nos. 2 and 3 be invested in their names in Fixed Deposit till they attain age of majority, in any Nationalized Bank of their choice under the guardianship of their natural guardian i.e. Claimant No. 1, with liberty to withdraw amount of interest accrued thereon, quarterly, if desired. [35]Remaining amount of compensation payable to Claimant No. 1 and 4 be paid to them by Account Payee cheques. In the result, in answer to issue No.4, I pass the following order ­­­ ORDER 1.The Claimants are entitled to get Rs.12,53,723/­ (Rs.Twelve Lakhs fifty­three thousand seven­hundred twenty­three only) towards compensation. 2.Opponent Nos. 1 and 2 subject to Clause 2­A of this order, do pay Rs. 12,53,723/­(Rs.

Ganesh Vishnu Tambat died in the motor vehicular accident. Hence, the Claimants have filed this petition for compensation of Rs. 30,00,000/­ ( Rs. Thirty Lakhs only). Facts of the Claimants’ case are as under :­ [2]That on 27/04/2014 at about 09.30 p.m. deceased Ganesh Tambat was returning to his home by his motorcycle bearing No. MH­14/N­2824 by Bhosari­Nigdi road. He was riding the motorcycle in a slow and a moderate speed observing rules and regulations of road traffic. When he reached near Rishap Company, H.D.F.C. Colony, Chinchwad, on Bhosari­Nigdi road, one truck bearing No. MH­12/DT­774 was stationary on the said road. The truck was loaded with steel material. Though the truck was stationary on the road, it was not having signal or indicator to make other road­users aware about said truck. Nobody was standing near the truck to give information regarding the stationary truck. At that time, as there was darkness, and due to reflection of the head lights of the motor vehicle coming from opposite side and as there were no indicators to the said stationary truck, the deceased could not come to know about the stationary truck, and dashed against the said truck. Due to the dash, said Ganesh Tambat severe injuries on his head and multiple injuries on his person. Thereafter he was shifted from the spot and admitted in Dhanashree Hospital at Chinchwad. After first aid, Ganesh Tambat : 3 : was admitted in Command Hospital, Wanavadi, Pune. On 30.04.2014 he died when he was undergoing medical treatment in Command Hospital. [3]According to the Applicants, they incurred Rs.20,000/­ for medical treatment of Ganesh Tambat and also incurred Rs.15,000/­ for travelling and other expenses. The accident took place because the said offending truck was parked on the main road without any signal or indicator and nobody was there to give indication regarding stationary truck. Therefore, the accident took place only because of negligence on the part of the truck driver. [4]The incident was reported to M.I.D.C. Bhosari Police Station. Accordingly crime vide C.R. No. 86/2014 under Sections 279, 304­A of IPC and under Sections 119/177 and 132(1)(c) of the Motor Vehicle Act came to be registered. Police inquired into the matter. They visited to the spot of the incident and prepared panchanama of the spot. They prepared inquest panchanama of the dead body of deceased Ganesh. They recorded statements of witnesses and came to the conclusion that due to the rash and negligent act on the part of the driver of said truck bearing No. MH­12/DT­774 , the accident took place. Therefore, the said investigating officer submitted chargesheet against the said truck driver. [5]It is, further, contended by the Claimants that birth date of deceased Ganesh Tambat was 19.08.1958 and at the time of accident he was about 54 years old without having any ailment. : 4 : He was serving as maintenance Engineer in LITEX in Electrical Pvt. Ltd. Co. at Bhosari and getting salary of Rs.24000/­ per month. He was permanent employee of the said company. He was having good future and prospect in the said services. He was only earning member in the family. All the Claimants were dependent on the income of the deceased. Because of premature death of Ganesh Tambat, the Claimants have lost their main earning member. Applicant No. 1 is the wife of the deceased. Applicant Nos. 2 and 3 are minor children of the deceased, while Applicant No. 4 is widowed mother of the deceased. Considering the age of the deceased, the Claimants sustained loss of future income, loss of love and affection, loss of consortium, loss of dependency, loss of estate, funeral expenses, etc. and the Claimants assessed the amount of compensation to Rs. 30,00,000/­ (Rs. Thirty Lakhs only) under all the legal, admissible heads of damages. [6]At the material time of the accident, Opponent No.1 was the registered owner of the said truck bearing No. MH­12/DT­ 774. The said truck was validly insured with Opponent No.2 covering the date of accident. Hence, both the Opponents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the Claimants. Lastly, the Claimants prayed that compensation of Rs. 30,00,000/­ (Rs. Thirty lakhs only) with interest @ 18% per annum be awarded. [7]Opponent No.1 has filed his written statement (Exh.17). He denied the age and income of the deceased. He denied that the accident took place due to the act of the driver of : 5 : the said truck. According to him, the said truck was stationed by the side of the main road having parking indicators on. So also, the truck driver kept some stones near the stationed truck to make other road­users aware about the said truck. However, deceased Ganesh Tambat himself was riding his motorcycle in a high speed and without observing rules and regulations of road traffic and himself dashed against the stationed truck. The accident took place because of negligence on the part of the deceased himself. However, the police wrongly charge­sheeted driver of the said truck. Therefore, he is not liable to pay compensation to the Claimants. [8]He has further submitted that at the time of the incident, the said truck was validly insured with the New India Assurance Company Ltd. i.e. Opponent No. 2. Therefore, even if any liability is fasten against him of paying compensation, the same may be fasten against Opponent No. 2, being the Insurer of the said truck. On these grounds, he prayed for dismissal of the petition. [9]Opponent No.2, the Insurance Company, filed its Written Statement (Exh.16). It is submitted by Opponent No.2 that, at the relevant date and time, the offending truck bearing No. MH­12/DT­774 was insured with their Insurance Company. The driver of the offending truck was not holding effective driving license at the time of the accident. It denied the age and income of deceased and rash and negligent act on the part of the driver of the offending truck. At the time of the accident, the deceased himself drove his motorcycle rashly and negligently and dashed against the : 6 : stationary truck. Thus, due to the negligence on the part of the deceased, the accident took place. Therefore, the petition deserves to be dismissed. Compensation claimed by the Claimants is excessive and exaggerated. Hence, Opponent No. 2 prayed for dismissal of the Petition with costs. [10]I have framed issues at Exh.21 and recorded my findings thereon for the reasons stated below :­ SR. NOISSUES FINDINGS 1Whether due to rash and negligent driving of the truck bearing No. MH­12­DT­774 an accident occurred and as a consequence thereof, Mr. Ganesh Vishnu Tambat died ?Yes. 2Whether the Claimants are entitled to get compensation? If yes, what should be the quantum ?Yes. Claimants are entitled to get compensation of Rs. 12,53,723/ 3Who is liable to pay compensation ? Opponents are jointly & severally liable to pay compensation. 4What order ? Petition is allowed. : 7 : R E A S O N S AS TO ISSUE No.1 :­ [11]Smt. Aditi Ganesh Tambat, Claimant No.1 (CW1) (Exh. 23) states that on 27/04/2014 at about 09.30 p.m. her husband Ganesh Tambat was returning to his home by his motorcycle bearing No. MH­14/N­2824 on Bhosari­Nigdi road. He was riding the motorcycle in a slow and a moderate speed observing rules and regulations of road traffic. When he reached near Rishap Company,HDFC Colony, Chinchwad, on Bhosari­Nigdi road, one truck bearing No. MH­12/DT­774 was stationary on the said road without having signal or indicator to make other road­users aware about said truck. At that time, as there was darkness, and due to reflection of the head lights of the motor vehicle coming from opposite side and as there were no indicators to the said stationary truck, the deceased could not come to know about the stationary truck, and dashed against the said truck. Due to the dash, said Ganesh Tambat sustained severe head injuries and multiple injuries on his person. Thereafter he was shifted from the spot and admitted in Dhanashree hospital at Chinchwad. After first aid, Ganesh Tambat was admitted in Command Hospital, Wanavadi, Pune. On 30.04.2014 he died when he was undergoing medical treatment in Command Hospital. [12]She further states that Police of M.I.D.C. Bhosari Police Station, registered crime vide C.R. No. 86/2014 against the truck driver. She has filed certified copies of the said police papers. : 8 : [13]Claimants have produced on the record copy of chargesheet including F.I.R. (Exh.24), Spot Panchanama (Exh.26), Inquest Panchanama (Exh.27), Advanced Death Certificate (Exh.28) and Postmortem report (Exh.29). Oral evidence of Smt. Aditi Tambat (CW1) and documentary evidence produced at Exh. 24 to 29 are consistent to each other. Smt. Aditi (CW1) has been cross­examined on behalf of Opponent No.2. However, nothing significant has come on the record in favour of Opponent No.2 from the said cross­examination. [14]Considering the spot panchanama (Exh. 26) and other documents on record, I am of the opinion that the accident took place due to rash and negligent act on the part of the offending truck. I, therefore, hold that the Claimants have proved that on 27/04/2014 at about 09:30 p.m. the said accident occurred due to the rash and negligent act of the driver of the said truck bearing No.MH­12/DT­774 by which, death of Ganesh Tambat was caused. I, therefore, answer issue No.1 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE Nos. 2 and 3 :­ [15]Ld. Advocate for Opponent No.2 argued that in this accident, two motor vehicles are involved. There is contributory negligence on the part of both the vehicles. Hence, owner and insurer of both the vehicles are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation. However, the claimants have not impleaded the owner and insurer of the said motorcycle. Hence, if the Court comes to the conclusion to grant compensation against Opponent No.2, the same may be contributed to the extent of 50% only and it : 9 : may be permitted to pay and recover the said amount of compensation from the owner and driver of the offending truck. In support of his argument, he relied upon the case law ­ Raj Rani & Others Vs. Orintental Insurance Co. Ltd. & Others, 2009 ACJ 2003 (SC) and Orintental Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Ashok Ramvilasjee Vyas & Others, 2006 ACJ 879 . In the above case laws, their Lordships held driver of both the vehicles responsible for the accident and further observed that principle of '' Res ipsa loquitur '' is applicable and both the drivers were equally negligent. [16]On the other hand, Ld. Advocate for the Claimants submitted that if there is collusion between two motor vehicles and if the question of contributory negligence is there, it being joint tortfeasors, the claimant is entitled to sue both or any one of the joint tortfeasors and to recover the entire compensation as liability of joint tortfeasors is joint and several. [17]In this connection, reference can be made of the case law ­ Khenyei Vs. New India Assurance Co. Ltd. and Others, 2015 ACJ 1441, wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court held that in the case of composite negligence, plaintiff / claimant is entitled to sue both or one of the joint tortfeasors and to recover the entire compensation as liability of joint tortfeasors is joint and several. [18]In view of the ratio laid down by the Hon' ble Apex Court in the above mentioned case law, I have no hesitation to hold that the claimants can sue any one of the joint tortfeasors to recover the entire compensation. Therefore, the present petition is : 10 : maintainable even against Opponent Nos. 1 and 2, who are owner and insurer of the offending truck respectively. [19]Ld. Advocate for Opponent no. 2 submitted that at the time of the accident, the truck driver was not holding, valid and effective driving license. Hence, there was breach of condition of the Insurance Policy on the part of Opponent no. 1. Hence, Opponent no. 2 Insurance Company is not liable to pay compensation. [20]On the other hand, Ld. Advocate for the Claimants submitted that it is well settled that burden of proof ordinarily would be on Insurance Company to establish breach of policy. Mere absence of driving license or permit and production of fake or invalid driving license and permit at the relevant time, not in themselves available defences for the Insurance company. To establish that the driver of the offending motor vehicle was not holding valid driving license and permit, the Insurance Company must produce positive evidence that they had made efforts to find out whether driver of offending motor vehicle was holding valid driving license and permit. He has submitted that it is mentioned in the written statement of Opponent No. 2 that the driver of the offending truck was holding license, but it was expired on the day of the incident. In the circumstances, even if it is assumed that driving license of the truck driver was expired, it does not mean that the said driver was ineligible to driver the said vehicle. In support of his argument, he relied upon the case law ­ National Insurance Company Vs. Salouni Subhashchandra Nagzarkar & Others, 2014 ACJ 2762. : 11 : [21]In the present case, it is not in dispute that at the time of the incident, one Datta Narayan Mane was the driver of the offending truck bearing No. MH­12/DT­774. Opponent No. 2 has produced on record certified copy of the driving license of said Datta Narayan Mane alongwith list of documents (Exh.45), which shows that the said license was valid till 16/04/2014. The accident in this case occurred on 27.04.2014 . It means at the time of the incident, driver of the offending truck was not holding valid driving license. The said license was expired. As against this evidence, Opponent No. 1, who is the owner of the offending truck has not adduced any evidence. Even he has not even challenged the said documentary evidence produced by Opponent No. 2 along with list of documents Exh. 45. I, therefore find no reason to disbelieve the said certified copy of driving license of the driver of the offending truck, which shows that the said license was valid till 16.04.2014. As per the terms and conditions of the said Insurance Policy of the offending truck, a person holding valid driving license was permitted to drive the said truck. As mentioned above, at the time of the accident, Datta Mane, the driver of the offending truck was not holding valid driving license. I, therefore, hold that Opponent No. 2 has succeeded to establish that there is breach of terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy. [22]Opponent No.1 is the registered owner of the offending truck bearing No. MH­12/DT­774 and the said truck was insured with Opponent No.2 Insurance Company. The Claimants have proved that due to the rash and negligent act on the part of the driver of the offending truck bearing No. MH­12/DT­774 , the said : 12 : accident took place and in the said accident Ganesh Tambat died. However, as observed by their Lordships in the matter of Raj Rani & Others (2009 ACJ 2003) and Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. ( 2006 ACJ 879) (supra) , ''when there is case of wrongly parking of truck on road and the motorcycle dashed against the said truck in the night and the motorcycle rider sustained injuries, both the drivers are equally negligent '', I have no hesitation to hold that the claimants are entitled to get compensation from owner and insurance company of both the vehicles. However, at the same time observations made by their Lordships in the case law ­ Khenyei Vs. New India Assurance Co. Ltd. and Others, 2015 ACJ 1441, are necessary to be taken into consideration, wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court held that '' in the case of composite negligence, plaintiff / claimant is entitled to sue both or one of the joint tortfeasors and to recover the entire compensation as liability of joint tortfeasors is joint and several ''. [23]Therefore in view of the observations made by the Hon'ble Apex Court in Khenyei's case, I hold that Opponent No.1 being the registered owner and Opponent No.2 being the Insurer of the offending truck are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the Claimants and in view of the observations made in other case laws cited above, I ultimately hold that Opponent Nos. 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay 50% of compensation to the Claimants and later on Opponent No. 2 ­ Insurance Company may recover appropriate amount of compensation from the owner and driver of the offending truck No. MH­12/DT­774. : 13 : [24]Now, the question remains in respect of quantum of compensation. To prove income of the deceased, the Claimants have adduced oral evidence of Amit Vilas Mungi (CW2)(Exh.34). He is serving as Deputy Manager­ Finance in Litex Electricals Pvt. Ltd., where the deceased was serving as Senior Engineer. Amit (CW­2) states that deceased Ganesh Vishnu Tambat was serving as Senior Engineer in the said Litex Electricals Pvt. Ltd. and his gross salary for the month of March­2014 was Rs.25,950/­. In support of his oral evidence, Amit (CW­2) produced documentary evidence at Exh. 35 to 41, which shows that in the month of March ­ 2014 gross salary of deceased Ganesh Tambat was Rs. 25,950/­. [25]Amit (CW­2) was cross­examined by Opponent No.2. In the cross­examination, he has admitted that in the month of March ­ 2014 net salary of Rs.23,117/­ was credited to the salary of the deceased. Except this, nothing favourable could be brought on record from the cross­examination of Amit (CW­2). [26]Ld. Advocate for the Claimants has submitted that the Claimants have adduced sufficient evidence to show that in the month of March ­ 2014 gross salary of the deceased was Rs.25,950/­. Even if Rs.2595/­ as 10% Income­Tax and Rs.300/­ of Profession Tax is deducted from the salary of the deceased, salary of the deceased would come to Rs.23,055/­. Hence, monthly salary of the deceased may be considered as Rs.23,055/­. [27]Details of Annual Income and Income­Tax paid by the deceased are not produced on the record either by the Claimants or : 14 : his employer. Hence, the above mentioned deductions of Income­ Tax and Profession Tax appears to be acceptable. Therefore, I have no hesitation to hold that at the time of death, monthly salary of the deceased was Rs.23,055/­. [28]As mentioned above, monthly income of the deceased was assessed to Rs.23,055/­. Hence, his annual income would be Rs.2,76,660/­. It is stated by the Claimants in the petition that date of birth of the deceased was 19.08.1958. In support of this contention, Claimants have produced on record photocopy of School Leaving Certificate of deceased, wherein date of birth of the deceased is mentioned as 19.08.1959. Inquest Panchanama (Exh.27), Advanced Death Certificate (Exh.28) and Postmortem Report (Exh.29) show age of deceased Ganesh as 55 years. The above evidence regarding age of the deceased is not seriously challenged by the Opponents. I, therefore have no hesitation to hold that date of birth of the deceased was 19.08.1959. Said Ganesh Tambat died on 30.04.2014. Thus at the time of death, said Ganesh Tambat was about 55 yrs. old. In the circumstances, as per Sarla Verma's case, [AIR 2009 SC 3104(1)] multiplier of '11' is applicable for calculation of compensation amount. If annual income of Rs.2,76,660/­ is multiplied by '11' it would come to Rs. 30,43,260/­ (Rs.Thirty Lakhs forty­three thousand two­hundred sixty only). Four Claimants have filed the present petition. Thus, four persons were dependent upon the deceased. Hence, as per the settled position of law, income of the deceased shall be reduced by ¼th in consideration of the expenses which the deceased would have incurred towards maintaining himself had he been alive. : 15 : Hence, such ¼th amount comes to Rs. 7,60,850/­ (Rs. Seven Lakhs sixty­thousand eight­hundred fifty only). After deducting ¼th amount, loss of dependency would come to Rs.22,82,445/­ (Rs. Twenty­two Lakhs eighty­two thousand four­hundred forty­five only). Secondly, as settled position of law, Claimant No.1, being the widow of the deceased is entitled for compensation of Rs. 1,00,000/­ (Rs. One lakh only)on account of loss of consortium. Claimants are also entitled for compensation of Rs. 1,00,000/­ (Rs. One lakh only) on account of loss of love and affection and Rs. 25,000/­ (Rs. Twenty­five thousand only) towards funeral expenses. The Claimants have not produced any evidence about medical expenses. All these calculations can be made as follows :­ Sr. No.Particulars Amount 1Loss of dependency Rs.22,82,445/­ 2 Loss of consortium Rs. 1,00,000/­ 3 Loss of love and affection Rs. 1,00,000/­ 4 Funeral expenses Rs. 25,000/­ Total amount of compensationRs.25,07,445/­ [29]On the basis of observations made by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the matter of Raj Rani & Others (2009 ACJ 2003) and Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. ( 2006 ACJ 879) (supra) , I accept that when there is case of wrong parking of truck on road and the motorcycle dashed against the said truck in the night and the motorcycle rider sustained injuries, both the drivers are equally negligent. Therefore it is held by me that the Claimants are entitled : 16 : to get 50% of total compensation from the owner and insurance company of the offending truck. [30]As mentioned in the above calculation, it is observed that Claimants can get total compensation of Rs. 25,07,445/­ (Rs. Twenty­five Lakhs seven thousand four­hundred forty­five only). However, the Claimants are entitled to get 50% of the above mentioned total compensation, which comes to Rs. 12,53,722.50/­ i.e. rounded of Rs.12,53,723/­ (Rs. Twelve Lakhs fifty­three thousand seven­hundred twenty­three only) and Opponents are jointly and severally liable to pay the said compensation to the Claimants. I, therefore, answer point Nos. 2 and 3 accordingly. AS TO ISSUE No. 4 :­ [31]As stated above the Claimants are entitled to get compensation of Rs.12,53,723/­ (Rs. Twelve Lakhs fifty­three thousand seven­hundred twenty­three only) from Opponent Nos.1 and 2. As settled position of Law, the Claimants are entitled to get future interest @ 9% per annum on the said amount of compensation from the date of filing of this petition till its realization. The Claimants would be entitled to get costs of the petition from the Opponents. [32]As regards to apportionment of the compensation amount, as settled position of Law, Claimant No.1 being the widow of the deceased is entitled to get an amount of Rs. 1,00,000/­ along with proportionate interest thereon on account of loss of consortium. At present Claimant No.1, the mother of minor : 17 : Claimant Nos. 2 and 3 would immediately require some extra amount for livelihood of all the claimants . She has her entire life ahead to be lived without any support. Claimant Nos. 2 and 3 are minor children. They have to complete their education. For that purpose, they would require some more money than Claimant No. 4 for their maintenance and education. Claimant No. 4 is about 73 years old. Definitely she will require some less amount of money than Claimant Nos. 1 to 3 for her livelihood. Considering these aspects, I am of the opinion that it would be just and proper to distribute amount of compensation amongst the Claimants as follows :­ Claimant No. 1Loss of ConsortiumRs.1,00,000 (Rs. One Lakh Only) + proportionate interest thereon. Claimant No. 1Compensation 25% out of the compensation + proportionate interest thereon.

Claimant No. 4Compensation 15% out of the compensation + proportionate interest thereon. [33]In order to safeguard the future interests of the Claimants and considering their age, I think it fit to direct investment of an amount of Rs. 1,00,000/­ (Rs. One lakh only) and Rs.50,000/­ (Rs. Fifty thousand Only) in the names of Claimant Nos. 1 and 4 respectively, in Fixed Deposit, for the period of 3 years, in any Nationalized Bank of their choice, with liberty to withdraw amount of interest accrued thereon, quarterly, if they desired. : 18 : [34]Amount of compensation including proportionate interest thereon payable to Claimant Nos. 2 and 3 be invested in their names in Fixed Deposit till they attain age of majority, in any Nationalized Bank of their choice under the guardianship of their natural guardian i.e. Claimant No. 1, with liberty to withdraw amount of interest accrued thereon, quarterly, if desired.

In the result, in answer to issue No.4, I pass the following order ­­­ ORDER 1.The Claimants are entitled to get Rs.12,53,723/­ (Rs.Twelve Lakhs fifty­three thousand seven­hundred twenty­three only) towards compensation. 2.Opponent Nos. 1 and 2 subject to Clause 2­A of this order, do pay Rs. 12,53,723/­(Rs.

Petitioner. Versus Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mandal Ltd. Shankar Sheth road, Swargate, Pune. .. Opponent. Appearances:­ Shri. A. B. Gunjal, advocate for the petitioner. Shri. G. P. Shinde, advocate for opponent. Claim of Rs.40,00,000/­. 2 J U D G M E N T (Delivered on 30 th day of April 2016 ) Petition is for the compensation in respect of injury sustained in motor vehicular accident dated 21.05.2014. 2]The facts of the case in brief, are as under : On 21.05.2014 at about 20.45 hours, petitioner was pillion rider on motorcycle bearing No.MH­14­AX­9749, driven by her father. They were proceeding towards the home, they reached Dhobi Ghat road, at river road, Pimpri, Pune. At that time, on bus bearing No. MH­12­HB­376, came from behind and dashed the motorcycle. Due to dash, petitioner sustained injuries to her left leg. 3]After the accident, petitioner was admitted to YCM Hospital, Pune. She was treated in that hospital till 27.06.2014. Her left leg was amputated above knee. She was again admitted on 17.07.2014 for skin graft and was discharged on 18.07.2014. The petitioner had incurred amount of Rs.7,25,000/­ as medical expenses, Rs.20,000/­ for traveling and Rs.10,000/­ for special diet. The petitioner is in need of Rs.10,00,000/­ for future medical treatment. Due to the accident, petitioner cannot walk and work for longer period. The petitioner has sustained permanent disability, due to accident. 4]The petitioner further submitted that, at the time of accident, she was of 14 years, having good health and studying in 10th standard. She will have difficulties in her marriage. Hence, she has claimed compensation of Rs.40,00,000/­ from 3 MACP No.131-16-Judgment the opponent. 5]Opponent is the owner of the offending bus. Driver of the said bus is responsible for the accident. Hence, the petitioner has claimed compensation from the opponent alongwith interest at the rate of 18% p.a. 6]Opponent has filed the written statement and say at Ex.9. It is contended that, the petitioner has not made party to the insurer and owner of the motorcycle involved in the accident. Hence, claim deserves to be dismissed, for non joinder of necessary parties. It is contended that, the said offending bus was proceeding from Pimpri to Bhosari. When bus came near Jijamata Hospital, there was procession on the said road. The traffic was proceeding very slowly. The motorcyclist, while overtaking the bus, by its wrong side, was abusing the bus driver. Thereafter, said motorcyclist stopped his motorcycle in front of the bus. Hence, bus driver blown horn repeatedly. But motorcyclist deliberately neglected the same and did not take his motorcycle away. There was sufficient road to park his motorcycle. Thus, motorcyclist i.e. father of the injured, is solely responsible for the said accident. The opponent denied all the police papers, age and income of the petitioner. It is contended by the opponent that, it is not liable to pay the compensation. The claim of the petitioner is excessive and exorbitant. Hence, prayed for rejection of the petition with cost. 7]Considering the contentions of both the parties, issues were framed at Ex.10. The findings thereon for the reasons thereto, are as follows. 4 Issues Findings 1Whether petitioner prove that on 21.05.2014 at about 20.45 hours, in front of Dhobi Ghat road, near river side, Pimpri, Pune, due to rash and negligent driving of bus bearing registration No. MH­12­ HB­376, petitioner sustained injuries ?.. Yes. 2Whether the petitioner is entitled to compensation ? If yes, A] To what extent ? ..Partly yes. 3What order ? .. As per the final order. R E A S O N S As To Issues No. 1 and 2. :­ 8] To establish the claim, petitioner examined her father Anthoni at Ex.12 and one doctor Pravin PW2 of Sassoon Hospital, Pune at Ex.24. The opponent on its behalf examined bus driver of PMPML Ashok at Ex.29. 9] The petitioner has placed reliance on the police papers. She has produced on record the medical bills, disability certificate (Ex.27), First Information Report Ex.13, Form Comp. AA Ex.16. 10] Anthoni, is the father of injured, who testified that, on the day of accident, while proceeding towards home, when he reached Dhobi Ghat, Pimpri, one bus came in high and excessive speed. The bus driver lost control and dashed to the motorcycle from behind. Therefore, the pillion rider, i.e. his 5 MACP No.131-16-Judgment daughter sustained injures to her left leg, knee etc. In the cross­ examination he testified that, the distance between spot of accident and procession on the road, was of 0.50 to 0.75 k.m. He denied rest of the contents in cross­examination. 11]The First Information Report is at Ex.13. Crime for rash and negligent driving was lodged against Ashok DW1, driver of the offending bus. The spot panchanama is at Ex.14. Spot panchanama shows that, at the spot of accident, the offending bus was at a distance of 1.5 ft. from the end of the road towards the north side. The motorcycle was under the left front wheel of the offending bus. Anthoni in his police statement Ex.15 had stated that, the offending bus came from behind and heavily dashed his motorcycle. The injured fell down and sustained injury to her left leg. 12]Ashok DW1 is the driver of the offending bus. According to him, he was driving the bus in slow speed, as there was a procession going on ahead of his bus. According to him, at the spot of accident, father of the injured came from wrong side, in front of his bus and started abusing him. He applied breaks. There was only a touch of the bus to the motorcycle. 13]In the cross­examination, this witness testified that, crime was registered against him and a case for offence of rash and negligent driving is pending. He admits that, dash to the motorcycle is from the cleaner's side of the bus. He also admitted that, the procession on the said road was ahead of the bus, at about half k.m. 6 14]Opponent by examining Ashok DW1, have tried to establish that, the father of the injured was negligent. But they have failed. The reason for the same is that, admittedly the procession on the said road was ahead, at a distance of half k.m. from the bus. The spot panchanama and even the oral evidence of Ashok DW1, shows that, dash of the bus to the motorcycle is from the cleaner's side of the bus. The spot panchanama shows that, the motorcycle was below the front left wheel of the bus. 15]From the aforesaid evidence on record, the fact that, the bus was driven in a slow speed, due to a procession, is not established. There is no substance in the defence of the opponent that, the father of injured, came from wrong side, abusing and halted in front of the bus. The admission of Ashok DW1 about the spot of the procession, is sufficient to draw an inference that, the procession had no concern with the occurrence of the accident. As the motorcycle came beneath the left front wheel of the bus, the rash and negligent act is established. Due to the negligent driving of the bus, injured Alpha sustained injuries, is proved. Hence, I answer point No.1 in the affirmative. As to point No.2. :­ 16]Anthoni PW1 testified that, after the accident, injured Alpha was shifted to YCM hospital and thereafter, to Aditya Birla Hospital, for a period of 21.05.2014 to 27.06.2014 as indoor patient. Nine operations were performed on the injured. He has spent Rs.7,25,000/­ for the treatment. He 7 MACP No.131-16-Judgment further testified that, injured Alpha was of 14 years old and was studied in 10th standard. Now due to the accident, her left leg is amputated from knee and she has a permanent disability. Injured Alpha was a sport girl. Due to the accident, she has lost said skill. He also testified about loss of marriage prospects of the injured. In the cross­examination, except the fact that, this witness had availed advance of Rs.2.5 lacs on two occasions from Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, nothing is brought on record. Regarding this advance, this witness testified that, he is required to repay it. 17]Petitioner examined Dr. Pravin PW2, medical officer of Sassoon Hospital, Pune. According to this witness, injured has sustained 85% permanent disability. Accordingly, the disability certificate Ex.27 was issued. It is further brought on record that, due to the said disability, the injured cannot lead normal life in her future, she has lost her marriage prospects. In cross­examination this witness testified that, patients like the injured, can lead normal life to some extent by use of artificial limb. 18]Petitioner have produced all the medical bills on record. These are below list Ex.6. In all 16 bills are produced on record. These bills include bills of medicines, bill of Aditya Birla Hospital. The total amount of these bills is Rs 6,42,363/­. 19]It be noted that, opponent has not disputed authenticity of these medical bills. Hon'ble Parent High Court in the case of Dr. Dattatraya Laxman Shinde Vs. Nana Raghunath Hire, 2013 ACJ 474 , has laid down a principle 8 that, “When no specific case of fabrication of bills, vouchers is made out, and when the claimant had referred these bills and vouchers in his evidence, the Tribunal is not bound by strict rules of evidence. Such bills and vouchers can be taken into consideration”. 20]Hence, straight way the medical expenses of Rs.6,42,363/­ are taken into consideration while assessing the compensation. 21]Learned advocate for the petitioner relied on the case of Dinesh Singh Vs. Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Com. Ltd. 2015(2) Mh.L.J. 32 . In this decision Hon'ble Apex Court has laid down guidelines in respect of grant of compensation for permanent disability sustained in accidental injury case. 22]Learned advocate for the petitioner also relied on the case of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation Ltd. Vs. R. Muralidharan, 2010 ACJ 1301 . In this decision also, guidelines are laid down regarding grant of compensation in accidental injury cases. 23]Aforesaid guidelines are taken into consideration for assessment of compensation. 24]At the time of accident, injured Alpha was aged of 14 years, is not much disputed. The fact that, she was studying in 10th standard is also not much disputed. In the said accident, injured Alpha sustained injury to her left leg. She had taken treatment in Aditya Birla hospital, where nine operations were 9 MACP No.131-16-Judgment performed. Finally, her left leg from knee was amputated. The disability certificate issued by Dr. Pravin PW2, cannot be disbelieved. There is no reason to justify that, this permanent disability of 85% is at a higher side. It be noted that, injured Alpha in the age of her adolescence, met with the accident and lost her left leg from knee. Hence, the petitioner is entitled for loss of earnings due to the permanent disability. Notional income of the deceased of Rs.5,000/­ is considered for this purpose. 25]As notional income of Rs.5,000/­ per month is considered, the early income would be Rs.60,000/­. As age of the injured is 14 years, the multiplier applicable will be of 18. Thus, the income comes to Rs.10,80,000/­. As the permanent disability is of 85%, the loss of earnings comes to Rs.9,18,000/­. 26]As the injured has sustained an 85% permanent disability in the said accident, she is also entitled for non­ pecuniary damages. Injured Alpha due to the said accident has suffered pains. Her left leg from knee is amputated. Hence, an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ towards pains and suffering is awarded. 27]Due to the said accidental injury, certainly marriage prospects of injured Alpha has an serious impact. Injured Alpha due to the said permanent disability, will not be in a position to get marry like a normal girl. Hence, for loss of marriage prospects, an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ is awarded. 10 28]It is the pleadings and the evidence of the petitioner that, injured Alpha, prior to the accident was a good sport girl. Now with the permanent disability, she has lost the prospect of becoming a sport woman. Due to the permanent disability, injured Alpha has also lost normal enjoyment of the life. Hence, for loss of amenities an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ is awarded. 29]Besides this, for special diet due to the accidental injury and for conveyance, an amount of Rs.50,000/­ each is just and proper. 30]Thus calculations of compensation will be as follows : Pecuniary Damages Medical Expenses actually incurred – Rs. 6,42,363/­ Loss of future earnings of injured (Rs.5,000/­ x 12 = 60,000/­ X 18 =Rs,10,80,000/­ divided by 85% = Rs.9,18,000/­ )Rs. 9,18,000/­ Non­Pecuniary damages – a] Loss for pains & sufferings Rs. 1,00,000/­ b] Loss of marriage prospects Rs. 1,00,000/­ c]Loss of amenities Rs. 1,00,000/­ d] Special diet Rs. 50,000/­ e] Conveyance Rs. 50,000/­ TOTAL Rs.19,60,363/­ 31]Petitioner has claimed interest @ 18%. But grant of future interest, is the discretion of the tribunal. Considering the nature of the claim, it would just and proper to grant interest @ 8% per annum, from the date of petition, till realization of 11 MACP No.131-16-Judgment entire amount. Accordingly, I answer issue No.2 partly in the affirmative. 32]Learned advocate for the opponent submitted that, Anthoni PW1 admitted about receipt of Rs.4,50,000/­ as advance from Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation. Hence, this amount should be deducted from final figure of compensation. 33]It is an admitted fact that, Anthoni PW1 is employee of Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation. He admitted about receipt of Rs.2.25 lacs on two occasions, as advance from his employer. But he further testified that, he has to repay this advance amount. It be noted that all the original medical bills of the treatment of injured Alpha, are produced before me. In such circumstances, I am of the view that, it will not be just and proper to deduct the aforesaid amount from final compensation. The opponent has to adduce cogent evidence, to show that, the aforesaid advance amount is not refundable and the petitioner had already received it. In absence of such evidence, the aforesaid amount cannot be deducted. 34]Thus the petitioner is entitled for Rs.19,60,363/­ as compensation from opponent, alongwith interest at the rate of 8% p.a. Considering the age, disability of injured Alpha, an amount of Rs.10,00,000/­, needs to be placed in fixed deposit, for a period of three years. This is in the interest of injured Alpha and to secure her future, on attaining age of majority. 12 35] Hence, petition is partly allowed as under : O R D E R 1]The petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs. 2]Opponent is hereby directed to pay compensation of Rs.19,60,363/­ (Rupees Nineteen Lacs, Sixty Thousands, Three Hundred and Sixty­Three only) along with interest @ 8% per annum, from the date of petition, till realization of entire amount to the petitioners. a] Out of the total compensation of Rs.19,60,363/­ (Rupees Nineteen Lacs, Sixty Thousands, Three Hundred and Sixty­Three only), an amount of Rs.10,00,000/­ (Rupees Ten Lacs only) be deposited in fixed deposit, for a period of three years in the name of petitioner Alpha, by issuing separate account payee cheque in her name of any nationalized bank. b] The balance amount of Rs.9,60,363/­ (Rs. Nine Lacs, Sixty Thousands, Three Hundred and Sixty­Three only) be paid to the petitioner Alpha, by issuing separate account payee cheque in her name. 3]Award be drawn accordingly.

Hence, prayed for rejection of the petition with cost. 7]Considering the contentions of both the parties, issues were framed at Ex.10.

Yes. 2Whether the petitioner is entitled to compensation ? If yes, A] To what extent ? ..Partly yes. 3What order ? .. As per the final order. R E A S O N S As To Issues No. 1 and 2. :­ 8] To establish the claim, petitioner examined her father Anthoni at Ex.12 and one doctor Pravin PW2 of Sassoon Hospital, Pune at Ex.24. The opponent on its behalf examined bus driver of PMPML Ashok at Ex.29. 9] The petitioner has placed reliance on the police papers. She has produced on record the medical bills, disability certificate (Ex.27), First Information Report Ex.13, Form Comp. AA Ex.16. 10] Anthoni, is the father of injured, who testified that, on the day of accident, while proceeding towards home, when he reached Dhobi Ghat, Pimpri, one bus came in high and excessive speed. The bus driver lost control and dashed to the motorcycle from behind. Therefore, the pillion rider, i.e. his 5 MACP No.131-16-Judgment daughter sustained injures to her left leg, knee etc. In the cross­ examination he testified that, the distance between spot of accident and procession on the road, was of 0.50 to 0.75 k.m. He denied rest of the contents in cross­examination. 11]The First Information Report is at Ex.13. Crime for rash and negligent driving was lodged against Ashok DW1, driver of the offending bus. The spot panchanama is at Ex.14. Spot panchanama shows that, at the spot of accident, the offending bus was at a distance of 1.5 ft. from the end of the road towards the north side. The motorcycle was under the left front wheel of the offending bus. Anthoni in his police statement Ex.15 had stated that, the offending bus came from behind and heavily dashed his motorcycle. The injured fell down and sustained injury to her left leg. 12]Ashok DW1 is the driver of the offending bus. According to him, he was driving the bus in slow speed, as there was a procession going on ahead of his bus. According to him, at the spot of accident, father of the injured came from wrong side, in front of his bus and started abusing him. He applied breaks. There was only a touch of the bus to the motorcycle. 13]In the cross­examination, this witness testified that, crime was registered against him and a case for offence of rash and negligent driving is pending. He admits that, dash to the motorcycle is from the cleaner's side of the bus. He also admitted that, the procession on the said road was ahead of the bus, at about half k.m. 6 14]Opponent by examining Ashok DW1, have tried to establish that, the father of the injured was negligent. But they have failed. The reason for the same is that, admittedly the procession on the said road was ahead, at a distance of half k.m. from the bus. The spot panchanama and even the oral evidence of Ashok DW1, shows that, dash of the bus to the motorcycle is from the cleaner's side of the bus. The spot panchanama shows that, the motorcycle was below the front left wheel of the bus. 15]From the aforesaid evidence on record, the fact that, the bus was driven in a slow speed, due to a procession, is not established. There is no substance in the defence of the opponent that, the father of injured, came from wrong side, abusing and halted in front of the bus. The admission of Ashok DW1 about the spot of the procession, is sufficient to draw an inference that, the procession had no concern with the occurrence of the accident. As the motorcycle came beneath the left front wheel of the bus, the rash and negligent act is established. Due to the negligent driving of the bus, injured Alpha sustained injuries, is proved. Hence, I answer point No.1 in the affirmative. As to point No.2. :­ 16]Anthoni PW1 testified that, after the accident, injured Alpha was shifted to YCM hospital and thereafter, to Aditya Birla Hospital, for a period of 21.05.2014 to 27.06.2014 as indoor patient. Nine operations were performed on the injured. He has spent Rs.7,25,000/­ for the treatment. He 7 MACP No.131-16-Judgment further testified that, injured Alpha was of 14 years old and was studied in 10th standard. Now due to the accident, her left leg is amputated from knee and she has a permanent disability. Injured Alpha was a sport girl. Due to the accident, she has lost said skill. He also testified about loss of marriage prospects of the injured. In the cross­examination, except the fact that, this witness had availed advance of Rs.2.5 lacs on two occasions from Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation, nothing is brought on record. Regarding this advance, this witness testified that, he is required to repay it. 17]Petitioner examined Dr. Pravin PW2, medical officer of Sassoon Hospital, Pune. According to this witness, injured has sustained 85% permanent disability. Accordingly, the disability certificate Ex.27 was issued. It is further brought on record that, due to the said disability, the injured cannot lead normal life in her future, she has lost her marriage prospects. In cross­examination this witness testified that, patients like the injured, can lead normal life to some extent by use of artificial limb. 18]Petitioner have produced all the medical bills on record. These are below list Ex.6. In all 16 bills are produced on record. These bills include bills of medicines, bill of Aditya Birla Hospital. The total amount of these bills is Rs 6,42,363/­. 19]It be noted that, opponent has not disputed authenticity of these medical bills. Hon'ble Parent High Court in the case of Dr. Dattatraya Laxman Shinde Vs. Nana Raghunath Hire, 2013 ACJ 474 , has laid down a principle 8 that, “When no specific case of fabrication of bills, vouchers is made out, and when the claimant had referred these bills and vouchers in his evidence, the Tribunal is not bound by strict rules of evidence. Such bills and vouchers can be taken into consideration”. 20]Hence, straight way the medical expenses of Rs.6,42,363/­ are taken into consideration while assessing the compensation. 21]Learned advocate for the petitioner relied on the case of Dinesh Singh Vs. Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Com. Ltd. 2015(2) Mh.L.J. 32 . In this decision Hon'ble Apex Court has laid down guidelines in respect of grant of compensation for permanent disability sustained in accidental injury case. 22]Learned advocate for the petitioner also relied on the case of Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation Ltd. Vs. R. Muralidharan, 2010 ACJ 1301 . In this decision also, guidelines are laid down regarding grant of compensation in accidental injury cases. 23]Aforesaid guidelines are taken into consideration for assessment of compensation. 24]At the time of accident, injured Alpha was aged of 14 years, is not much disputed. The fact that, she was studying in 10th standard is also not much disputed. In the said accident, injured Alpha sustained injury to her left leg. She had taken treatment in Aditya Birla hospital, where nine operations were 9 MACP No.131-16-Judgment performed. Finally, her left leg from knee was amputated. The disability certificate issued by Dr. Pravin PW2, cannot be disbelieved. There is no reason to justify that, this permanent disability of 85% is at a higher side. It be noted that, injured Alpha in the age of her adolescence, met with the accident and lost her left leg from knee. Hence, the petitioner is entitled for loss of earnings due to the permanent disability. Notional income of the deceased of Rs.5,000/­ is considered for this purpose. 25]As notional income of Rs.5,000/­ per month is considered, the early income would be Rs.60,000/­. As age of the injured is 14 years, the multiplier applicable will be of 18. Thus, the income comes to Rs.10,80,000/­. As the permanent disability is of 85%, the loss of earnings comes to Rs.9,18,000/­. 26]As the injured has sustained an 85% permanent disability in the said accident, she is also entitled for non­ pecuniary damages. Injured Alpha due to the said accident has suffered pains. Her left leg from knee is amputated. Hence, an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ towards pains and suffering is awarded. 27]Due to the said accidental injury, certainly marriage prospects of injured Alpha has an serious impact. Injured Alpha due to the said permanent disability, will not be in a position to get marry like a normal girl. Hence, for loss of marriage prospects, an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ is awarded. 10 28]It is the pleadings and the evidence of the petitioner that, injured Alpha, prior to the accident was a good sport girl. Now with the permanent disability, she has lost the prospect of becoming a sport woman. Due to the permanent disability, injured Alpha has also lost normal enjoyment of the life. Hence, for loss of amenities an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ is awarded. 29]Besides this, for special diet due to the accidental injury and for conveyance, an amount of Rs.50,000/­ each is just and proper. 30]Thus calculations of compensation will be as follows : Pecuniary Damages Medical Expenses actually incurred – Rs. 6,42,363/­ Loss of future earnings of injured (Rs.5,000/­ x 12 = 60,000/­ X 18 =Rs,10,80,000/­ divided by 85% = Rs.9,18,000/­ )Rs. 9,18,000/­ Non­Pecuniary damages – a] Loss for pains & sufferings Rs. 1,00,000/­ b] Loss of marriage prospects Rs. 1,00,000/­ c]Loss of amenities Rs. 1,00,000/­ d] Special diet Rs. 50,000/­ e] Conveyance Rs. 50,000/­ TOTAL Rs.19,60,363/­ 31]Petitioner has claimed interest @ 18%. But grant of future interest, is the discretion of the tribunal. Considering the nature of the claim, it would just and proper to grant interest @ 8% per annum, from the date of petition, till realization of 11 MACP No.131-16-Judgment entire amount. Accordingly, I answer issue No.2 partly in the affirmative. 32]Learned advocate for the opponent submitted that, Anthoni PW1 admitted about receipt of Rs.4,50,000/­ as advance from Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation. Hence, this amount should be deducted from final figure of compensation. 33]It is an admitted fact that, Anthoni PW1 is employee of Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation. He admitted about receipt of Rs.2.25 lacs on two occasions, as advance from his employer. But he further testified that, he has to repay this advance amount. It be noted that all the original medical bills of the treatment of injured Alpha, are produced before me. In such circumstances, I am of the view that, it will not be just and proper to deduct the aforesaid amount from final compensation. The opponent has to adduce cogent evidence, to show that, the aforesaid advance amount is not refundable and the petitioner had already received it. In absence of such evidence, the aforesaid amount cannot be deducted. 34]Thus the petitioner is entitled for Rs.19,60,363/­ as compensation from opponent, alongwith interest at the rate of 8% p.a. Considering the age, disability of injured Alpha, an amount of Rs.10,00,000/­, needs to be placed in fixed deposit, for a period of three years. This is in the interest of injured Alpha and to secure her future, on attaining age of majority. 12 35] Hence, petition is partly allowed as under : O R D E R 1]The petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs. 2]Opponent is hereby directed to pay compensation of Rs.19,60,363/­ (Rupees Nineteen Lacs, Sixty Thousands, Three Hundred and Sixty­Three only) along with interest @ 8% per annum, from the date of petition, till realization of entire amount to the petitioners. a] Out of the total compensation of Rs.19,60,363/­ (Rupees Nineteen Lacs, Sixty Thousands, Three Hundred and Sixty­Three only), an amount of Rs.10,00,000/­ (Rupees Ten Lacs only) be deposited in fixed deposit, for a period of three years in the name of petitioner Alpha, by issuing separate account payee cheque in her name of any nationalized bank. b] The balance amount of Rs.9,60,363/­ (Rs. Nine Lacs, Sixty Thousands, Three Hundred and Sixty­Three only) be paid to the petitioner Alpha, by issuing separate account payee cheque in her name. 3]Award be drawn accordingly.

The offending vehicle is insured with opponent No.3- The National Insurance Company Ltd. The accident took place due to rash and negligent act of opponent No.1. The said vehicle was owned by opponent No.2 and insured with opponent No.3, therefore, opponent Nos. 1 to 3 are vicariously liable to pay the compensation to the applicants. 3 MACP No.697/2015 Exh. 4.Applicant No.1- Sanjivani is wife of the deceased applicant and applicant No.2 – Rohini is his daughter.

The applicants also examined Sunita Vasant Madhe (AW2) vide exh. 29 to prove salary certificate and leave account of the deceased. No evidence was led by opponent No.3 in defence. 8.Heard Shri Sankpal, learned Counsel for the applicants and Shri Datar, learned Counsel for opponent No.3. 4 MACP No.697/2015 Exh. 9.My learned predecessor has framed the issues vide exh.12 on 04.03.2017. After hearing submissions of both the parties, I record my findings on the issues for the reasons given below. S.No. Issues Findings 1Whether the accident dated 06.02.2012 at about 11.00 a.m. on Nagar - Pune road, near Petrol pump, Navhara Phata, Shirur, Pune, took place due to rash and negligent driving of Swift Car bearing RTO registration No. MH-12-FK-4257 owned by opponent No.2, causing death of Chandrakant Patilbua Sarode ? Yes 2Whether opponents No.3 proved that the accident caused due to sole negligence of the deceased ? No 3Whether opponents No.3 proved that driver of the offending vehicle was not holding valid and effective driving licence at the time of the accident ? No 4Whether the applicants are entitled to get compensation ? If yes, to what extent and from whom ? Yes, As per final order 5What order ? As per final order. R E A S O N S As to Issue Nos.1 and 2 : 10. It is the case of the applicants that on 06.02.2012 at about 11.00a.m. on Nagar-Pune road, the deceased was proceeding on the motor-cycle alongwith his cousin Balu, as a pillion rider. At that time, opponent No.1 drove his car in rash and negligent manner and dashed to the motor-cycle of the deceased from backside and caused grievous injuries on his head and later on he died. 5 MACP No.697/2015 Exh. 11.It is the case of opponent No.3 that the accident took place due to negligence of the deceased. In order to prove the case, opponent No.3 has not led any evidence to discharge the said burden. On the contrary, it is found that the offending vehicle gave dash to the motor-cycle from backside. Therefore, car driver was negligent. Criminal case has been filed against car driver. All these facts clearly shows that the accident has not taken place due to sole negligence of the deceased. The documentary and oral evidence clearly shows that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the car driver. Hence, I record my findings on issue No.1 in Affirmative and on issue No.2 in the Negative. As to Issue No.3 : 12.Opponent No.3 came with the case that driver of the offending vehicle was not holding valid driving licence, therefore, there is breach of terms and conditions of the Insurance Policy. Therefore, opponent No.3 is not liable to pay the compensation. In order to prove the case, opponent No.3 has not led any evidence. Burden is solely upon opponent No.3. Opponent No.3 failed to prove that driver of the offending vehicle was not holding valid and effective driving licence, at the time of the accident. Therefore, I record my findings on issue No.3 in the Negative. As to issue Nos. 4 and 5 : 13.I have already held that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle. Opponent No.1 is driver and opponent No.2 is owner of the offending vehicle. Opponent No.3 is the Insurance Company, with whom the offending vehicle was insured at the time of the accident. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle, therefore, opponent Nos. 1 to 3 are jointly or 6 MACP No.697/2015 Exh. severally liable to pay compensation to the applicants. The applicants are totally depending upon the deceased, therefore, they are entitled to compensation under Section 166 of the MV Act. 14.So far as quantum of compensation is concern, it is admitted position that the deceased was working as a driver in ST Department and at the time of the accident he was working. Due to the accident, he sustained loss of salary of Rs. 1,47,651/-. In order to prove it, witness Sunita Vasant Madhe (AW2) is examined vide exh. 29 and proved the same. The applicants have filed hospital bills to the tune of Rs. 2 lakhs. Rs. 2 lakhs were towards hospital bills and medical expenses. Documentary evidence filed on record clearly support the above contention. In order to prove medical bills and receipts, the applicants have not examined any witness, but the applicants have relied on following two case laws. 1] Dr. Dattatraya Laxman Shinde V/s. Nana Raghunath Hire and others, 2013 ACJ 474. 2] Rekha Jain V/s. National Insurance Company Ltd. 2013 ACJ SC 2161. 15.In the above two case laws, it is made clear that even witnesses are not examined, still medical bills can be considered for awarding compensation. Hence, the applicants are entitled for Rs. 2 lakhs towards hospital bills and medical expenses. The applicants are entitled for Rs. 35,000/- towards Pain and sufferings; Rs. 20,000/- for diet, etc. The applicants are also entitled for Rs. 25,000/- for attendance and nursing of the deceased during his lifetime. The applicants are also entitled for Rs. 25,000/- towards travelling expenses and conveyance. Thus, the applicants are entitled to Rs. 4,52,651/-. The applicants have 7 MACP No.697/2015 Exh. proved their case, therefore, they are entitled to compensation to the tune of Rs. 4,52,651/- alongwith interest at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of application i.e. 23.11.2015, till payment of the entire amount in Tribunal, from opponent Nos. 1 to 3 jointly or severally. Hence, I answer issue Nos. 4 and 5 accordingly and proceed to pass the following order : ORDER 1.The application is partly allowed with costs. 2.The applicants are entitled to get compensation of Rs. 4,52,651/- inclusive of no fault liability. 3.Opponent Nos. 1 to 3 jointly or severally, do pay Rs. 4,52,651/-, inclusive of no fault liability, to the applicants alongwith interest at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of application i.e. 23.11.2015, till payment of the entire amount in Tribunal. 4.Opponent Nos. 1 to 3, do pay proportionate costs of the application to the applicants and shall bear his own costs. 5.

He was 49 years of old, working as a Welder in Om Fabrication Works at Ambegaon. He was getting salary of Rs.16,000/­. He died in a vehicular accident on 06/09/2014 at about 12.05 a.m.. Applicants were dependents on him. 3.On 06/09/2014 at about 12­05 a.m., he was going to give the answer of natural call. He had to cross the road. He was standing on the footpath of the road. There is traffic on the road. At that time, one Pulsar motorcycle bearing registration No.MH/45/M/8046 (hereafter referred as ''the offending motorcycle'') came from Kothrud side in a very high and excessive speed and also very rash and negligent manner. Therefore, motorcycle rider could not control over the motorcycle and gave reckless dash to the deceased­Shivaji. Dash was so severe. Deceased­Shivaji was sustained grievous and multiple injuries to his head and all over the body. He was admitted to Sahyadri hospital, Karve road, Pune. Deceased­Shivaji was declared dead. Applicants have incurred Rs.45,000/­ towards hospitalization and medical charges and also Rs.1,000/­ towards Ambulance charges. 4.Police P. S. Kothrud took the cognizance and registered 3 MACP No.31/2015 Crime No.460/2014 under section 279, 304­A , 427 of the Indian Penal Code and u/s. 184 of the Motor Vehicles Act against the offending motorcycle rider i.e. opponent No.1­ Kunal R. Bodane. It is stated that opponent No.2 was registered owner of offending motorcycle and therefore, both opponents are jointly and severally liable to pay just and reasonable compensation to applicants. With this, it is requested to allow the application. 5.Opponent Nos. 1 filed his written statement below Exh.14. Opponent No.2 though appeared through appeared Shri. Washimbekar, Advocate, but failed to file written statement. Therefore, claim application is proceeded without written statement against him. Order to that extent is passed below Exh.1 dated 23/06/2016. Latter on opponent No.2 filed pursis Exh.34 dated 10/10/2016 stating therein that written statement of opponent No.1 may be read as a written statement of opponent No.1 also. 6.In short, it is the defence of opponents that the opponent No.1 was driving the offending motorcycle. Opponent No.2 was registered owner of offending motorcycle. Motorcycle was in a moderate speed. It is stated that at the point of accident, there is one stationery tanker at the side of the road. It is stated that at the time of accident, the deceased­Shivaji came out of suddenly from front side of the said tanker and dashed to the motorcycle. It is repeatedly stated that accident occurred because of negligency on the part of deceased­ Shivaji. In addition to this, it is also the defence of opponents that deceased was under influence of liquor, due to which, he lost his control and dashed to the offending motorcycle thereby sustained injuries and succumbed to the injuries. It is also contended that the opponent No.1 has also sustained injuries in the accident. He was 4 MACP No.31/2015 hospitalized. He has incurred more than Rs. 2 lakh towards his medical expenses. It is stated that Police P. S. Kothrud wrongly registered the crime No.460/2014 against opponent No.1. It is denied that deceased­Shivaji was 49 years old. He was doing job as a Welder in OM Fabrication Works, Ambegaon (Bk). It is also denied that his monthly income was Rs. 16,000/­. It is also denied that applicants were dependents on him. However, it is admitted that at the relevant time of accident, opponent No.1 was riding the offending motorcycle and opponent No.2 was registered owner of the said motorcycle. With this , it requested to dismiss the claim application. 7.On the rival contentions of the parties, Issues are framed at Exh.17. Those are reproduced below with my findings against each of them, for the reasons to follows­ Sr. No.Issues Findings 1 Do the applicants prove that deceased ­ Shivaji Rambhau Tamkar died in the motor vehicular accident, caused on 06/09/2014 at about 12­ 05 a.m., on Paud road near Lokmanya colony Zopadpatti, Kothrud, Pune by rash and negligent driving of Pulsar motorcycle bearing registration No.MH/45/M/8046? Yes 2 Whether applicants are entitled to compensation, If yes, a) from whom and b) to what amount?As per final order 3 What order and Award? As per final order R E A S O N S 8. In order to prove their case, applicants have examined applicant No.1­ Rekha S. Tamkar as AW­1 below Exh.18, AW­2­Datta 5 MACP No.31/2015 Sudam Bendre below Exh.27 and closed the evidence vide pursis (Exh.29). As against this, opponents have examined Opponent No.1­ Kunal R. Bodane as OW­1 below Exh.30 and closed the evidence vide pursis below Exh.33. Apart from oral evidence, applicants have relied on the police papers of Crime no.460/2014 of Police Station Kothrud such as FIR (Exh.19), complaint (Exh.20), spot panchanama (Exh.21), Postmortem report (Exh.22), Inquest panchanama (Exh.23), Accident report form (Exh.24) and Salary certificate of deceased­ Shivaji (Exh.28). 9. Admitted facts of the case ­ It is admitted fact that deceased­Shivaji died in a vehicular accident dated 06/09/2014. Applicants are his legal heirs. Immediately after the accident, police P. S. Kothrud registered Crime No.460/2014 under section 279, 304­A of the Indian Penal Code and u/s. 184 of the Motor Vehicles Act against the opponent No.1. Opponent No.1 was riding the offending motorcycle and opponent No.2 was its registered owner. 10.As to Issue No. 1:­ AW­1 is widow of deceased­Shivaji. AW­1 categorically deposed that on 06/09/2014, her husband was going to give the answer of natural call. He was to cross the public road. He was standing on the side road i.e. on kachha road. At that time moment, offending motorcycle came from Kothrud side in a high and excessive speed. Opponent No.1 was driving the said motorcycle. He was driving the offending motorcycle so rashly and negligently and gave dash to the deceased­Shivaji. Deceased sustained injuries. Deceased was shifted to Sahyadri hospital, Karve road, Pune, where he expired. Evidence of AW­1­ Rekha is consonance with the pleading. During course of cross­examination, she admitted that she has not 6 MACP No.31/2015 seen the accident and therefore, unable to say, who was responsible for the accident. At the the same time, she categorically deposed that accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of offending motorcycle rider. I do admit with the legal position that the applicant being a hearsay witness, much importance cannot be given to her evidence. In this circumstance, it would be proper to assess alleged rash and negligent driving of offending motorcycle rider on the basis of police papers. On this point, I am relying on the Judgment of Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of Oriental Insurance Co.Ltd. Vs. Babulal Chunilal Somani (2015(1) MH. L. J. 71) , in which, it is held that '' in the absence of any direct evidence regarding manner and details of accident, reliance can be placed on contents of certified copy of FIR and panchanama spot of occurrence. On going through the police papers of Crime No.460/2014 especially the spot panchanama, it has come to my notice that accident occurred adjacent to the footpath i.e, kaccha road. Further, it has also come to my notice that tanker was not parked at the side of the road. Therefore,theory of opponents that deceased­Shivaji suddenly came behind the truck and dashed to the offending motorcycle cannot be accepted. It is an admitted position that police P. S. Kothrud visited the place of occurrence, registered Crime No.460/2014 against the offending motorcycle, but the offending motorcycle rider did not raise his grievance, if any, against the registration of crime. Which speaks volume. 11.Opponents have examined offending motorcycle rider i.e. opponent No.1 as OW.1. He deposed that all of sudden, deceased­ Shivaji came out from the side of truck and dashed to offending motorcycle. But, I have already observed that there is no evidence 7 MACP No.31/2015 that the truck was parked at the side of the road. Absolutely there is no reference in the police papers especially in the spot panchanama about alleged truck. Therefore, I am not satisfied with the evidence of opponent No.1. Though it is the defence of opponents that deceased was under the influence of alchohol and therefore, he could not control his balance and dashed to the motorcycle, but the opponent No.1 did not depose single word in this regard. I hold that the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of offending motorcycle rider. I, therefore, answer Issue No.1 in the affirmative. 12.As to Issue Nos. 2 and 3:­ Compensation under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act is based on age, income and occupation of deceased. It has been stated by AW­1 that deceased­ Shivaji was aged about 49 years old on the date of accident. Applicants have not filed age proof of deceased­Shivaji. In this circumstances, I have to determine the age of deceased­Shivaji on police papers, especially on the Postmortem report. Age of deceased­Shivaji is cited as 65 years in Postmortem report (Exh.22), Inquest panchanama (Exh.23). Both the documents have been filed by applicants and the documents have not been denied by the opponents. Therefore, I hold that deceased ­Shivaji was 65 years of age on the date of accident. Therefore, multiplier applicable to the age group of 61 to 65 is 7. 13.So far as income of deceased­Shivaji is concerned, it is stated by AW­1 that deceased­Shivaji was Welder and doing job in OM Fabrication Works, Ambegaon (BK) and was getting salary of Rs.16,000/­ per month. To prove the income of deceased­Shivaji, applicants have examined AW­2­ Datta Bendre, proprietor of Om Fabrication Works. He deposed that deceased was doing job in his company since 2010 and monthly salary of deceased­Shivaji was 8 MACP No.31/2015 Rs.16,000/­. However, AW­2 has not filed Attendance Register, vouchers, Payment receipts etc. to show that salary of deceased­ Shivaji was Rs.16,000/­ per month. Considering the age of deceased­ Shivaji, nature of work, his family etc. I am of the view that deceased being skilled labour must have earned Rs.6,000/­ per month and yearly income comes to Rs.72,000/­. Applicant No.1 is widow, applicant Nos. 2 and 3 are the major sons of deceased. Considering their ages, family back ground, I am of the view that the applicants were the dependents on the income of deceased­Shivaji. Considering number of dependents, 1/3rd amount is required to be deducted towards living and personal expenses of deceased from Rs.72,000/­. After deducting 1/3rd amount towards living and personal expenses of the deceased, yearly dependency of applicants on the income of deceased comes to Rs.48000/­. By applying multiplier 07 to the yearly dependency of Rs.48000/­, total loss of dependency of the applicants, on the income of deceased come to Rs.3,36,000/­. In addition to this, applicant No.1 being widow is entitled to get compensation of Rs.1,00,000/­ towards Loss of Consortium, applicants are also entitled to get Rs.25,000/­ towards Funeral Expenses and Rs.1,00,000/­ towards loss of Love and Affection as observed by Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Rajesh and others Vs. Rajbir Singh and others ( 2013 ACJ 1403). As such, applicants are entitled to total compensation of Rs.5,61,000/­ along with interest @ of 9% per annum (inclusive of interim compensation awarded under section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act) from opponent Nos.1 and 2. Opponent Nos.1 and 2 are jointly and severally responsible for the payment of compensation. 14.It is has been argued on behalf of applicants that 9 MACP No.31/2015 immediately after the accident, deceased­Shivaji was admitted to Sahyadri hospital, Pune. Deceased expired on the same day at about 1­30 a.m. Applicants have incurred Rs.40,000/­ towards hospitalization and medical charges. It is also submitted that Opponents have incurred Rs.1,000/­ towards Ambulance charges. Applicants have not filed any documents in this regard. Applicants have come with the specific case that they borne the medical expenses of the deceased­Shivaji and Rs.60,000/­ was paid by them. Evidence of opponent No.1 is also on the same line and the applicants did not deny the said fact. This apart the original hospitalization medical bills worth Rs. 56,084/­ are in the name of deceased­Shivaji but produced by opponent No.1. Production of original hospitalization and medical bills from the custody of opponent No.1 speaks volume and support the defence. Therefore, I am of the view that Rs.56,084/­ was paid by opponents towards hospitalization and medical bills of deceased­ Shivaji. With this, I hold that the applicants are not entitled to compensation under the head of hospitalization and medical bills. I, therefore answer Issue No.2 accordingly and in response to Issue No.3, I pass following order. Order 1.The application is partly allowed with proportionate costs. 2.Opponent No.1 and 2 are directed to pay jointly and severally compensation of Rs.5,61,000/­ (Rs.Five lakh sixty­one thousand only) (including interim compensation awarded u/s.140 of the Motor Vehicles Act), along with cost and interest @ 9% per annum, from the date of petition, till realization of entire amount to the applicant No.1­ Smt. Rekha Shivaji Tamkar, applicant No.2 ­ 10 MACP No.31/2015 Kumar Amol Shivaji Tamkar and applicant No.3­ Kumar Gokul Shivaji Tamkar, in following proportion­ a)Out of total compensation, 40% compensation be paid to the applicant No.1 and 30% compensation be paid to each applicant Nos. 2 and 3. b)Out of compensation payable to applicant Nos. 1 to 3, amount of Rs.50,000/­ (Rs. Fifty only) be invested in Fixed deposits in the names of each applicant Nos. 1 to 3 in any nationalized bank of their choice for a period of three years, and balance amount be paid to them by issuing separate account payee cheques after due identification and verification. 3.Award be drawn up accordingly.

Shri R R Ganu - Advocate for opponent No.2 JUDGMENT (Decided on 11.10.2017 ) This Petition has been preferred under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act (“ the MV Act” for short). The applicants are the unfortunate dependents of Pankaj Pancham Pardeshi (hereinafter referred to as “the deceased”), who lost his life in a vehicular accident occurred on 05.07.2015. 2. It is the case of the petitioners that on 05.07.2015 at about 12.45 p.m. the accident occurred. At that time the deceased was proceeding from Ambey Valley, on his motor-cycle bearing No. MH-12-DC-7975. His other friends were alongwith him, on their independent motor-cycles. The deceased was driving his motor- cycle in moderate speed and towards correct side of the road. When the deceased came in Atvan village, at that time, Mahindra XUV bearing No. MH-14-CX-8842 ( hereinafter referred to as “ the offending vehicle”) was proceeding from opposite side, in excessive speed from wrong side of the road and it violently dashed to the motor-cycle of the deceased, in which the deceased was thrown away to the corner of the road and sustained head injury with multiple fractures. The deceased was taken to INS hospital, where doctor declared him dead. The offending vehicle is owned by opponent No.1 and opponent No.2 is the insurer with whom the said offending vehicle is insured. Therefore, both of them are liable to pay compensation. The petitioners are dependent upon the deceased, therefore, they are entitled to compensation under Section 166 of the MV Act. Hence, this petition. 3.It is further contention of the petitioners that the 3 MACP No. 557/2015 Exh. deceased was 28 years old bachelor and working in Wipro Limtied as a Senior Associate and earning Rs. 16,059/- per month. It is further their contention that Lonavala (R) Police Station registered the offence under Sections 279, 337, 338, 304(A), 427 of the IPC and under the Motor Vehicles Act, vide CR No. 102/2015. Therefore, the petitioners prayed for compensation under Section 166 of the MV Act. Hence, this application. 4.Respondent No.1 though served with summons, failed to appeared, therefore, claim proceeded exparte against him. Respondent No.2 – Insurance Company appeared and filed its written statement vide exh.13 and denied all the allegations made by the petitioners. Respondent No.2 has contended that driver of the offending vehicle was not holding valid licence and the accident is not taken place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the deceased. Therefore, opponent No.2 is not liable to pay compensation and finally prayed for dismissal of the petition with costs. 5. The issues framed at exh.14 on 16.09.2016. After submissions of both the parties, I have recorded my findings on the issues as under for the reasons given below : S.No. Issues Findings 1Whether the accident dated 05.07.2015 at about 12.45 p.m. on Lonavala – Ambey valley road, in the vicinity of Atvan village, near Shivling point, took place due to rash and negligent driving of Mahindra XUV 500 bearing RTO registration No. MH-14- CX-8842 owned by opponent No.1, causing death of Pankaj Pancham Pardeshi ?

If yes, to what extent and from whom ?Yes, Rs. 13,62,080/- from respondent Nos. 1 and 2 jointly or severally. 4What award ? As per final order. R E A S O N S As to issue Nos. 1 and 2 : 6.It is the case of the petitioners that deceased Pankaj Pancham Pardeshi died in the accident took place between motor- cycle of the deceased and the offending vehicle. At the time of the accident, the deceased was proceeding on motor-cycle in moderate speed and from correct side of the road. The offending vehicle came from opposite side in rash and negligent manner, in high speed and also by coming wrong side and gave dash to the motor- cycle of the deceased and due to the said dash, the deceased died when he was taken to hospital. 7.In order to prove rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle, police papers like panchanama, FIR, etc; were filed on record. The petitioners examined Petitioner No.2 in support of the case. She has deposed about the accident. The evidence of petitioner No.2 and other documents are sufficient to prove that the incident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle. Medical evidence shows that the deceased died due to accident. Thus, the petitioners have proved that the incident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle. Therefore, I record my findings on issue No.1 in the Affirmative. 5 MACP No. 557/2015 Exh. Issue No.2 : 8.Opponent No.1- Insurance company, came with the case that the driver of the offending vehicle is not holding valid licence, therefore, there is breach of agreement. Thus, burden is on opponent No.2. Opponent No.2 has not led evidence to show that the driver of the offending vehicle was not holding valid licence. Opponent No.2 has failed to prove this issue, therefore, I record my findings on issue No.2 in the Negative. Issue Nos. 3 and 4 : 9.In this case, the petitioners have proved that the deceased died due to injuries caused to him in a vehicular accident, which took place on 05 .07.2015, in which the offending vehicle was involved, owned by respondent No.1. The petitioners are the dependents of the deceased, therefore, they are entitled to compensation under Section 166 of the MV Act. 10.So far as quantum of compensation is concern, it is the case of the petitioners that the deceased was aged about 28 years at the time of the accident. The deceased was bachelor, therefore, his age cannot be consider while considering multiplier. 11.The following case laws are filed by the petitioners : 1] Sarala Varma and others V/s. Delhi Transport Corporation and another 2009 ACJ 1298 ( Supreme Court). 2] Amrit Bhanushali and others V/s. National Insurance Co. ltd; 2012 ACJ, 2002 SC. 3] Munnalal Jain and others V/s.

Rajbir Singh and others, 2014 (1) Mh.L.J.79. 12.The following case laws are filed on behalf of opponent No.2 : 1] Indumati P . Gaikwad V/s. National Insurance Co. Ltd; in First Appeal No. 962/2016. 2] Meena and others V/s. Rani Ammal and another, Special Leave to Appeal No.34648/2015. 3] Kempaiah and others V/s. S. S. Murti and others, 2017 ACJ 1722. 4] United India Ins. Co. V/s. Sobha Rajput and otehrs, 2017 CLI 422. 5] United India Ins. Co. V/s. Smt. Naseembee Kattimiya and others, 2017 CLU 452. 13. In one case, it is stated that average age of the parents should be considered and in another case age of the deceased is to be considered. But when the deceased died as a bachelor, then average age of the petitioners can be considered. Age of petitioner No.1 is 76 years and petitioner No.2 is 66 years and ages of petitioner Nos. 3 and 4 are 23 and 21 years respectively. Average of all the ages of petitioners came to be 46.50. Therefore, multiplier of '13' is applicable to this case. 7 MACP No. 557/2015 Exh. 14.In this case, according to the petitioners, the deceased was working in Wipro Limited, as a Senior Associate and earning Rs. 16,059/- per month. Amount of Rs. 200/- per month deducted towards profession tax, therefore, monthly income comes to Rs. 15,859/- per month, which is rounded off to Rs. 15,860/-. The deceased was bachelor at the time of the accident, therefore, 50% amount is to be deducted towards his personal expenses. Therefore, monthly income of the deceased comes to (15,860/- - 7,930/-) = Rs. 7,930/-. Hence, annual income of the deceases comes to Rs. 95,160/- ( Rs. 7,930/- x 12). 15.As held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in cases of Santosh Devi Vs. National Insurance Co . and Rajesh Vs. Rajbir Singh, the applicants are also entitled for future prospect of 40% of his income. Therefore, I consider future prospects of the deceased to the tune of Rs. 3 8,064/- per annum. So annual income of the deceased comes to Rs. 1,33,224 /-. 16. Considering the ratio laid down in the case of Sarala Varma and others V/s. Delhi Transport Corporation and another 2009 ACJ 1298 ( Supreme Court) and facts of the present case, multiplier of '13' can be applied. By applying multiplier of '13', loss of income comes to (Rs. 1,33,224 x 13) Rs. 17,31,912/- towards loss of dependency. 17.The petitioners are also entitled to Rs. 1,00,000/- towards loss of love and affection and Rs. 25,000/- towards funeral expenses. 18.Thus, the petitioners are entitled for total compensation of Rs. 18,56,912/- alongwith interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum 8 MACP No. 557/2015 Exh. from the date of filing of the application i.e. 08.09.2015, from respondent No.1 – owner and respondent No.2- Insurer of the offending vehicle jointly or severally. Accordingly, I answer issue Nos. 3 and 4 and proceed to pass following order : ORDER 1.The petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs. 2.The Petitioners are entitled to get compensation of Rs. 18,56,912/-, inclusive of no fault liability. 3.Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 do pay Rs. 18,56,912/- , inclusive of no fault liability, jointly or severally, to the Petitioners with interest at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of application i.e. 08.09.2015 till payment of the entire amount in Tribunal. 4.Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 do pay cost of the Petition to the petitioners and shall bear their own costs. 5.On payment of the above mentioned amount in the Court, the same be disbursed amongst the petitioners equally alongwith interest and costs. 6. Out of the amount payable to Petitioners, half of the amounts be invested in the fixed deposit in their respective names for a period of 36 months in any Nationalized Bank. Rest of the amounts be paid to them by Crossed Account payee cheques drawn on any Nationalized Bank. 9.The Petitioners would be at liberty to withdraw the amounts of interest accrued on their fixed deposit amount monthly, if they desire so.

The deceased was bachelor, therefore, his age cannot be consider while considering multiplier. 11.The following case laws are filed by the petitioners : 1] Sarala Varma and others V/s.

In one case, it is stated that average age of the parents should be considered and in another case age of the deceased is to be considered. But when the deceased died as a bachelor, then average age of the petitioners can be considered. Age of petitioner No.1 is 76 years and petitioner No.2 is 66 years and ages of petitioner Nos. 3 and 4 are 23 and 21 years respectively. Average of all the ages of petitioners came to be 46.50. Therefore, multiplier of '13' is applicable to this case. 7 MACP No. 557/2015 Exh. 14.In this case, according to the petitioners, the deceased was working in Wipro Limited, as a Senior Associate and earning Rs. 16,059/- per month. Amount of Rs. 200/- per month deducted towards profession tax, therefore, monthly income comes to Rs. 15,859/- per month, which is rounded off to Rs. 15,860/-. The deceased was bachelor at the time of the accident, therefore, 50% amount is to be deducted towards his personal expenses. Therefore, monthly income of the deceased comes to (15,860/- - 7,930/-) = Rs. 7,930/-. Hence, annual income of the deceases comes to Rs. 95,160/- ( Rs. 7,930/- x 12). 15.As held by the Hon'ble Apex Court in cases of Santosh Devi Vs. National Insurance Co . and Rajesh Vs. Rajbir Singh, the applicants are also entitled for future prospect of 40% of his income. Therefore, I consider future prospects of the deceased to the tune of Rs. 3 8,064/- per annum. So annual income of the deceased comes to Rs. 1,33,224 /-. 16. Considering the ratio laid down in the case of Sarala Varma and others V/s. Delhi Transport Corporation and another 2009 ACJ 1298 ( Supreme Court) and facts of the present case, multiplier of '13' can be applied. By applying multiplier of '13', loss of income comes to (Rs. 1,33,224 x 13) Rs. 17,31,912/- towards loss of dependency. 17.The petitioners are also entitled to Rs. 1,00,000/- towards loss of love and affection and Rs. 25,000/- towards funeral expenses. 18.Thus, the petitioners are entitled for total compensation of Rs. 18,56,912/- alongwith interest at the rate of 7.5% per annum 8 MACP No. 557/2015 Exh. from the date of filing of the application i.e. 08.09.2015, from respondent No.1 – owner and respondent No.2- Insurer of the offending vehicle jointly or severally. Accordingly, I answer issue Nos. 3 and 4 and proceed to pass following order : ORDER 1.The petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs. 2.The Petitioners are entitled to get compensation of Rs. 18,56,912/-, inclusive of no fault liability. 3.Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 do pay Rs. 18,56,912/- , inclusive of no fault liability, jointly or severally, to the Petitioners with interest at the rate of 7.5 % per annum from the date of application i.e. 08.09.2015 till payment of the entire amount in Tribunal. 4.Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 do pay cost of the Petition to the petitioners and shall bear their own costs. 5.On payment of the above mentioned amount in the Court, the same be disbursed amongst the petitioners equally alongwith interest and costs. 6.

The applicants are the unfortunate dependents of Pankaj Pancham Pardeshi (hereinafter referred to as “the deceased”), who lost his life in a vehicular accident occurred on 05.07.2015. 2. It is the case of the petitioners that on 05.07.2015 at about 12.45 p.m. the accident occurred. At that time the deceased was proceeding from Ambey Valley, on his motor-cycle bearing No. MH-12-DC-7975. His other friends were alongwith him, on their independent motor-cycles. The deceased was driving his motor- cycle in moderate speed and towards correct side of the road. When the deceased came in Atvan village, at that time, Mahindra XUV bearing No. MH-14-CX-8842 ( hereinafter referred to as “ the offending vehicle”) was proceeding from opposite side, in excessive speed from wrong side of the road and it violently dashed to the motor-cycle of the deceased, in which the deceased was thrown away to the corner of the road and sustained head injury with multiple fractures. The deceased was taken to INS hospital, where doctor declared him dead. The offending vehicle is owned by opponent No.1 and opponent No.2 is the insurer with whom the said offending vehicle is insured. Therefore, both of them are liable to pay compensation. The petitioners are dependent upon the deceased, therefore, they are entitled to compensation under Section 166 of the MV Act. Hence, this petition. 3.It is further contention of the petitioners that the 3 MACP No. 557/2015 Exh. deceased was 28 years old bachelor and working in Wipro Limtied as a Senior Associate and earning Rs. 16,059/- per month. It is further their contention that Lonavala (R) Police Station registered the offence under Sections 279, 337, 338, 304(A), 427 of the IPC and under the Motor Vehicles Act, vide CR No. 102/2015. Therefore, the petitioners prayed for compensation under Section 166 of the MV Act. Hence, this application. 4.Respondent No.1 though served with summons, failed to appeared, therefore, claim proceeded exparte against him. Respondent No.2 – Insurance Company appeared and filed its written statement vide exh.13 and denied all the allegations made by the petitioners. Respondent No.2 has contended that driver of the offending vehicle was not holding valid licence and the accident is not taken place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the deceased. Therefore, opponent No.2 is not liable to pay compensation and finally prayed for dismissal of the petition with costs. 5. The issues framed at exh.14 on 16.09.2016. After submissions of both the parties, I have recorded my findings on the issues as under for the reasons given below : S.No. Issues Findings 1Whether the accident dated 05.07.2015 at about 12.45 p.m. on Lonavala – Ambey valley road, in the vicinity of Atvan village, near Shivling point, took place due to rash and negligent driving of Mahindra XUV 500 bearing RTO registration No. MH-14- CX-8842 owned by opponent No.1, causing death of Pankaj Pancham Pardeshi ?

R E A S O N S As to issue Nos. 1 and 2 : 6.It is the case of the petitioners that deceased Pankaj Pancham Pardeshi died in the accident took place between motor- cycle of the deceased and the offending vehicle. At the time of the accident, the deceased was proceeding on motor-cycle in moderate speed and from correct side of the road. The offending vehicle came from opposite side in rash and negligent manner, in high speed and also by coming wrong side and gave dash to the motor- cycle of the deceased and due to the said dash, the deceased died when he was taken to hospital. 7.In order to prove rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle, police papers like panchanama, FIR, etc; were filed on record. The petitioners examined Petitioner No.2 in support of the case. She has deposed about the accident. The evidence of petitioner No.2 and other documents are sufficient to prove that the incident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle. Medical evidence shows that the deceased died due to accident. Thus, the petitioners have proved that the incident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle. Therefore, I record my findings on issue No.1 in the Affirmative. 5 MACP No. 557/2015 Exh. Issue No.2 : 8.Opponent No.1- Insurance company, came with the case that the driver of the offending vehicle is not holding valid licence, therefore, there is breach of agreement. Thus, burden is on opponent No.2. Opponent No.2 has not led evidence to show that the driver of the offending vehicle was not holding valid licence. Opponent No.2 has failed to prove this issue, therefore, I record my findings on issue No.2 in the Negative. Issue Nos. 3 and 4 : 9.In this case, the petitioners have proved that the deceased died due to injuries caused to him in a vehicular accident, which took place on 05 .07.2015, in which the offending vehicle was involved, owned by respondent No.1.

J U D G M E N T (Delivered on this 18 th day of February , 2017). [1]The applicants have claimed compensation under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act (In short '' M.V. Act'') , on account of accidental death of Mahadeo Dhondiba Ghume, due to the vehicular accident which occurred on 25.08.2014. [2]In brief, facts of the applicant's case , are as under :­­ On 25.08.2014 at about 13.30 hours deceased Mahadeo Ghume met with an accident near Maharashtra Mens Parlor and Shri Old Kal Bhairav Mandir, Kasba peth, Pune, with auto rickshaw bearing registration No. MH­12/FZ­6649 in which deceased Mahadeo Ghume sustained severe injuries including head injury. He died on the same day in the hospital due to the head injury. At the time of the accident, the offending vehicle viz. Auto rickshaw bearing registration No. MH­ 12/FZ­6649 was driven by opponent No. 1 in a rash and negligent manner so also in a high and excessive speed and without following vehicular traffic rules. 3 MACP 307-15 jud [3]At the time of the accident, offending auto rickshaw bearing registration No. MH­12/FZ­6649 was owned by opponent No. 2 and insured with opponent No. 3. [4]Applicant Nos. 1 and 2 are married daughters of deceased Mahadeo Ghume and applicant No. 3 and opponent No. 4 are the married sons of deceased Mahadeo . Applicant No. 1 is divorced by her husband and she was depending upon her father i.e. deceased Mahadeo. [5]The applicants contended that the accident occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the offending auto rickshaw. The applicants contended that, at the time of the accident deceased was aged about 64 years and he was earning Rs. 5,000/­ to Rs. 6,000/­ per month by doing catering business. It is further contended by the applicants that opponent Nos. 1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation of Rs. 5 Lakhs, to the applicants. [6]Opponent No. 1 and 2 were duly served, but they failed to file their Written Statement and hence the matter proceeded ex­parte against them. [7]Opponent No. 3 filed its Written Statement vide Ex. 23 and resisted the claim. Opponent No. 3 contended that, the offending auto rickshaw was not involved in the accident. It is further contended that the driver of the offending vehicle was not holding valid and effective driving license. It is further contended that the applicants 4 MACP 307-15 jud being the married daughters of the deceased, were not depending on the deceased and therefore, they are not entitled for compensation. Lastly, it prayed for dismissal of the claim petition. [8]Opponent No. 4 filed his Written statement vide Ex. 17 and submitted that he is not depending on the income of his deceased father­ Mahadeo Ghule and hence whatever compensation would be awarded by this Court be paid to the applicants. [9]From the rival pleadings of the parties, I framed the Issues vide Ex. 24. The said issues are reproduced below along with my findings against each of them , for the reasons stated below. ISSUES FINDINGS. [1]Whether deceased Mahadeo Dhondiba Ghume died in the motor vehicular accident due to the rash and negligent driving of auto rickshaw bearing registration No. MH­12/FZ­6649? …………Yes. [2]Are applicants entitled for compensation? …Yes, as per If yes, to what extent and from whom ? … final order. [3]What order ? …………As per final order. R E A S O N S. [10]In order to prove the claim, applicant No. 1 Smt. Sunanda Ghume filed her evidence on affidavit at Ex. 26. The applicants have also brought on record certain documents including police papers, post mortem report of deceased, Accidental Report Form, R.T.O. Registration and insurance policy of the offending auto rickshaw, driving license of the driver of the offending vehicle, hospital bills of the deceased and copy of divorce decree of applicant No. 1, at Ex. 28 to 5 MACP 307-15 jud 40. [11]Opponent No. 3­ Insurance Company denied the involvement of the offending auto rickshaw in the accident. However, opponent No. 3 has not examined any witness in support of its contention. Even it failed to examine the owner and driver of the offending auto rickshaw. [12]The applicants have brought on record police papers viz. Copy of F.I.R., spot panchanama, inquest panchanama etc. The driver of the offending auto rickshaw is also prosecuted for the offence punishable under Sections 304­A, 279 of Indian Penal Code and Section 119, 177, 132(1)(c) of Motor Vehicles Act. On perusal of the police papers, it appears that the offending auto rickshaw gave dash to the deceased when he was walking by the side of the road. The offending auto rickshaw was driven by its driver in high and excessive speed so also rashly and negligently. The driver of the offending vehicle lost his control over his vehicle and the accident occurred. [13]In the oral testimony applicant No. 1 deposed that at the time of the accident the driver of the offending auto rickshaw was driving his vehicle in a high and excessive speed so also rashly and negligently, and he lost his control and thereby caused the accident by giving dash to the deceased. This witness is cross­examined by opponent No. 3, but there is no cross­examination on the point of rash and negligent driving on the part of driver of the offending auto rickshaw. Thus, I find no reason to disbelieve the testimony of applicant No. 1, which is supported by police papers. [14]Post mortem report (Ex. 32) disclose that the death of 6 MACP 307-15 jud deceased is caused due to head injury. It is very well established on record that the deceased sustained head injury in the accident. Hence , in my opinion, the applicants have succeeded in proving that deceased Mahadeo Ghume died in the motor vehicular accident due to the rash and negligent driving on the part of driver of the offending auto rickshaw. Hence, I answer Issue No. 1 in the affirmative. [15]ISSUE NO. 2 :­­ It is the defence of opponent No. 3­ Insurance Company – that the applicants being married daughters and sons of deceased, they are not dependents of the deceased and hence they are not entitled for receiving any compensation. On the other hand, it is the contention of the applicants that applicant No. 1 is divorced by her husband. In support of their contention the applicants have filed on record copy of decree of divorce of applicant No. 1 at Ex. 39. Said divorce decree is passed by the Family Court, Pune on 22.03.1990. Applicant No. 1 further stated that she being the divorcee , depending on the income of her father . Not only this, she was living with her deceased father since 1988. She was helping her father in his catering business. Applicant No. 1 further stated that though applicant No. 2 is married but her father was helping her and she was also depending on her father. The evidence of applicant No. 1 remained unchallenged. [16]The learned Advocate for applicants in order to support the claim of the applicants that the applicants being the legal heirs of deceased Mahadeo are entitled for compensation, relied upon following authorities. (1)Manjuri Bera V/s. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd., (Judgment dated 30.03.2007 in Appeal (Civil) 7 MACP 307-15 jud 1702/2007. (2)Emilya D'Silva and others V/s. B. Narayan Manden and another.( 2006 ACJ 181­ Karnataka High Court ). (3)Goutham Bafna and others V/s. J. Pramod Kumar Bansal and another. ( 2011 ACJ 1360 Madras High Court ). [17]In the case of Manjuri Bera, Cited Supra, Hon'ble Supreme Court held that, even if there is no loss of dependency, the claimant if he or she is a legal representative, will be entitled to compensation, the quantum of which shall be not less than the liability flowing from Section 140 of the Motor Vehicle Act. [18]In the case of Emilya D'Silva, cited Supra, Hon'ble Karnataka High Court held that, the widowed daughter would be covered under the definition '' unmarried daughter''. [19]In the case of Gouttham Bafna, Cited Supra, Hon'ble Madras High Court held that even if they were not dependent, there is loss to the estate and a person who is legal representative but not dependent can yet be a beneficiary of the estate. [20]Considering the legal position settled in the above cited cases, applicant No. 1 being the divorced daughter of the deceased and residing with her deceased father since 1988 , was dependent on the estate of the deceased. Therefore, she being the dependent of the deceased, is entitled for compensation. 8 MACP 307-15 jud [21]As I have already pointed out that applicant No. 1 stated that her father was helping her sister i.e. applicant No. 2, who is married daughter of the deceased and said statement of applicant No. 1 goes unchallenged. Hence, in my opinion, applicant No. 2 being the beneficiary is entitled for compensation to some extent. [22]Applicant No. 1 deposed that at the time of death, deceased was aged 64 years and was earning Rs. 5,000/­ to Rs. 6,000/­ per month by doing catering business. Evidence of the applicant remained unchallenged. Considering the nature of business, notional income of deceased can be held at Rs. 5,000/­ per month. Thus, his yearly income comes to Rs. 60,000/­. As the number of dependents are two, hence 1/3rd amount is to be deducted as per the ratio laid down in the case of Sarla Verma and others V/s. Delhi Transport Corporation and another ( A.I.R. 2009 S.C. 3104 (1)) , Hence after deducting 1/3rd amount, yearly dependency of the applicants comes to Rs. 40,000/­. Moreover, taking into consideration the age of the deceased as 64 years, proper multiplier in this case would be of 7. After multiplying by multiplier 7 to the yearly loss of dependency of Rs. 40,000/­, future loss of dependency comes to Rs. 2,80,000/­. In addition to this, the applicants are entitled for compensation of Rs. 25,000/­ under the head of '' funeral expenses'' of the deceased. [23]Applicant No. 1 stated that after the accident her father was admitted in Surya hospital, Pune and he died in the said hospital. The applicant has filed copy of medical bill at Ex. 40 which is for Rs. 15,600/­. Hence, the applicants are entitled to receive an amount of 9 MACP 307-15 jud Rs. 15,600/­ towards the medical expenses of the deceased. The applicants and opponent No. 4, being the daughters and sons of the deceased are also entitled for compensation of Rs. 15,000/­ each under the head of '' loss of love and affection.'' [24]Thus, in all the applicants are entitled for total compensation of Rs. 3,80,600/­ including N.F.L., compensation, as under. :­­ Rs. 2,80,000/­ Loss of dependency. Rs. 60,000/­ Loss of love and affection to applicants and opponent No. 4. Rs. 25,000/­ Funeral expenses of the deceased. Rs. 15,600/­ Medical expenses of the deceased. -----------------------------. Rs. 3,80,600/­ Total. =================. [25] So far as the rate of interest is concerned, taking into consideration the present bank rate on the Fixed Deposits, in my considered view, future interest at the rate of Rs. 7 % P. A. , is just and proper , which is to be applied from the date of filing of the claim application till realization of the entire compensation amount. As such, I answer Issue No. 2 , accordingly. [26]Cumulative effect of the above findings is that, the Claim Application is liable to be allowed partly with proportionate costs. Hence, I proceed to pass the following order. O R D E R [1]Claim Application is partly allowed with proportionate costs. [2]Opponent Nos. 1 to 3 shall jointly and severally pay an amount of Rs. 3,80,600/­ ( Rs. Three Lakhs, Eighty thousands, and six 10 MACP 307-15 jud hundred only) including N.F.L. Compensation, along with interest at the rate of Rs. 7 % Per Annum, from the date of filing of the Claim Application, till realization of the entire amount, to the applicants. [3]On depositing the above amount, an amount of Rs. 15,000/­ (Rs. Fifteen thousand only ) be paid to applicant No. 4 Dashrath Mahadeo Ghume, by account payee cheque in his favour , after due identification and verification. [4]Out of the remaining amount, an amount of Rs. 40,000/­ (Rs. Forty thousand only) be paid to applicant No. 3 Amol Mahadeo Ghume by account payee cheque in his favour, after due identification and verification. [5]On depositing the above amount, an amount of Rs. 75,000.­ (Rs. Seventy­ five thousand only) be paid to applicant No. 2 Mrs. Sharda Kiran Karanje, by account payee cheque in her favour, after due identification and verification. [6]Remaining amount, along with interest , be paid to applicant No. 1 Smt. Sunanda Mahado Ghumne, by Account Payee cheque in her favour after due identification and verification.

Shri.S.K.Mate, advocate for Non applicant _______________________________________________ ____________ Judgment in M.A.C.P.No.208/2015 ­2­ J U D G M E N T (Delivered on this 10th May, 2018) In this claim petition U/Sec.166 of Motor Vehicles Act, applicants have claimed compensation for the death of Roshan Bhimrao Kharat, in the motor accident. 02.Case of the applicants, in short, is as under : That on 26.4.2014, at 3.10 p.m, deceased Roshan was riding Hero Honda motorcycle bearing registration No.MH­14­BY­5332. He was coming from Kalewadi to Pimpri Camp along with Dipak Jadhav. Roshan was driving motorcycle in a very slow speed and by correct side of the road, observing all the Traffic Rules and Regulations. When the motorcycle reached to Mahalaxmi Cement Godown, Kalewadi, a PMPML bus bearing registration No.MH­12­FZ­8403 coming from back side of motorcycle dashed motor cycle. It was being driven in rash and negligent manner by its driver. Both the riders, Roshan and Dipak died on the spot. Deceased Roshan was 26 years' old at the time of accident. He was in service with First Flight Courier Ltd, Nigdi, Pune. Deceased was getting Rs.13,500/­ per month towards salary. Applicants are parents of deceased. They were dependent of deceased. Hence, applicants prayed for compensation to the extent of Rs.15,00,000/­from non­applicant. 03. Non­applicant filed his written statement at Ex.12 and submitted as under :­ Judgment in M.A.C.P.No.208/2015 ­3­ Its defence is of total denial. Age, income and manner of accident stated by applicants are denied. It is denied that driver of bus was driving it in rash and negligent manner. On the other hand, motor cycle rider i.e deceased tried to overtake the bus from the left side and as he could not maintain his balance on road. Motor cycle fell and came under left rear wheel of bus. Thus, deceased is responsible for said accident. With these submissions it prayed for dismissal of claim against him. 04.In pursuance thereto, following issues arise for my determination and I have recorded my findings thereon for the reasons stated below. I S S U E S FINDINGS 1)Do applicants prove that accident took place on 26.4.2014 at about 3.10 p.m. Kalewadi­Pimpri road, due to rash and negligent driving by the driver of bus bearing registration No.MH­12­FZ­8403 and Roshan Bhimrao Kharat died due to the accidental injuries ?Yes. 2)Does N.A prove that deceased was driving his motorcycle in rash and negligent manner and tried to overtake the bus from the left side and thus contributed the negligence ? No. 3)Whether the applicants are entitled to get compensation ? If yes, to what extent ?Yes, As per final order 4)What order and award ? As per final order R E A S O N S 05. As to Issues No.1 to 3 : The applicants No.1 has adduced her own evidence Judgment in M.A.C.P.No.208/2015 ­4­ by way of affidavit at Exh.15. Her Affidavit is as per the contents in the application and she has relied upon following documents. Sr. No.Details Ex. No. Date 1) Date of incidence as per F.I.R. 20 26.4.2014 2) Date of F.I.R. 20 26.4.2014 3) Spot Panchanama 21 27.4.2014 4) Death notification 23 26.4.2014 5) P.M. report 24 26.4.2014 6) Inquest Panchnama 22 26.4.2014 06.

Details of deceased : Sr. No.Details 1) Name Roshan Bhimrao Kharat. 2) Age 26 years. Judgment in M.A.C.P.No.208/2015 ­5­ 3) Nature of occupation Private service 08. The applicant No.1, the mother of deceased, filed her affidavit at Ex.15. She deposed that applicant No.2 is father of deceased. She stated that on 26.4.2014, at 3.30 pm, deceased Roshan was driving his motor cycle and one Dipak was pillion rider on hero Honda motor cycle bearing registration No. MH­14_ BY­ 5332. He was coming from Kalewadi to Pimpri Camp along with Dipak. Roshan was driving motor cycle in moderate speed, observing all the Traffic Rules and Regulations. When motor cycle reached to Mahalaxmi Cement Godown Kalewadi, PMPML bus bearing registration No. MH­12­ FZ­ 8403 coming from back side of motor cycle dashed motor cycle. It was being driven in rash and negligent manner by its driver. Both Dipak and Roshan died on the spot. Police registered the offence against bus driver. 09. Applicant No.1 further deposed that deceased was 26 years old at the time of accident. He was in service of First flight courier and was getting Rs.13,500/­ per month towards salary. They are parents and dependent of deceased. Hence, she prayed for compensation to the extent of Rs.15,00,000/­ from non­applicant. 10. During cross examination of this witness, she stated that deceased came under front wheel of bus but she further admitted that she has mentioned in affidavit that motor cycle rider was driving it from left side of bus. She stated that deceased was getting Rs.12,500/­p.m towards salary. Nothing Judgment in M.A.C.P.No.208/2015 ­6­ more could be brought on record during cross examination of this witness by non­applicant. Non­applicant examined Mohan Salunke the driver of bus at Ex.31. He stated that deceased was trying to overtake from left side of bus and as he could not control motor cycle, he came under rear wheel of bus. Thus, I perused the chargesheet filed on record. It appears from the statement of witnesses that deceased was driving his motor cycle from left side of bus in parallel direction but as bus came on left side, it dashed motor cycle and accident took place. I do not see any contributory negligence of deceased. Chargesheet is against Mohan Salunkhe. Thus, it is proved from police documents and evidence of applicant that deceased died in accident which took place because of rash and negligent driving of bus involved in an accident. 11. So far as income of deceased is concerned, applicant no.1 stated in application, that deceased was getting Rs.13,500/­per month. Whereas in cross examination stated as Rs.12,500/­p.m. She stated that deceased was in First Flight Courier Co. Ltd. But, applicants have not examined any witness from the said company to prove income of deceased. Thus, instead of taking salary of deceased as Rs.12,500/­p.m, I take it as Rs.7,000/­p.m notionally, considering cost of essential commodities and rates of minimum wages in the year 2015. It would not be exorbitant for non­applicant nor less for applicants. He was unmarried and hence, 1/2 is required to be deducted towards personal living expenses had deceased been alive. There actual income comes to Rs.3,500/­per month. Age of deceased was 26 years and hence, as per Sarla Judgment in M.A.C.P.No.208/2015 ­7­ Varma .Vs. DTC AIR 2009 SC 3109, the multiplier of 17 is applicable in the present case. Thus, actual loss of dependency comes to Rs.3500 X 12 months X 17 Multiplier = Rs.7,14,000/­. In addition to it, applicants are entitled for Rs.15,000/­ towards funeral expenses and Rs.15,000/­ towards loss estate as held in case of National Insurance Company Vs. Pranay Shethi Judgment of 5 Judges of Supreme Court, SPECIAL LEAVE PETITION (CIVIL) NO.25590 OF 2014 decided on 31.10.2017. 12.Thus, total amount of compensation payable to the applicants come to Rs.7,44,000/­ This amount includes the compensation paid under no fault liability. Therefore, the amount if already paid to applicants by the non applicant, would be deducted from the above amount. Apportionment of amount ? 13.Said amount be divided equally between applicants. Who is liable to pay ? 14.The bus is owned by PMPML. It is exempted from taking insurance Policy. Thus, non­applicant alone is liable to pay compensation. Hence, I pass the following order, by answering Issues No.1 to 3 accordingly . O R D E R (1)The claim petition of applicants is allowed with proportionate costs against N.A. (2) Non applicant shall jointly and severally pay sum of Judgment in M.A.C.P.No.208/2015 ­8­ Rs.7,44,000/­ (Rupees Seven Lacs Forty Four Thousand only) including N.F.L. amount, to the applicants as a compensation U/Sec.166 of Motor Vehicles Act, with interest @ 7% per annum from the date of claim petition i.e. 24.02.2015 till its full realization. (3) It shall be divided equally between applicants and their share shall be paid to them by account payee cheque, after due verification by the advocate. (4)Non applicants shall bear their own costs. (5) Award be drawn up accordingly. ( S.M.Menjoge ) 10th May 2018.

Kale J U D G M E N T (Delivered on this 28 th day of September 2020) 1­By way of this petition under section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act, applicants have claimed compensation in respect of death of Kaluram Pandurang Rokade in motor vehicular accident caused on 14.07.2014. 2­ In the present matter initially claim was filed for the compensation for the injuries sustained by Kaluram Pandurang Rokade. During the pendency of claim petition unfortunately Shri. Kaluram died and claim is amended. 3­Case of the applicant in short, is as under : The accident which gave rise to this claim took place CNR No. 3 M.A.C.P. No. 191/2015 MHPU01­005375­2015 Judgment on 14.07.2014 at about 10.30 a.m. in front of grocery shop of Shri Dnyaneshwar Pandurang Rokade at post village Pargaon Memane, Taluka Purandar, District Pune. At the time of incident, applicant was gathering/collecting dry branches of Babhul tree's which were cut by Ramesh Raosaheb Gaikwad. At that time one small tempo (Chota Hatti) bearing registration No. MH­12­JF­0363 came in a very high and excessive speed from Mavadi Pimpri road. It was going towards Saswad. The tempo driver was driving tempo rashly and negligently. He was drunken. Due to excessive speed and liquor consumption he lost control over his vehicle and dashed to applicant. Thus accident took place due to sole mistake of tempo driver. 4­ After the accident police of Je juri Police station inquired into the matter and registered offence against driver of the tempo bearing No.MH­12­JF­0363, Eknath Vishnu Devkar under various sections of Indian Penal Code and Motor Vehicles Act holding him responsible for causing accident. 5­It is further submitted that, at the time of accident deceased was 55 years old. He was farmer and earning Rs.10,000/­ per month. All the applicants were dependent upon him. Due to his sudden death, applicants suffered set back in their lives. The accident took place due to sole negligence of driver (opponent No.1) who was employee of Tempo owner (Opponent No. 2) of offending vehicle. CNR No. 4 M.A.C.P. No. 191/2015 MHPU01­005375­2015 Judgment Opponent No. 3 is registered owner. It is, therefore, prayed that, claim petition be allowed against all opponents in terms of prayer clause. 6­ Opponent No. 1 though appeared did not file his say. Hence matter proceeded without his say. 7­Opponent Nos. 2 and 3, owner of tempo appeared in the matter and filed their written statement. All the averments in petition are denied in toto. The particulars like age of applicant, his occupation, income and manner of accident are denied. It is specifically submitted that, there is mistake of opponent No. 1, driver of tempo. So, they are not at all responsible for paying any compensation. With these contentions opponent Nos.2 and 3, prayed for dismissal of the claim against them . 8­Considering rival pleadings, following issues were framed by my learned pred ecessor below Exh. 34. I have reproduced the same along with my findings thereon for the reasons given below.

As per final order. REASONS Admitted Facts : 9­ The involvement of tempo bearing No. MH­12­JF­ 0363 in accident is admitted. Evidence and documents : 10­The applicants examined brother of injured Dnyaneshwar Pandurang Rokade AW1 (Exh.35) and wife Smt.Mangal Kaluram Rokade AW 3 (Exh. 46) in support of contentions in the claim petition. Apart from that, applicants also relied on various documents viz. F.I.R. (Exh. 44) Medical bills (Exh. 45 collectively). Applicants also examined Shri. Ramesh Raosaheb Gaikwad AW 2, (Exh.41), Dr. Vishal Baliram Rokade AW 4 (Exh. 48), Dr. Vinayak Mahalsakant Khade AW 5 (Exh. 52). The opponents examined Somnath Vishnu Devkar (Opponent No. 2) vide Exh. 69, Shri Yashwant Namdev Satre (Exh. 89) who has produced and proved Bill (Exh. 90) and Shri. Shamrao Prakash Waghaj (Exh. 97). He has produced original Tax Invoices of India Shopee ( Exh.98 to 101). Opponents also examined Shri.Vijaykant Jagannath Bhutkar DW 3 (Exh. 102) for opponents 2 and 3 for. Bills CNR No. 6 M.A.C.P. No. 191/2015 MHPU01­005375­2015 Judgment referred by defence (Exh. 103) amounting to Rs. 12950/­ and after concession (Exh. 104) of Rs.10,000/­. As to Issue Nos. 1 to 3 11­ All the points are discussed simultaneously for the sake of convenience. Admittedly, initially claim was filed for injuries sustained by the victim. However, unfortunately the injured died during the pendency of this claim. The issues involved are thus dealt with accordingly looking to change in circumstances and scenario. 12­ Before touching the merits, it is necessary to deal with objections raised by the opponents. The opponents raised two fold objection as follows : (a)The claim is not filed by authorised person. (b)There is no nexus between accident and death. Objection (a) 13­As far as objection regarding filing of claim is concerned, initially the claim was filed by brother of deceased. Thereafter, by way of amendment all the legal heirs of the deceased i.e. wife and kids are implemented as party/applicants. In any case a claim for compensation can be filed under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 by injured himself, any legal representative of the deceased and/or by any agent duly authorised. 14­In the case at hand the claim was initially filed by the brother of deceased as legal representative and thereafter CNR No. 7 M.A.C.P. No. 191/2015 MHPU01­005375­2015 Judgment all the legal heirs are implemented as applicants by way of amendment. The said order of amendment is neither objected nor challenged by the opponents till today. As such, mere objection at the fag end do not survive. Objection (b): 15­As regards objection pertaining to nexus between accident and death is concerned, quick reference of evidence of wife of deceased would be essential. The wife of deceased Smt. Mangal Kaluram Rokade deposed as AW 3 at Exh. 46. She specifically deposed that, soon after accident her husband became unconscious. He was taken to Dhanvantari Hospital for preliminary treatment and thereafter shifted to Bharti Hospital. After discharged in the month of September 2014, follow­up treatment was going on till December­2014. In October 2017 he was again admitted in Bharti Hospital for surgery. Since the date of accident her husband was bedridden. He was unable to get up, have food or even to talk. He was not understanding any communication (verbal/ gesture). Till the last surgery, he was supplied liquid food through tube. As they were unable to afford nursing charges, she personally look after her husband. The entire evidence is thus crystal clear to show unfortunate saga took place since the date of accident till the death of the injured. Apart from merely raising objection, opponents have not brought any evidence even to remotely show that, death do not occur due to accidental injuries. CNR No. 8 M.A.C.P. No. 191/2015 MHPU01­005375­2015 Judgment 16­As a general principle of law, he who asserts shall prove the same. The applicants have specifically brought on record all the unfortunate events resulting into the death of the injured. Per contra, the opponents merely raised technical objection. It is necessary to keep in mind that, since the accident the injured never get up from bed. He was continuously kept on liquid diet. The most unfortunate part is incapability of the family to afford proper medical and nursing services due to economical condition. It would have been very unbearable for all the family members to see their most loving person in the house in such a traumatic condition. 17­The accident took place in the year 2014. Since then the injured was bedridden due to brain injury. He was continuously taking treatment till his death. Even in the year 2017 he underwent surgery regarding brain. Lastly, on 16.04.2018 he died. As already stated the opponents only raised objection. Neither any alternate theory regarding death or probability of cause of death is raised. The evidence of wife of injured clearly shows that the death is result of brain injury caused due to the accident only. 18­ Though the claim was initially filed for compensation against injuries caused, in view of amendment application (Exh. 59) the claim was amended soon after the death of the injured. As such the claim is required to be treated for compensation due to death only. This must be the reason the CNR No. 9 M.A.C.P. No. 191/2015 MHPU01­005375­2015 Judgment written arguments are also regarding cause of death and nexus between accident and demise of injured. 19­Opponent No. 2, Shri. Somnath Vishnu Devkar examined himself as DW 1 (Exh. 69). It has come in his evidence that, he has purchased the offending tempo from opponent No. 3. He has admitted that on the day of accident his brother Eknath Vishnu Devkar (Opponent No.1) was driving the tempo involved in the accident. He also admitted that his brother was having habit of drinking liquor. It is further admitted that, as accident occurred due negligence of his brother, he tried to compromise the matter. As such, it is not at all necessary to further discuss point of negligence. 20­As far as income is concerned, in the claim petition itself it is mentioned that, the deceased was earning Rs.10,000/­ per month. He was 55 years old man. He was maintaining his family satisfactorily till his last breath. As such if at all there is no any concrete evidence regarding income, still if the notional income is considered as Rs. 9,000/­ per month, it will suffice the purpose. 21­Now what remains is to decide 'just compensation'. It has already come on record that, accident took place due to negligence of tempo driver. The death has occurred during prolonged treatment being taken due to accidental injuries. 22­As far as expenses of prolonged treatment are considered applicants have furnished original medical bills of CNR No. 10 M.A.C.P. No. 191/2015 MHPU01­005375­2015 Judgment Rs.3,48,939/­ as per written submission placed on record along with Exh. 107. It is not the defence that, those are false or fabricated bills. Nonetheless our Parent High Court in Dr. Dattaraya Laxman Shinde V/s Nana Raghunath Hire and others, 2013, ACJ 474 specifically held that, Tribunal is not bound by strict rule of evidence. When original bills are produced on record and no specific case is made out by the defence that those are fabricated one, tribunal shall consider those bills. As such, though no any witness is separately examined by the applicant, to prove the bills, as the original bills are filed on record, applicants are entitled for entire amount of expenses of Rs.3,48,939/­ as compensation under this head. 23­Opponents have examined Yashwant Namdev Satre as DW 1 vide Exh. 89. He was Assistant Billing Manager at Bharti Hospital. The deceased was indoor patient in Bharti Hospital from 14.07.2014 to 15.09.2014. The total bill of hospitalization was Rs.1,09,597/­. After concession of Rs. 57,788/­, applicants have paid Rs.51,809/­ towards final bill. The said bill is at Exh. 90. Similarly, deceased was again admitted on 10.12.2014 till 20.12.2014 as indoor patient in Bharti Hospital. The total bill amount is Rs. 6,730/­. 24­ However, the applicants while submitting list of bills along with Exh.107 have fairly deleted some of the entries for want of receipt. If the evidence lead by the opponents is considered, the amount will be more than the amount mentioned in the list along with Exh.107. When CNR No. 11 M.A.C.P. No. 191/2015 MHPU01­005375­2015 Judgment these discrepancies were pointed out to the Advocate for applicants and asked whether they want to enhance their amount, she clearly stated that, she had the bills as mentioned in the list and do not want to claim any extra amount. The fair submissions are accepted. 25­ As far as evidence of DW2 Shamrao Prakash Waghaj at Exh. 97 is considered, he is distributor and sub dealer of Ayurvedic Products. He has produced and proved four tax invoices of Rs. 14,610/­ each vide Exh. 98 to 101. It comes to Rs. 58,440/­. This amount is already mentioned in the list provided by the applicant and therefore no further discussion is required. 26­As this claim is now considered as a death claim, for compensation under other heads, the notional income for the purpose of computation of compensation is held as Rs. 9,000/­. The evidence on record shows that, deceased was 61 years at the time of death. His date of birth in school Leaving Certificate is 09.09.1956. He was married and having four dependents. As such 1/4th amount is required to be deducted towards personal expenses. So also looking to his income and age, 15% amount is required to be added towards future prospects in view of National Insurance Company Limited V/s Pranay Sethi and others A.I.R. 2017 SC 5157. So also looking to age, multiplier of 7 would be applicable, in view of Sarla Verma and others V/s Delhi Transport Corporation and another 2009 ACJ 1298 . The final calculation therefore would be as follows. CNR No. 12 M.A.C.P. No. 191/2015 MHPU01­005375­2015 Judgment Sr. No. Head Compensation awarded iIncome Rs. 9,000/­ iiFuture Prospects Rs.1,350/­ (i.e.15% of the income) iiiDeduction towards personal expenditure Rs.2,588/­ (1/4th amount of Rs.9,000/­ + Rs.1,350/­) ivTotal Income : Rs.7,762/­ (i.e. Rs.9,000 + 1,350 – 2,588) vMultiplier 7 viLoss of future income Rs 6,52,008/­ (Rs.7,762 x12x7) viiLoss of consortium Rs.40,000/­ viiiFuneral expenses Rs.15,000/­ ixLoss of estate Rs.15,000/­ xHospitalization and Medical expenses Rs.3,48,939/­ Total compensation awarded : Rs.10,70,947/­ along with interest as applicable. Interest: 27­The total compensation will be thus Rs.10,70,947/­ (inclusive of interim compensation awarded under section 140 of Motor Vehicle Act.) As far as rate of interest is concern, looking to the prevailing rate of interest of banks, applicants would be entitled for interest @ 9% per annum from the date of petition till actual realization of award of compensation. 28­ Admittedly, accident took place due to sole negligence of driver of opponent No.1. Opponent Nos. 2 is owner and opponent No. 3 is the registered owner of offending vehicle. Thus all the opponents are jointly and CNR No. 13 M.A.C.P. No. 191/2015 MHPU01­005375­2015 Judgment severally liable to pay compensation to applicants. Hence I answer Issue Nos. 1 to 3 accordingly. 29­In sequel I pass following order. O R D E R 1­Claim Petition is allowed with costs. 2­The Opponent Nos. 1 to 3 shall jointly and severally pay compensation of Rs.10,70,947/­(Rs. Ten Lakhs Seventy Thousand Nine Hundred Forty Seven only ) including interim compensation awarded u/s 140 of Motor Vehicles Act along with costs and interest @ 9 % per annum from the date of petition till realization of entire amount to the applicants. 3­Out of total amount of Rs.10,70,947/­ of compensation the share of applicants would be as follows : (a)­i 50% to applicant No. 1A (i.e. Rs.5,35,474/­) (a)­ii20% each to applicant Nos. 2B and 3C (i.e. Rs. 2,14,189/­ each ) (a)­iii10% to the applicant No. 4D( i.e. Rs.1,07,095/­ ) (b)Out of amount of Rs.5,35,474/­ share of applicant No. 1, Rs. 2,00,000/­ be kept in fixed deposit for a period of five years in any Nationalised bank of the choice of applicant and rest of the amount be paid to her by account payee cheque, on due verification.
