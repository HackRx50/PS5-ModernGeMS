CLAIM : Claim under Section 166 of M.V.Act, 1988 for compensation of Rs.3,00,000/­. J U D G M E N T [ Delivered on 28th April, 2017 ] The present petition is filed under Section166 of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 for grant of compensation on account of injuries sustained to claimant Rahul S/o Sahebrao @ Manaji Shejwal in motor vehicle accident held on 19.12.2014. 2.Brief facts of the case­ It is the case of claimant that on 19.12.2014 he was travelling on motorcycle bearing registration No.MH­20­DB­1156 from village Bhadji, Tq. Khultabad and coming towards his house at village Padegaon, Aurangabad. The motorcycle was driven by him in proper and moderate speed from extreme left side of the road. When he reached on Khultabad­Phulambri road in village Bhadji near house of one Shri Gavale at about 13.45 hours, at that time, one Luxury Bus bearing registration No.MH­15­AK­0699 came from Khultabad side in very high, excessive speed, rash and negligent manner and gave dash to the motorcycle on which the claimant was travelling because of the said dash, the claimant sustained grievous injuries. The claimant was immediately shifted to Government Medical College and Hospital, Aurangabad where he has taken treatment as indoor patient from 19.12.2014 to 03.01.2015. During the course of 3 M.A.C.P.No.110/2015, [ Judgment ]. treatment, he was operated for his injuries and rod was fixed in his right hand andhe has incurred expense of more than Rs.25,000/­ to 30,000/­ on his treatment. 3.On the basis of report lodged by Kiran Shejwal, Khultabad Police Station registered offence vide Crime No.I­186/2014 under Section 279, 337,338, 427 of IPC against respondent No.1 the driver of Luxury Bus bearing registration No.MH­15­AK­0699. 4.The claimant further contended that prior to the accident, he was possessing good and sound health and he was leading his life freely without any disability. At the time of accident, his age was 20 years. He was doing mason work and was earning Rs.9,000/­ per month. The claimant was maintaining himself and his family members. The claimant further contended that respondent No.1 was driving the said offending bus. It was owned by respondent No.2 and insured with respondent No.3. Therefore, respondent No.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the claimant. Thus, the claimant has claimed total compensation of Rs.3,00,000/­ including the compensation under other conventional heads. 5.Respondent No.1 & 2 filed their written statement at Exh­18. They contended that the accident happened because of negligence of claimant while riding his motorcycle bearing registration No.MH­20­DB­1156. They further 4 M.A.C.P.No.110/2015, [ Judgment ]. denied the age and income of claimant and submitted that the petition be rejected. 6.Respondent No.3 filed their written statement at Exh­15. They contended that the rider of motorcycle bearing registration No.MH­20­DB­1156 was driven by claimant in rash and negligent manner. They further contended that there was no negligency on the part of driver of Luxury Bus bearing registration No.MH­15­AK­0699. They further contended that on the day of accident Luxury Bus bearing registration No.MH­15­AK­0699 was not having valid permit and fitness certificate. Hence, respondent No.1 & 2 have breached the provisions of contract of insurance and the provisions of Motor Vehicles Act. They further submitted that the insurer is not liable to pay compensation and the petition be rejected. 7.From the rival pleadings of the parties, I have framed following issues below Exh­22 and I record my findings against each of them for the reasons stated below. I S S U E S F I N D I N G S 1.Whether the claimant proves that he sustained injuries on 19.12.2014 at about 13.45 p.m. at village Bhadji, near the house of Gavale, on Khultabad to Phulambri road, in a motor vehicular accident ? .. Yes. 2.Whether the claimant proves that the accident took place because of negligent driving of driver of Luxury 5 M.A.C.P.No.110/2015, [ Judgment ]. Bus bearing registration No. MH­15­AK­0699 i.e. respondent No.1 ? .. Yes. 3.Whether the respondents prove that claimant was driving motorcycle bearing registration No.MH­20­DB­1156, in rash and negligent manner because of which the accident occurred ? .. No. 4.Whether claimant is entitled to get compensation ? If yes, to what extent and from whom ? .. Rs.75,000/­ with interest @8% per annum from respondent No.1 & 2 jointly and severally. 5.What order and award ? .. Claim is partly allowed. R E A S O N S 8.In order to substantiate the contentions raised in the petition, claimant examined himself as CW1 by filing his affidavit of evidence at Exh­26 and placed reliance on the relevant police papers pertaining to the accident. They are FIR at Exh­27, Crime Details Form at Exh­28, Injury Certificate at Exh­29, Form Comp.­''B''at Exh­32 and examined Dr. Parmeshwar Shivlal Jaiswal at Exh­ 31 and filed evidence close Pursis at Exh­33. 9.Respondent No.1 & 2 examined Dnyaneshwar Bapurao Lokhande as RW1 at Exh­34 and filed evidence close Pursis at Exh­35. 10.Respondent No.3 examined Milind Arjunrao Sasane as RW1 for 6 M.A.C.P.No.110/2015, [ Judgment ]. respondent No.3 at Exh­36 and filed evidence close Pursis at Exh­37. 11.Heard Learned advocate Shri S.D.Kamble for claimant, Shri V.S.Borkar for respondent No.1 & 2, Shri S.S.Rathi for respondent No.3. As to Issue No.1 to 3 : 12.Learned advocate appearing for claimants submitted that the police papers pertaining to the accident in question clearly indicates that the respondent No.1 was driving his Luxury Bus bearing registration No.MH­15­AK­0699 in high speed, rash and negligent manner and gave dash to the motorcycle on which the claimant was travelling. He further submitted that the respondent No.1 was driving the offending bus. The same was owned by respondent No.2 and insured with respondent No.3. Hence, respondent No.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the claimant. 13.Having considered the oral submissions made on behalf of claimants and respondents, I have gone through oral as well as documentary evidence placed on record by the claimant. It is seen from the testimony of CW1 and the copy of F.I.R. at Exh­27, Spot Panchanama at Exh­28 that the respondent No.1 was driving Luxury Bus bearing registration No.MH­15­AK­0699 in high speed, rash and negligent manner. The RW1 driver of offending Bus bearing registration No.MH­15­AK­0699 has admitted in his cross examination that charge­sheet is filed against him. He has not challenged the FIR nor have made 7 M.A.C.P.No.110/2015, [ Judgment ]. any application to the police authorities stating that he was not negligent for the accident. The admission of RW1 itself shows that he has not taken any steps nor made any application to the police authorities nor recorded his statement with police authority, in respect of said accident. Therefore, it cannot be said that RW1 was not responsible for the accident. Hence, I answer Issue No.1 & 2 as 'Yes' and Issue No.3 as 'No'. As to Issue No.4 : 14.The claimant has deposed in his affidavit of evidence at Exh­26 that he was possessing good and sound health and was leading free life without any disability. He was doing mason work and used to earn Rs.9,000/­ per month. From the said income, he was maintaining his family members but due to said accident, he has become permanent disable. Hence, he could not do the work of mason properly. The claimant has not produce any documentary evidence or any other evidence to show that he was doing mason work, at the time of accident. Therefore, it will be proper to take Rs.4,500/­ as notional income of the claimant. The annual income of the claimant comes to Rs.54,000/­. 15.The claimant has deposed in his affidavit that at the time of accident, his age was 20 years. The claimant has not filed any document on record to show that his age was 20 years, at the time of accident. No suggestion about the age is given by the advocates for respondents. Hence, I take the age 8 M.A.C.P.No.110/2015, [ Judgment ]. deposed by him as his age, at the time of accident. The claimant has deposed that he was 20 years old at the time of accident. Therefore, the multiplier of 18 is applied as per the guidelines issued by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Smt. Sarla Verma Vs Delhi Transportation Corporation and another reported in AIR 2009 (SC) 3104. By applying multiplier of 18 to his annual income of Rs.54,000/­, the loss of earning comes to Rs.9,72,000/­. 16.The claimant has examined Parmeshwar Shivlal Jaiswal Orthopedic Surgeon. The said surgeon has deposed that the claimant has restriction of movement of right radio Ulnar joint, pronation 10 degree. There is scar at right side at his nose measuring 4Cm. The shape of the nose is distorted. He has permanent disability 15% for facial disfigurement and total disability of 25% by Mc Bride Scale. 17.In cross examination doctor has admitted that he has not advised him to take fresh X­Ray neither he found it necessary to take his X­ray. He, on the basis of the hospital papers and clinical examination has issued disability certificate to him. He has further admitted in his cross examination that he has issued disability certificate by examining X­ray dated 19.12.2014 and other post operative X­ray taken before discharging the patient. He has further admitted that except his hand, the patient was not having any grievous injuries on his part of body and discharge card at Exh­33 shows that there is no bony deformity seen in 9 M.A.C.P.No.110/2015, [ Judgment ]. its clinical examination, at the time of discharge. The certificate issued is dated 23.3.2017 i.e. approximately after two years. The expert has admitted in his deposition that he has not taken fresh X­ray of the patient. He has issued the certificate on the basis of X­rays which were taken of the patient at the time of discharge from the Government Hospital. The patient was 20 years old, at the time of accident. Therefore, there were chances that his injuries would have healed. The certificate issued by the expert examined by the claimant is after two years of the accident. Therefore, the same could not be said to be exact and accurate as the witness has himself deposed that before issuing the said certificate, he has not advised any radiological test to the claimant. He has further admitted that the claimant is not having any effect to his day to day activities and the discharge card does not show any bony deformity in clinical examination. As the expert examine by the claimant has admitted that the discharge card at Exh­33 shows that there is no bony deformity and the injuries has not effected day to day activities of the claimant, clearly shows that the claimant has not suffered any permanent disability. The evidence brought on record by the claimant clearly shows that he has suffered injuries in motor vehicular accident. Therefore, in my opinion, it would be just to grant compensation for the pain, damages and mental trauma to claimant. Hence, I grant an amount of Rs.75,000/­ as damages for pain and mental trauma suffered 10 M.A.C.P.No.110/2015, [ Judgment ]. by the claimant because of accident. 18.The Learned advocate appearing for respondent No.3 submitted that the offending vehicle was not having valid permit as well as fitness certificate, at the time of accident. The said fact is proved by them by examining RW1 for respondent No.3 the officer of Transport Authority who has produced the details of offending vehicle. According to said details, the offending vehicle was not having valid permit and fitness certificate at the time of accident. Therefore, the insurer is not liable to pay compensation as respondent No.1 & 2 have committed infraction of Law and relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. vs Challa Upendrarao and Others reported in AIR 2004 Supreme Court 4882 . 19.The respondent No.3 has examined officer of R.T.O. The deposition of RW1 at Exh­36 and the vehicle particulars filed by him, as per his official record at Exh­38 shows that the offending vehicle Luxury Bus bearing registration No.MH­15­AK­0699 was not having valid permit as well as valid fitness certificate on the day of accident. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the authority relied by respondent No.3 supra has held that the insurer is not liable to pay compensation if there is infraction of law. The respondent No.1 & 2 has plied their vehicle without valid permit and fitness certificate, it amounts to infraction of Law. Therefore, I hold that the insurer is not liable to pay 11 M.A.C.P.No.110/2015, [ Judgment ]. compensation. 20.So far as rate of interest is concern, taking into consideration the amount of compensation and the period of pendency of petition, it will be just to grant 8 % interest per annum on compensation amount, from the date of filing of petition, till the realization of entire compensation amount. Considering the object of Motor Vehicles Act, it will be proper if the insurance company satisfy the award and recover the same from respondent No.1 & 2. In the result, I answer issue No.4 accordingly and proceed to pass the following order. O R D E R 1.The claim petition is partly allowed. 2.Claimant is entitle for total compensation of Rs.75,000/­. 3.Respondent No.3 do pay first the compensation amount of Rs.75,000/­ to claimant along with interest @8% per annum, from the date of filing of petition, till realization of entire amount and then recover the same from respondent No.1 & 2 according to Law. 4.On depositing compensation amount of Rs.75,000/­ in the court, it be paid to him by account payee cheque on proper identification. 5.Respondent No.1 & 2 do pay jointly and severally proportionate cost of the petition to the claimant and bear their own cost. 6.Award be drawn accordingly.

Hence, he was sent to his village. 14.Respondent No.2 has deposed in his affidavit of evidence at Exh­42 that there was no fault of his vehicle and the accident has happened because of negligency of deceased. In his cross examination, he has admitted that the accident had happened by his vehicle. He further admitted that his driver has informed him about the accident at about 12.00 midnight. At that time, he was in Pune. He further admitted that his driver has told him that he has given dash from the backside to the vehicle of deceased and his vehicle was damaged on the left side. The spot panchanama was carried on next day of the accident i.e. 27.2.2015. The registration number of offending vehicle is mentioned in the said panchanama. Therefore, it cannot be said that the offending vehicle has been implanted in the accident. The respondent No.1 driver of the offending vehicle has not stepped into witness­box, so as to rebut the testimony of claimant's 10 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. witness and the police papers on record. The testimony of CW3 clearly shows that the accident has happened because vehicle Tata AC bearing registration No.MH­20­DE­2278 has given dash from backside to the motorcycle of deceased. The evidence on record also shows that the driver of Tata AC was driving his vehicle in rash and negligent manner. 15.In New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs G.N.Gopalagowda, the FIR disclosed that the petitioner was riding scooter in rash and negligent manner and on the sampige road hit against tree, as a result, he fell down and sustained injuries. The FIR named the petitioner as accused of committing offence of rash and negligent driving. 16.In Dharamdev Vs Mohinder Singh & Ors., the FIR was lodged after six months of the accident and the record brought by the petitioner did not showed that he has suffered injuries because of motor vehicle accident. 17.Shivajirao Nilkanthrao Patil Vs Maruti Appa Tade, the accident had occurred on 7.8.1995 and report was lodged on 26.1.1998. 18.In Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs Kalawati and Ors., the vehicle involved in the accident was seized after six months and the statement of witnesses were recorded after one and half month. 19.In Gitaben Dineshbhai Thakkar Vs Musabhai Ahmedbhai Garasiya, the witness examined by the claimant was not trustworthy. 11 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. 20.In New India Assurance Company Ltd. Vs Laxman S/o Dadarao Karpe & Ors., the FIR stated that the case was of hit & run and the owner of the vehicle has taken the defence in his written statement that his vehicle was not involved in the accident. 21.In Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd. Through it's Branch Manager, 2nd Floor, Rajendra Chamber, Adalat Road, Aurangabad Vs Meera W/o Raju Chaudhary & Ors., the Investigating Officer has stated that he has learn from discrete source about involvement of vehicle but has not recorded statement of the person who has given the information. 22.In United India Insurance Co. Ltd vs Pawan Tikkiwal and Ors., the deceased and his son respondent No.1 met with an accident when their scooter slipped due to rough and bumpy road the father of respondent No.1 expired on 14.9.2000 and the respondent No.1 for the first time on 27.3.2001 has alleged that he was dashed by jeep. In the said case, there were two versions of respondent No.1. The facts of authorities relied by respondent No.3 are different from the facts of present case. Therefore, the authorities cited by respondent No.3 are not applicable to the present case in hand. The number of offending vehicle was mentioned in the spot panchanama at Exh­19 which was drawn on the second day of the incident. The delay in lodging FIR does not fatal the case of claimants as RW2 the Investigation Officer has deposed that at the time of carrying Spot 12 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. Panchanama, CW3 was present on the spot and was not in proper mental condition. He has further deposed that as the statement of witnesses were not recorded, he has not filed report. The time of accident mentioned in the MLC also does not fatal the case of claimants as the MLC is recorded as per the version of the person who has admitted the deceased in hospital and CW3 was not in the hospital at the time of admitting deceased in hospital. The claimant has examined eyewitness who was travelling with the deceased, at the time of accident. I do not find any reason so as to disbelieve the evidence adduced by the claimants. Hence, I answer Issue No.1 as 'Yes' and Issue No.2 & 2­A as 'No'. As to Issue No.3 : 23.CW1 in her deposition has stated that her husband was running flour mill and earning Rs.15,000/­ per month. He was also doing business of transportation and earning Rs.30,000/­ per month and was also earning Rs.5,00,000/­ per year from agriculture. 24.CW2 has brought on record the notebooks maintained by the deceased at Exh­38 & 39. CW3 has deposed in his cross examination that the entries made in the notebooks are made by deceased Ashok Raut. Bare perusal of the said notebooks shows that the entries are in different handwriting. Therefore, it cannot be said that the notebooks were maintained by the deceased in respect of account of his business of flour mill and transportation. There is 13 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. also no evidence on record to show that the deceased was earning Rs.5,00,000/­ from agriculture. In absence of any documentary evidence about income of deceased, it will be proper to take Rs.4,500/­ as notional income of deceased. Therefore, the annual income of the deceased will be Rs.54,000/­. It appears from the record that the deceased was having five dependents, at the time of accident. Therefore, 1/4th of his annual income is deducted as his personal expenses. His annual earning after deduction comes to Rs.40,500/­. 25.CW1 has deposed in her evidence that the age of her husband was 26 years, at the time of accident but has not filed any documentary proof in support of age of deceased. Therefore, the age mentioned in Inquest Panchanama and Postmortem Report is taken into consideration. The age of deceased is mentioned as 28 years in Postmortem Report as well as in Inquest Panchanama. Hence, the multiplier of 17 is applied to the present case as per the guidelines issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Smt. Sarla Verma Vs Delhi Transportation Corporation and another reported in AIR 2009 SC 3104 . Therefore, the loss of dependency comes to Rs.6,88,500/­. 26.The claimant No.1 has lost her husband, therefore, she is entitle to Rs.1,00,000/­ towards consortium. The claimant No.1 is also entitle for an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ towards loss of estate as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kalpanaraj & Ors. vs Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation, reported 14 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. in 2014 (5) Scale 479 . 27.Claimant No.2 & 3 have lost their father. Therefore, they are entitle to Rs.1,00,000/­ each towards love and affection as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Juju Kuruvila & Ors. Vs Kunjujamma Mohan & Others reported in (2013) 9 S.C.C. 166 . 28.Claimant No.4 & 5 have lost their son and therefore, they are entitle for Rs.50,000/­ each towards love and affection of their deceased son as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in M. Mansoor and Anr. Vs United India Insurance Co.Ltd., reported in 2013 12 Scale 324 . 29.The claimants are further entitle to an amount of Rs.25,000/­ towards funeral expenses of deceased. Therefore, the claimants are entitle for total compensation of Rs.12,13,500/­. 30.The claimants have received Rs.50,000/­ towards interim compensation under the head of No Fault Liability. Therefore, it will be appropriate to deduct the said amount from total compensation. After deducting the amount of interim compensation, the amount of compensation comes to Rs.11,63,500/­. 31.It is seen from Exh­17,18,23,24 & 25 that the offending vehicle was owned by respondent No.2, driven by respondent No.1 and insured with respondent No.3 at the time of accident. In such circumstances, respondent No.1 15 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to claimants for the death of deceased. 32.So far as rate of interest is concern, considering the period of pendency of matter and the amount of compensation, interest @ 7% per annum from the date of filing the petition, till realization of compensation amount would meet the ends of justice. Hence, I answer Issue No.3 accordingly and pass the following order. O R D E R 1.Petition is partly allowed. 2.The claimant No.1 to 5 are entitle to get compensation of Rs.12,13,500/­ inclusive of No Fault Liability. 3.Respondent No.1 to 3 do pay an amount of Rs.11,63,500/­ exclusive of No Fault Liability to claimant No.1 to 5 towards compensation jointly and severally along with interest @ 7% per annum, from the date of filing of petition, till realization of entire amount. 4.The compensation amount of Rs.11,63,500/­ be appropriated amongst claimant No.1 to 5 as under­ i) Claimant No.1 – Rs.3,32,700/­. ii) Claimant No.2 & 3 – Rs.2,32,700/­ each. iii) Claimant No.4 & 5 – Rs.1,82,700/­ each. 5.Out of compensation amount payable to claimant No.1, an amount of Rs.2,00,000/­ be invested in Fixed Deposit in her name, in any Nationalized Bank for the period of two years and remaining amount be paid to her by account payee cheque, on identification. 6.Compensation amount payable to claimant No.2 & 3 be invested in Fixed Deposit in their name, in any Nationalized Bank till they attains majority and claimant No.1 is at liberty to withdraw the amount of interest 16 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. quarterly, if she desire so. 7.Out of compensation amount payable to claimant No.4 & 5, an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ each be invested in Fixed Deposit in their name, in any Nationalized Bank for the period of one year and remaining amount be paid to them by account payee cheque, on identification. 8.Respondent No.1 to 3 do pay jointly and severally proportionate cost of the petition to claimants and bear their won cost. 9.Award be drawn accordingly.

Mr A.Z. Biyabani, Advocate for Claimants. Mr D.M. Hange, Advocate for Respondent No.1 Mr S.G. Chapalgaonkar, Advocate for Respondent No.2 ....................................................................................................... J U D G M E N T (Delivered in open court on 13/11/2017) This petition is filed by the claimants for grant of compensation of Rs. 15,00,000/­ under Section 166 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. 2)Claimant's case in nutshell is as under :­ They have alleged that, Shaikh Kalim Ekbal Shaikh was driving jeep bearing No. Mh­20­BY­0039 on Jintur to Mantha road, proceeding towards Deogaon Phata. When he reached in front of Shakuntalabai Highschool, at that time, one truck baring No. Mh­06­K­5274 came from offending direction in high speed with rash and negligent manner and gave dash to the jeep. In the accident, jeep driver sustained serious injuries. Immediately, he was shifted to Mantha hospital for treatment. As he was serious, 3 [MACP No.448/2015] immediately shifted to Government Hospital, Aurangabad. During treatment, he expired on 30/05/2015. Medical Officer carried postmortem. 3)They have further alleged that, the concern police came on the spot, made inquiry and registered F .I.R. against truck driver under section 279, 338 and 304­A of I.P .C. Police prepared spot and inquest panchanama. 4)They have further contended that, deceased was just 25 years old at that time. The claimant No. 1 is widow, no. 2 is mother and nos. 3 and 4 are the minor brother and sister of the deceased. All claimants are depend upon him. He was Karta of his family. Due to his untimely death, claimants suffered mental agony and also facing financial crises. 5)They have further contended that, deceased was the driver by profession on the jeep of Mr. Shaikh Bilal. He was getting salary of Rs. 8,000/­ to 10,000/­p.m. According to claimants, respondent no. 1 is driver cum owner of the truck which was duly insured with respondent no. 2. Therefore, both respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation. 6)Respondent no. 1 has filed written statement vide Exh. 43 and denied allegations. He has admitted that an accident took place on 27/05/2015 but denied that, he was responsible for the accident. According to him, jeep driver came in high speed 4 with negligent manner and dashed to the truck, therefore, deceased was responsible for an accident. He has further contended that, he is the owner and driver of the truck which was duly insured with respondent no. 2. He was driving truck in very moderate speed with great precaution and committed no fault or negligence. Therefore, no liability can be fastened against him. He prayed claim may be rejected. 7)Respondent no. 2 has filed written statement vide Exh. 15 and also denied allegations. He has specifically contended that, deceased was neither driver nor he was getting salary of Rs. 8,000/­ p.m. Moreover, jeep driver and driver of the truck did not have license, therefore, insurance company is not liable to pay compensation. He has also contended that, as the jeep driver did not commit any fault or negligence, therefore, question of compensation does not arise. The spot panchanama is not correct. Police has registered offence against jeep driver without making inquiry. The truck did not have permit and fitness, it amounts to breach of conditions. On that ground also, claim is not tenable and it may be rejected. 8)From the rival pleadings of the parties, issues are framed and I record my findings against each of them for the reasons given below:­ 5 [MACP No.448/2015] SR. NO.ISSUES FINDINGS 1)Do petitioners prove tht Shaikh Kalim Iqbal Shaikh died due to injuries sustained in the motor vehicular accident dated 27/05/2015 ?: In the affirmative. 2)Do petitioners prove that accident had taken place due to rash and negligent driving of container Truck bearing registration No. MH­06­K­5274 by its driver i.e. respondent no. 1, insured with respondent no. 2 ?: In the affirmative. 3)What is just and reasonable amount of compensation and against whom it is to be awarded ?: In the affirmative. 4)Who is liable to pay compensation ? :Respondent Nos. 1 & 2 jointly and severally. 5)What should be the rate of interest ? :As per final order. 6)What order and Award? :As per final order. REASONS AS TO ISSUE NOS. 1 & 2 : 9) Issues nos. 1 & 2 are interlinked, therefore, I decide it intermingle to avoid repetitions and for court's convenience. 10) It has been alleged by the claimant that, Shaikh Kalim is died due to injuries sustained in the motor vehicular accident dated 27/05/2015, due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing No. MH­06­K­5274. Truck was insured with respondent 6 no. 2. To substantiate his contention, claimant has examined himself vide Exh. 17 and also examined jeep owner vide Exh. 21. He has also examined an eye witness Shri. Prakash Jadhav vide Exh. 45. She deposed that, on the date of accident, her husband was driving jeep in moderate speed on Jintur to Mantha road. When the said jeep reached in front of Shakuntalabai Highschool, at that time, one truck bearing No. MH­06­K­5274 came from offending direction in high speed with negligent manner and dashed to jeep. In the accident, her husband sustained grievous injuries and was shifted to Government Hospital at Aurangabad. During treatment, he expired on 30/05/2015. Inquest panchanama and postmortem report are field on record. 11)To support her contention, she also examined PW 3 Shri Prakash Jadhav vide Exh. 45. He is eye witness. I think, the testimony of this witness is important because, he had seen the accident personally and he was one of the passenger of the jeep. He has deposed that he sat on the rear seat of the jeep. The jeep was proceeding towards left side, at that time a truck came from offending direction and dashed to the jeep. In an accident he also sustained fracture injuries. During cross­examination nothing has came on record to shatter his evidence. 7 [MACP No.448/2015] 12)Not only this, learned Advocate for the claimant has attracted my attention towards the spot panchanama (Exh. 49). Spot panchanama consists sketch map of the road situatioin. It appears that, jeep was proceeding towards Deogaon Phata from Jintur side by left side. While truck was proceeding towards Jintur side. However, the said truck suddenly came towards wrong side. Jeep in question was towards extreme left side. Bonnet of the truck went towards wrong side. Therefore, we can assess that the truck driver committed a wrong and thereby an accident occurred. 13)Learned Advocate of respondent no. 2 has argued that, this accident is head on collision, therefore, contributory negligence may be held. I do not admit his proposition because, position of the truck demonstrate that it went towards wrong side. Moreover, respondent no. 1 is driver cum owner of the truck. He is an eye witness. It is pertinent to note that, he has not examined himself or any other witness. Even he has not cross­examined to the claimant's witnesses. However, respondent no. 2 has examined to respondent no. 1 as witness. This conduct of respondent no. 1 demonstrates that, he is trying to shift his liability on insurance company by hook or crook. Considering the documents, especially, F .I.R., Inquest panchanama, spot panchanama, postmortem, RC Book, Insurance Policy, it denotes that an accident took place on 27/05/2012 wherein Shaikh Kalim sustained injuries and 8 subsequently expired during treatment. The said truck was own by respondent no. 1 and was duly insured with respondent No. 2, therefore, I answer point Nos. 1 and 2 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NOS. 3 to 5 : 14)Learned Advocate for the claimant has argued that deceased was driver by profession with Mr. Shaikh Bilal and was getting salary of Rs. 8,000/­ to 10,000/­ p.m. To support his contention, claimant has examined owner of the jeep Shaikh Bilal vide Exh. 21 and contended that, he used to pay salary of Rs. 8,000/­ p.m. Learned Advocate for the claimant has further argued that, the driver is skilled worker, therefore, his monthly salary of Rs. 8,000/­ to 10,000/­ p.m. be considered. To support his contention he relied upon : a) Bithika Mazumdar and Another Vs Sagar Pal and Others reported in 2017 (2) T.A.C. 679 (S.C.) b) Minu Raut Vs. Satya Pradyumna Mohapatr reported in 2013 AIR SCW 5375 . I am of view that, though the owner of the jeep deposed that, deceased was driver on his jeep and was paying salary of Rs. 8,000/­ p.m., but there is no documentary evidence to that effect. No Bank statement is produced. Moreover, Shaikh Bilal is said to be a business man. (Running Small Scale business and Grocery Shop) then, why he has not filed income tax return or 9 [MACP No.448/2015] profit and loss account. In absence of cogent and constructive evidence, the income of deceased shall be considered as per “Notional Income Theory ”. A person who has no specific income, his income Rs. 4,500/­ needs to be considered in view of Ramchandrappa Vs Manager Royal Sundaram Aliance Insurance Company Ltd. 2011 (4) T.A.C. (SC) ] case. Thus, his income is assessed of Rs. 4,500/­ p.m. As per driving license (Exh. 24) the date of birth of the deceased is 11/03/1993 and the date of an accident is 27/05/2015. Therefore, his age would be 22 years at that time. Thus, in view of Smith Sarla Verma and ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Ors. Reported in 2009 (2) T.A.C. 677 (Supreme Court ) the multiplier “18” would be applicable. There are four dependent, therefore, in view of Smith Sarla Varma's case (Cited Supra ) there would be 1/4th deduction towards personal and living expenses. Considering the circumstances, I calculate the compensation as follows : Sr. No. Heads Calculations Rupees 1 Yearly income of deceased : Rs.4,500 p.m. X 12 = 54,000 3 1/4th deduction as personal and living expenses : Rs. 54,000 – 13,500 =40,500 10 4 Compensation after applying multiplier of “18” : Rs. 40,500 x 18 = 7,29,000 5 Loss of Love & affection 1,00,000 6 Loss of consortium 40,000 7 Funeral­expenses 15,000 Total = 8,84,000/­ Thus, the claimants are entitled compensation of Rs. 8,84,000/­. 15) The claimants have requested to grant interest @ Rs.18% per annum. I am of the view that, the said interest would be exorbitant. Instead of that, as per Kanhsingh Vs Tukaram 2015 (2) T.A.C. 689 (Supreme Court) the interest @ Rs.9% per annum would be proper and reasonable. In view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Khenyei versus New India Assurance Company Limited and others. The claimant can recover the aforesaid compensation from the respondents jointly and severally. Thus, I answer issue No. 3 in the affirmative and proceed to pass the following order:­ ORDER 1) The claim­petition is allowed with proportionate costs. 11 [MACP No.448/2015] 2)The Respondent no. 1 & 2 are held liable jointly and severally to pay the compensation. of Rs. 8,84,000/­ (Rs. Eight Lacs & Eighty Four Thousand Only) to the claimants with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of petition, i.e. 16/07/2015, till realization of the entire payment, after deducting the NFL amount, if paid. 3)Out of awarded compensation, an amount of Rs. 4,84,000/­ (Rs. Four Lacs & Eighty Four Thousand Only) be given to Claimant No. 1 being widow. 4)An amount of Rs. 2,00,000/­ (Rs. Two Lacs Only) be given to Claimant No. 2 being mother. 5)An amount of Rs. 2,00,000/­ (Rs. Two Lac Only) be invested in the name of Claimant No. 2 being mother of minor Claimant Nos. 3 (Anjum) and 4 (Nadim) in any Nationalized Bank for their welfare till they attain majority. 6)Claimants to pay court fee as per rule. 7)An award be drawn accordingly.

J U D G M E N T [ Delivered on 3rd February, 2017 ] The present petition is filed for grant of compensation under Section 166 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, on account of unfortunate death of Ashok Onkar Raut R/o Vihamandwa, Tq.

Claimants are the legal representatives of deceased Ashok Onkar Raut who lost his life on 27.2.2015 because of injuries sustained to him in motor vehicle accident held on 26.2.2015. 2.Brief facts of the claim­ It is the case of the claimants that on 26.2.2015 at about 10.45 p.m. deceased was driving motorcycle bearing registration No. MH­20­CF­3910 on Aurangabad­Beed road near village Aadgaon Javle.

He was shifted to Civil Hospital, Pachod and thereafter shifted to Government Medical College and Hospital, Aurangabad for medical treatment but he died on 27.2.2015 at about 00.45 a.m. 3.On the basis of report lodged by Vikas Babasaheb Rodge on 2.3.2015, Pachod Police Station registered offence vide Crime No.I­30/2015 under Sections 279, 304­A, 337,338 against the driver of Tata Ace bearing registration No. MH­20­DE­2278 i.e. respondent No.1.

It was owned by respondent No.2 and was insured with respondent No.3. Therefore, respondent No.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to claimants. The claimants claimed compensation to the tune of Rs.20,00,000/­ 4 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. including the compensation under other conventional heads. 5.Respondent No.1 & 2 filed their Written Statement at Exh­13. They contended that the accident occurred due to fault of deceased and there was no fault, on the part of respondent No.1. They further contended that respondent No.1 was driving his vehicle in very slow and moderate speed.

They further denied the age and income of the deceased and submitted that the claim petition be rejected. 7.On rival pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed by me at Exh­16 and I record my findings against each of them for the reasons stated below.

He further submitted that on 27.2.2015 at about 00.30 hours the MLC in respect of said accident was recorded when the deceased was admitted to Ghati Hospital. He further submitted that Spot Panchnama was carried on 7 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. 27.2.2015 and the number of the said vehicle is mentioned in the spot panchanama. Therefore, it cannot be said that the vehicle is falsely involved in the accident. 12.The Learned advocate appearing for respondent No.3 submitted that the delay in filing the FIR is not explained by the claimants. CW3 examined by the claimant who was travelling with the deceased, has stated in his affidavit of evidence that the accident has occurred at about 10.45 p.m. but the MLC on record shows that the accident has taken place at 19.45 hours. He further submitted that CW3 eyewitness and person who was travelling as pillion rider on the motorcycle of deceased, has admitted in his cross examination that he was conscious when the accident happened. He has further admitted that he has not told the doctor that he has sustained injuries because of dash given by Tata AC. He has further submitted that it is the case of claimants that Tata AC gave dash to the motorcycle from behind but the pillion rider has not sustained any injury. He further submitted that all the parties are from same village. He further submitted that the statement of Nitin Rodge to whom the deceased has gone to meet in hospital, shows number of Tata AC which shows that the vehicle is falsely involved and implanted in the accident. He further submitted that the eyewitness Vikas Rodge was present while drawing the spot panchanama and he was also present for the funeral of deceased. A person cannot be present at two different 8 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. location at the same time. He submitted that it appears that the police papers are prepared in hands in gloves with the claimants, respondent and police persons. The material available on record clearly shows that the vehicle is falsely involved and implanted in the said accident and relied upon the following authorities. 1) New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs G.N.Gopalagowda & Anr. reported in 2007 STPL (Comp.) 304 Karnataka, 2) Dharamdev Vs Mohinder Singh & Ors. reported in 2008 STPL (Comp.) 442 HP. 3) Shivajirao Nilkanthrao Patil Vs Maruti Appa Tade (Deceased) through Legal heirs & Ors. reported in 2009 (6) AIR Bom.

Ltd vs Pawan Tikkiwal and Ors reported in 2007 (3) Rajasthan 2111, and submitted that the claim petition be rejected. 13.It is seen that FIR is lodged on 2.3.2015 in respect of said accident. MLC was registered on 27.2.2015 at about 00.30 hours. The MLC is at Exh­50. The Spot Panchanama at Exh­19 was carried out on 27.2.2015 at about 2.00 p.m. 9 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. The RW2­Investigating Officer has stated in his evidence that on 26.2.2015 he has received oral information about the accident. He has also admitted that from 26th February, 2015 till 2nd March, 2015 he has not recorded statement of any witness. CW3 in his affidavit has stated that after the accident, the deceased was first taken to Primary Health Center, Pachod. The deceased was not able to breath properly, hence he was taken to Ghati Hospital, Aurangabad for further treatment. He further deposed that he has not sustained any grievous injury in the accident. Hence, he was sent to his village. 14.Respondent No.2 has deposed in his affidavit of evidence at Exh­42 that there was no fault of his vehicle and the accident has happened because of negligency of deceased. In his cross examination, he has admitted that the accident had happened by his vehicle. He further admitted that his driver has informed him about the accident at about 12.00 midnight. At that time, he was in Pune. He further admitted that his driver has told him that he has given dash from the backside to the vehicle of deceased and his vehicle was damaged on the left side. The spot panchanama was carried on next day of the accident i.e. 27.2.2015. The registration number of offending vehicle is mentioned in the said panchanama. Therefore, it cannot be said that the offending vehicle has been implanted in the accident. The respondent No.1 driver of the offending vehicle has not stepped into witness­box, so as to rebut the testimony of claimant's 10 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. witness and the police papers on record. The testimony of CW3 clearly shows that the accident has happened because vehicle Tata AC bearing registration No.MH­20­DE­2278 has given dash from backside to the motorcycle of deceased. The evidence on record also shows that the driver of Tata AC was driving his vehicle in rash and negligent manner. 15.In New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs G.N.Gopalagowda, the FIR disclosed that the petitioner was riding scooter in rash and negligent manner and on the sampige road hit against tree, as a result, he fell down and sustained injuries. The FIR named the petitioner as accused of committing offence of rash and negligent driving. 16.In Dharamdev Vs Mohinder Singh & Ors., the FIR was lodged after six months of the accident and the record brought by the petitioner did not showed that he has suffered injuries because of motor vehicle accident. 17.Shivajirao Nilkanthrao Patil Vs Maruti Appa Tade, the accident had occurred on 7.8.1995 and report was lodged on 26.1.1998. 18.In Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs Kalawati and Ors., the vehicle involved in the accident was seized after six months and the statement of witnesses were recorded after one and half month. 19.In Gitaben Dineshbhai Thakkar Vs Musabhai Ahmedbhai Garasiya, the witness examined by the claimant was not trustworthy. 11 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. 20.In New India Assurance Company Ltd. Vs Laxman S/o Dadarao Karpe & Ors., the FIR stated that the case was of hit & run and the owner of the vehicle has taken the defence in his written statement that his vehicle was not involved in the accident. 21.In Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd. Through it's Branch Manager, 2nd Floor, Rajendra Chamber, Adalat Road, Aurangabad Vs Meera W/o Raju Chaudhary & Ors., the Investigating Officer has stated that he has learn from discrete source about involvement of vehicle but has not recorded statement of the person who has given the information. 22.In United India Insurance Co. Ltd vs Pawan Tikkiwal and Ors., the deceased and his son respondent No.1 met with an accident when their scooter slipped due to rough and bumpy road the father of respondent No.1 expired on 14.9.2000 and the respondent No.1 for the first time on 27.3.2001 has alleged that he was dashed by jeep. In the said case, there were two versions of respondent No.1. The facts of authorities relied by respondent No.3 are different from the facts of present case. Therefore, the authorities cited by respondent No.3 are not applicable to the present case in hand. The number of offending vehicle was mentioned in the spot panchanama at Exh­19 which was drawn on the second day of the incident. The delay in lodging FIR does not fatal the case of claimants as RW2 the Investigation Officer has deposed that at the time of carrying Spot 12 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. Panchanama, CW3 was present on the spot and was not in proper mental condition. He has further deposed that as the statement of witnesses were not recorded, he has not filed report. The time of accident mentioned in the MLC also does not fatal the case of claimants as the MLC is recorded as per the version of the person who has admitted the deceased in hospital and CW3 was not in the hospital at the time of admitting deceased in hospital. The claimant has examined eyewitness who was travelling with the deceased, at the time of accident. I do not find any reason so as to disbelieve the evidence adduced by the claimants. Hence, I answer Issue No.1 as 'Yes' and Issue No.2 & 2­A as 'No'. As to Issue No.3 : 23.CW1 in her deposition has stated that her husband was running flour mill and earning Rs.15,000/­ per month. He was also doing business of transportation and earning Rs.30,000/­ per month and was also earning Rs.5,00,000/­ per year from agriculture. 24.CW2 has brought on record the notebooks maintained by the deceased at Exh­38 & 39. CW3 has deposed in his cross examination that the entries made in the notebooks are made by deceased Ashok Raut. Bare perusal of the said notebooks shows that the entries are in different handwriting. Therefore, it cannot be said that the notebooks were maintained by the deceased in respect of account of his business of flour mill and transportation. There is 13 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. also no evidence on record to show that the deceased was earning Rs.5,00,000/­ from agriculture. In absence of any documentary evidence about income of deceased, it will be proper to take Rs.4,500/­ as notional income of deceased. Therefore, the annual income of the deceased will be Rs.54,000/­. It appears from the record that the deceased was having five dependents, at the time of accident. Therefore, 1/4th of his annual income is deducted as his personal expenses. His annual earning after deduction comes to Rs.40,500/­. 25.CW1 has deposed in her evidence that the age of her husband was 26 years, at the time of accident but has not filed any documentary proof in support of age of deceased. Therefore, the age mentioned in Inquest Panchanama and Postmortem Report is taken into consideration. The age of deceased is mentioned as 28 years in Postmortem Report as well as in Inquest Panchanama. Hence, the multiplier of 17 is applied to the present case as per the guidelines issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Smt. Sarla Verma Vs Delhi Transportation Corporation and another reported in AIR 2009 SC 3104 . Therefore, the loss of dependency comes to Rs.6,88,500/­. 26.The claimant No.1 has lost her husband, therefore, she is entitle to Rs.1,00,000/­ towards consortium. The claimant No.1 is also entitle for an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ towards loss of estate as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kalpanaraj & Ors. vs Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation, reported 14 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. in 2014 (5) Scale 479 . 27.Claimant No.2 & 3 have lost their father. Therefore, they are entitle to Rs.1,00,000/­ each towards love and affection as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Juju Kuruvila & Ors. Vs Kunjujamma Mohan & Others reported in (2013) 9 S.C.C. 166 . 28.Claimant No.4 & 5 have lost their son and therefore, they are entitle for Rs.50,000/­ each towards love and affection of their deceased son as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in M. Mansoor and Anr. Vs United India Insurance Co.Ltd., reported in 2013 12 Scale 324 . 29.The claimants are further entitle to an amount of Rs.25,000/­ towards funeral expenses of deceased. Therefore, the claimants are entitle for total compensation of Rs.12,13,500/­. 30.The claimants have received Rs.50,000/­ towards interim compensation under the head of No Fault Liability. Therefore, it will be appropriate to deduct the said amount from total compensation. After deducting the amount of interim compensation, the amount of compensation comes to Rs.11,63,500/­. 31.It is seen from Exh­17,18,23,24 & 25 that the offending vehicle was owned by respondent No.2, driven by respondent No.1 and insured with respondent No.3 at the time of accident. In such circumstances, respondent No.1 15 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to claimants for the death of deceased. 32.So far as rate of interest is concern, considering the period of pendency of matter and the amount of compensation, interest @ 7% per annum from the date of filing the petition, till realization of compensation amount would meet the ends of justice. Hence, I answer Issue No.3 accordingly and pass the following order. O R D E R 1.Petition is partly allowed. 2.The claimant No.1 to 5 are entitle to get compensation of Rs.12,13,500/­ inclusive of No Fault Liability. 3.Respondent No.1 to 3 do pay an amount of Rs.11,63,500/­ exclusive of No Fault Liability to claimant No.1 to 5 towards compensation jointly and severally along with interest @ 7% per annum, from the date of filing of petition, till realization of entire amount. 4.The compensation amount of Rs.11,63,500/­ be appropriated amongst claimant No.1 to 5 as under­ i) Claimant No.1 – Rs.3,32,700/­. ii) Claimant No.2 & 3 – Rs.2,32,700/­ each. iii) Claimant No.4 & 5 – Rs.1,82,700/­ each. 5.Out of compensation amount payable to claimant No.1, an amount of Rs.2,00,000/­ be invested in Fixed Deposit in her name, in any Nationalized Bank for the period of two years and remaining amount be paid to her by account payee cheque, on identification. 6.Compensation amount payable to claimant No.2 & 3 be invested in Fixed Deposit in their name, in any Nationalized Bank till they attains majority and claimant No.1 is at liberty to withdraw the amount of interest 16 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. quarterly, if she desire so. 7.Out of compensation amount payable to claimant No.4 & 5, an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ each be invested in Fixed Deposit in their name, in any Nationalized Bank for the period of one year and remaining amount be paid to them by account payee cheque, on identification. 8.Respondent No.1 to 3 do pay jointly and severally proportionate cost of the petition to claimants and bear their won cost. 9.Award be drawn accordingly.

He has further submitted that it is the case of claimants that Tata AC gave dash to the motorcycle from behind but the pillion rider has not sustained any injury. He further submitted that all the parties are from same village. He further submitted that the statement of Nitin Rodge to whom the deceased has gone to meet in hospital, shows number of Tata AC which shows that the vehicle is falsely involved and implanted in the accident. He further submitted that the eyewitness Vikas Rodge was present while drawing the spot panchanama and he was also present for the funeral of deceased. A person cannot be present at two different 8 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. location at the same time. He submitted that it appears that the police papers are prepared in hands in gloves with the claimants, respondent and police persons. The material available on record clearly shows that the vehicle is falsely involved and implanted in the said accident and relied upon the following authorities. 1) New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs G.N.Gopalagowda & Anr. reported in 2007 STPL (Comp.) 304 Karnataka, 2) Dharamdev Vs Mohinder Singh & Ors. reported in 2008 STPL (Comp.) 442 HP. 3) Shivajirao Nilkanthrao Patil Vs Maruti Appa Tade (Deceased) through Legal heirs & Ors. reported in 2009 (6) AIR Bom.

Ltd vs Pawan Tikkiwal and Ors reported in 2007 (3) Rajasthan 2111, and submitted that the claim petition be rejected. 13.It is seen that FIR is lodged on 2.3.2015 in respect of said accident. MLC was registered on 27.2.2015 at about 00.30 hours. The MLC is at Exh­50. The Spot Panchanama at Exh­19 was carried out on 27.2.2015 at about 2.00 p.m. 9 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. The RW2­Investigating Officer has stated in his evidence that on 26.2.2015 he has received oral information about the accident. He has also admitted that from 26th February, 2015 till 2nd March, 2015 he has not recorded statement of any witness. CW3 in his affidavit has stated that after the accident, the deceased was first taken to Primary Health Center, Pachod. The deceased was not able to breath properly, hence he was taken to Ghati Hospital, Aurangabad for further treatment. He further deposed that he has not sustained any grievous injury in the accident. Hence, he was sent to his village. 14.Respondent No.2 has deposed in his affidavit of evidence at Exh­42 that there was no fault of his vehicle and the accident has happened because of negligency of deceased. In his cross examination, he has admitted that the accident had happened by his vehicle. He further admitted that his driver has informed him about the accident at about 12.00 midnight. At that time, he was in Pune. He further admitted that his driver has told him that he has given dash from the backside to the vehicle of deceased and his vehicle was damaged on the left side. The spot panchanama was carried on next day of the accident i.e. 27.2.2015. The registration number of offending vehicle is mentioned in the said panchanama. Therefore, it cannot be said that the offending vehicle has been implanted in the accident. The respondent No.1 driver of the offending vehicle has not stepped into witness­box, so as to rebut the testimony of claimant's 10 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. witness and the police papers on record. The testimony of CW3 clearly shows that the accident has happened because vehicle Tata AC bearing registration No.MH­20­DE­2278 has given dash from backside to the motorcycle of deceased. The evidence on record also shows that the driver of Tata AC was driving his vehicle in rash and negligent manner. 15.In New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs G.N.Gopalagowda, the FIR disclosed that the petitioner was riding scooter in rash and negligent manner and on the sampige road hit against tree, as a result, he fell down and sustained injuries. The FIR named the petitioner as accused of committing offence of rash and negligent driving. 16.In Dharamdev Vs Mohinder Singh & Ors., the FIR was lodged after six months of the accident and the record brought by the petitioner did not showed that he has suffered injuries because of motor vehicle accident. 17.Shivajirao Nilkanthrao Patil Vs Maruti Appa Tade, the accident had occurred on 7.8.1995 and report was lodged on 26.1.1998. 18.In Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs Kalawati and Ors., the vehicle involved in the accident was seized after six months and the statement of witnesses were recorded after one and half month. 19.In Gitaben Dineshbhai Thakkar Vs Musabhai Ahmedbhai Garasiya, the witness examined by the claimant was not trustworthy. 11 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. 20.In New India Assurance Company Ltd. Vs Laxman S/o Dadarao Karpe & Ors., the FIR stated that the case was of hit & run and the owner of the vehicle has taken the defence in his written statement that his vehicle was not involved in the accident. 21.In Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Co. Ltd. Through it's Branch Manager, 2nd Floor, Rajendra Chamber, Adalat Road, Aurangabad Vs Meera W/o Raju Chaudhary & Ors., the Investigating Officer has stated that he has learn from discrete source about involvement of vehicle but has not recorded statement of the person who has given the information. 22.In United India Insurance Co. Ltd vs Pawan Tikkiwal and Ors., the deceased and his son respondent No.1 met with an accident when their scooter slipped due to rough and bumpy road the father of respondent No.1 expired on 14.9.2000 and the respondent No.1 for the first time on 27.3.2001 has alleged that he was dashed by jeep. In the said case, there were two versions of respondent No.1. The facts of authorities relied by respondent No.3 are different from the facts of present case. Therefore, the authorities cited by respondent No.3 are not applicable to the present case in hand. The number of offending vehicle was mentioned in the spot panchanama at Exh­19 which was drawn on the second day of the incident. The delay in lodging FIR does not fatal the case of claimants as RW2 the Investigation Officer has deposed that at the time of carrying Spot 12 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. Panchanama, CW3 was present on the spot and was not in proper mental condition. He has further deposed that as the statement of witnesses were not recorded, he has not filed report. The time of accident mentioned in the MLC also does not fatal the case of claimants as the MLC is recorded as per the version of the person who has admitted the deceased in hospital and CW3 was not in the hospital at the time of admitting deceased in hospital. The claimant has examined eyewitness who was travelling with the deceased, at the time of accident. I do not find any reason so as to disbelieve the evidence adduced by the claimants. Hence, I answer Issue No.1 as 'Yes' and Issue No.2 & 2­A as 'No'. As to Issue No.3 : 23.CW1 in her deposition has stated that her husband was running flour mill and earning Rs.15,000/­ per month. He was also doing business of transportation and earning Rs.30,000/­ per month and was also earning Rs.5,00,000/­ per year from agriculture. 24.CW2 has brought on record the notebooks maintained by the deceased at Exh­38 & 39. CW3 has deposed in his cross examination that the entries made in the notebooks are made by deceased Ashok Raut. Bare perusal of the said notebooks shows that the entries are in different handwriting. Therefore, it cannot be said that the notebooks were maintained by the deceased in respect of account of his business of flour mill and transportation. There is 13 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. also no evidence on record to show that the deceased was earning Rs.5,00,000/­ from agriculture. In absence of any documentary evidence about income of deceased, it will be proper to take Rs.4,500/­ as notional income of deceased. Therefore, the annual income of the deceased will be Rs.54,000/­. It appears from the record that the deceased was having five dependents, at the time of accident. Therefore, 1/4th of his annual income is deducted as his personal expenses. His annual earning after deduction comes to Rs.40,500/­. 25.CW1 has deposed in her evidence that the age of her husband was 26 years, at the time of accident but has not filed any documentary proof in support of age of deceased. Therefore, the age mentioned in Inquest Panchanama and Postmortem Report is taken into consideration. The age of deceased is mentioned as 28 years in Postmortem Report as well as in Inquest Panchanama. Hence, the multiplier of 17 is applied to the present case as per the guidelines issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Smt. Sarla Verma Vs Delhi Transportation Corporation and another reported in AIR 2009 SC 3104 . Therefore, the loss of dependency comes to Rs.6,88,500/­. 26.The claimant No.1 has lost her husband, therefore, she is entitle to Rs.1,00,000/­ towards consortium. The claimant No.1 is also entitle for an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ towards loss of estate as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kalpanaraj & Ors. vs Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation, reported 14 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. in 2014 (5) Scale 479 . 27.Claimant No.2 & 3 have lost their father. Therefore, they are entitle to Rs.1,00,000/­ each towards love and affection as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Juju Kuruvila & Ors. Vs Kunjujamma Mohan & Others reported in (2013) 9 S.C.C. 166 . 28.Claimant No.4 & 5 have lost their son and therefore, they are entitle for Rs.50,000/­ each towards love and affection of their deceased son as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in M. Mansoor and Anr. Vs United India Insurance Co.Ltd., reported in 2013 12 Scale 324 . 29.The claimants are further entitle to an amount of Rs.25,000/­ towards funeral expenses of deceased. Therefore, the claimants are entitle for total compensation of Rs.12,13,500/­. 30.The claimants have received Rs.50,000/­ towards interim compensation under the head of No Fault Liability. Therefore, it will be appropriate to deduct the said amount from total compensation. After deducting the amount of interim compensation, the amount of compensation comes to Rs.11,63,500/­. 31.It is seen from Exh­17,18,23,24 & 25 that the offending vehicle was owned by respondent No.2, driven by respondent No.1 and insured with respondent No.3 at the time of accident. In such circumstances, respondent No.1 15 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to claimants for the death of deceased. 32.So far as rate of interest is concern, considering the period of pendency of matter and the amount of compensation, interest @ 7% per annum from the date of filing the petition, till realization of compensation amount would meet the ends of justice. Hence, I answer Issue No.3 accordingly and pass the following order. O R D E R 1.Petition is partly allowed. 2.The claimant No.1 to 5 are entitle to get compensation of Rs.12,13,500/­ inclusive of No Fault Liability. 3.Respondent No.1 to 3 do pay an amount of Rs.11,63,500/­ exclusive of No Fault Liability to claimant No.1 to 5 towards compensation jointly and severally along with interest @ 7% per annum, from the date of filing of petition, till realization of entire amount. 4.The compensation amount of Rs.11,63,500/­ be appropriated amongst claimant No.1 to 5 as under­ i) Claimant No.1 – Rs.3,32,700/­. ii) Claimant No.2 & 3 – Rs.2,32,700/­ each. iii) Claimant No.4 & 5 – Rs.1,82,700/­ each. 5.Out of compensation amount payable to claimant No.1, an amount of Rs.2,00,000/­ be invested in Fixed Deposit in her name, in any Nationalized Bank for the period of two years and remaining amount be paid to her by account payee cheque, on identification. 6.Compensation amount payable to claimant No.2 & 3 be invested in Fixed Deposit in their name, in any Nationalized Bank till they attains majority and claimant No.1 is at liberty to withdraw the amount of interest 16 M.A.C.P.No.776/2015, [Judgment]. quarterly, if she desire so. 7.Out of compensation amount payable to claimant No.4 & 5, an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ each be invested in Fixed Deposit in their name, in any Nationalized Bank for the period of one year and remaining amount be paid to them by account payee cheque, on identification. 8.Respondent No.1 to 3 do pay jointly and severally proportionate cost of the petition to claimants and bear their won cost. 9.Award be drawn accordingly.

A.Z.Biyabani for claimants Advocate Shri. U.I.Thole for r espondent No.1 and 3. Advocate Shri. S.G.Chapalgaonkar for respondent No.2. **************************************************** J U D G M E N T [Delivered on this 07th day of March, 2018] 01.The claimants have filed the claim petition u/s 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act for claiming compensation amounting to Rs.35,00,000/­ against the respondents. 02.In brief, the facts of the claimants case can be summarized as follows :­ It is the case of the claimants that on 16.07.2015 at about 06.30 hours on Aurangabad­Sillod road near Ajintha village, deceased Sandeep Gaikwad was traveling by cement container vehicle No. MH­ 26­H­7565 (hereinafter referred to as offending vehicle). The deceased Sandeep Gaikwad was engaged for loading and unloading the cement bag of the offending vehicle. When the offending vehicle reached near Ajintha village, its driver respondent No.3 drove the same in rash and Lilabai & ors. Vs. Gurvindarsingh & Otrs. Judgment – MACP No.617/2015 (( 3 )) negligent manner in high speed and gave dash to truck No. AP­16­TB­ 5675. Due to the accident deceased Sandeep Gaikwad succumbed to the injuries on the spot. Claimant No.1 Lilabai is mother, No.2 Manohar is minor younger brother and No.3 Anita is real sister of deceased Sandeep Gaikwad. 03.The concerned medical officer performed postmortem on the dead body of deceased Sandeep Gaikwad. The crime No.I­95/2015 u/s 304­A, 279, 337, 338, 427 of the Indian Penal code has been registered against the driver of the offending vehicle i.e. respondent No.3. 04.The respondent No.1 is registered owner of the offending vehicle while it was insured with respondent No.2 Insurance Company on the date of accident. The deceased Sandeep Gaikwad was 20 years old and earning Rs.15,000/­ per month on the date of accident. As such, claimants being dependents of the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad have filed this claim petition against the respondents and claimed compensation of Rs.35,00,000/­ towards the compensation. Lastly claimants prayed for allowing the claim with 18% interest. 05.The respondent No.1 and 3 appeared but failed to file their written statement on record. As such, the claim proceeded without written statement against the respondent No.1 and 3. 4 06.The respondent No.2 Insurance Company have filed its detailed written statement at Exh.­13 and resisted the claim by denying each and everything pleaded by the claimants including age and income of the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad. The respondent No.2 Insurance Company also denied the alleged act of rash and negligent driving at the hands of respondent No.3 at the time of alleged accident. 07.According to the respondent No.2 Insurance Company the claimants have failed to implead driver, owner and insurer of the truck bearing No. AP­16­TB­5675 in the present claim which was involved in the alleged accident. According to the respondent No.2 Insurance Company, the owner, driver and insurer of another vehicle truck bearing No. AP­16­TB­5675 are the necessary parties to the present claim, therefore, claim deserves to be rejected for want to impleading necessary parties. The respondent No.2 Insurance Company taken defence that it is the case of contributory negligence. Lastly respondent No.2 Insurance Company prayed for rejecting the claim. 08.Considering pleadings of the claimants and respondents I have framed issues vide Exh.­15 which are being reproduced as follows and I record my findings with reasons thereon as follows :­ Lilabai & ors. Vs. Gurvindarsingh & Otrs. Judgment – MACP No.617/2015 (( 5 )) ISSUES FINDINGS 1]Whether due to rash and negligent driving of motor vehicle bearing registration No. MH­26­H­7565 the accident occurred and as a consequence thereof, the deceased Sandeep @ Sone Devidas Gaikwad died? In the affirmative 2]Whether the claimants are entitled to get compensation? If yes, what should be the quantum ?As per final order 3]Who is liable to pay compensation? As per final order 4]What order and award? As per final order. R E A S O N S 09.Perused record and proceedings carefully. Heard learned counsel Shri. A.Z.Biyabani for the claimant, as well as, learned counsel Shri.S.G.Chapalgaonkar for the respondent No.2 Insurance Company. No response from rest of the respondents. 10.The claimant side relied on the following rulings 1.Ramrao Lala Borse Vs. New India Assurance Company Ltd reported in LEX (SC) 2018 1 16. 2.United India Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Maimuna wd/o Shaikh Ateeq Tamboli and others, Judgment of Hon'ble High Court of Judicature of Bombay in First Appeal No.1633/2017, decided on 11.01.2018 . 3.Lalita Devi and others Vs. Karambir and Another reported in 2014(2) T.A.C.37 (Del.). I have gone through the aforesaid rulings carefully and 6 considered as guideline for me to decide the claim petition. AS TO ISSUE NO.1 :­ 11.Prior to appreciation of oral and documentary evidence adduced by the parties I must refer the following rulings :­ (1)The Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of United India Insurance Company Ltd Vs. Sayaji, reported in LAWS (BOM) 2008­8­223 has observed that :­ “Since the motor accident tribunal is the tribunal, strict rule of the Evidence Act not applicable and tribunal can very well consider what was the case made out before the police after the incident. This Court can take into consideration the certified copies of various documents on record. The certified copy of F.I.R., spot panchanama and inquest panchanama can be read in evidence without any additional proof”. (2)Further the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of N.K.V.Brothers Pvt. Ltd. Vs. M. Karunamai Ammal, reported in 1980 ACJ 345 (S.C.) has held that :­ “The accident claim tribunal must take special care to see that innocent victim do not suffer and drivers and owners do not escape from liability merely because of some doubts here or some obscurity there. The Court should not succumb to niceties, technicalities and mystic maybes.” Lilabai & ors. Vs. Gurvindarsingh & Otrs. Judgment – MACP No.617/2015 (( 7 )) 12.Admittedly, respondent No.1 is owner, respondent No.3 driver and respondent No.2 is insurer of the offending vehicle vide insurance policy Exh.­43 standing in the name of Gurvindarsingh for the period from 01.04.2015 to 31.03.2016 and accident occurred on 16.07.2015. As such, it covers the risk of accident on the date of accident. It is also not disputed that the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad had expired in the accident vide inquest panchanama Exh.­47, police report Exh.­48 and postmortem report Exh.­49. 13.The claimant No.1 Lilabai Devidas Gaikwad Exh.­37 has led her oral evidence being dependent of the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad. She is real mother of the deceased. She categorically deposed on oath and narrated the entire incident of accident as pleaded in Exh.­1. In fact, she is not eye witness of the incident. She is coming before the court as a witness on behalf of the claimants and real mother of the deceased. 14.The police case papers F.I.R. Exh.­38 & 45, charge­sheet Exh.­46, inquest panchanama Exh.­47, postmortem report Exyh.­49 goes to prove that the accident took place and deceased Sandeep Gaikwad died due to the accident. No doubt, respondent No.3 who is driving the offending vehicle on the date of accident, has been charge­sheeted by the police authority for rash and negligent driving vide charge­sheet Exh.­46. Hence, it is proved that respondent No.3 was driving the offending vehicle in rash and negligent manner and held responsible for the death 8 of deceased Sandeep Gaikwad. As such, issue No.1 proved, hence I answer the same in affirmative. AS TO ISSUES NO.2 AND 3 :­ 15.The learned counsel for the respondent No.2 Insurance Company vehemently argued that deceased Sandeep Gaikwad was traveling as a passenger in the offending vehicle. As such, there is breach of terms and conditions of insurance policy, as in the goods vehicle passenger cannot be carried and travel. Hence, he submitted that claimants are not entitled to claim compensation. However, in this respect there is no evidence on record. On the other hand in FIR it is clearly mentioned that deceased Sandeep Gaikwad was the cleaner on the offending vehicle. Therefore, I am not in agreement with the arguments of learned counsel of respondent No.2 Insurance Company. 16.It is proved that deceased Sandeep Gaikwad had expired in the accident. The postmortem report vide Exh.­49 and inquest panchanama Exh.­47 goes to prove that the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad died in the accident. As such, claimants are entitled to claim the compensation amount. 17.Now so as to ascertain and determine the compensation amount, the tribunal has to consider the age and income of the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad. According to the claimants on the date of accident the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad was 20 years old. However, the inquest Lilabai & ors. Vs. Gurvindarsingh & Otrs. Judgment – MACP No.617/2015 (( 9 )) panchanama Exh.­47 and postmortem report Exh.­49 goes to prove that on the date of accident the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad was 18 years old. In the circumstances, as per ruling of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sarla Varma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another, 2009(2) T.A.C. 677 (S.C.) the multiplier 18 can be applied to this case. 18.Now so as to determine income of the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad the FIR Exh.­45 shows that he was working as cleaner on the offending vehicle. It is the contention of claimants that the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad was earning Rs.15,000/­ per month. But in fact there is no proof to hold that the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad was earning Rs.15,000/­ per month as cleaner on the offending vehicle. In such circumstances I have no alternative than to consider the notional income of Rs.4,500/­ per month as per the ruling of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ramchandrappa Vs. Manager, Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Company Ltd., reported in 2011(4) T.A.C. (1) (S.C.) . In the circumstances the calculation would be as follows :­ Rs.4,500 X 12 X 18 = Rs.9,72,000/­ 19.The deceased Sandeep Gaikwad was bachelor at the time of accident. As such, 50% deductions should be considered towards the personal and living expenses of the deceased as per the observations of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sarla Varma and others Vs. Delhi 10 Transport Corporation and another, 2009(2) T.A.C. 677 (S.C.). Therefore, claimant are entitled for 50% of Rs.9,72,000/­ which comes to Rs.4,86,000/­ towards loss of dependency. 20.The deceased Sandeep Gaikwad died bachelor, therefore, as per the observations of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and Ors., Special Leave Petition (Civil) 25590/2014 dated 31.10.2017 . the claimants are entitled for Rs.15,000/­ towards funeral expenses and Rs.15,000/­ towards loss of estate. As such, claimants are entitled for compensation as follows. Rs. 4,86,000/­ Towards loss of dependency Rs. 15,000/­ Towards funeral expenses. Rs. 15,000/­ Towards loss of estate. ========================================== Rs. 5,16,000/­ Total compensation ========================================== 21.As such claimants are entitled for total compensation of Rs.5,16,000/­ and respondent No.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the same with 9% interest from the date of filing of this petition i.e. 21.09.2015 till its full realization as per the observations of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Smt. Neeta w/o Kallappa Kadolkar and others Vs. The Divisional Manager, MSRTC, Kolhapur reported in 2015(1) T.A.C.340 (S.C.). 22.The claimants are failed to prove fixed and permanent Lilabai & ors. Vs. Gurvindarsingh & Otrs. Judgment – MACP No.617/2015 (( 11 )) income of the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad. Therefore, question does not arise to add the additional income towards future prospects. Furthermore, it is hereby clear that the sister of deceased Sandeep Gaikwad i.e. claimant No.3 Anita Surase cannot be considered as dependent on the deceased because she is major and married woman. Therefore, it is hereby held that claimant No.1 and 2 only are entitled for the total compensation of Rs.5,16,000/­. Accordingly issue No.2 and 3 proved, hence I answer the same in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO.4 :­ 23.In view of findings given to aforesaid issues, the claim of the claimant deserves to be allowed partly with proportionate costs as against the respondents. In the circumstances, respondent No.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay total compensation of Rs.5,16,000/­ to the claimant No.1 and 2 with 9% interest from the date of filing petition i.e 21.09.2015 till its full realization. It is hereby made it clear that claimant No.3 is the married sister of deceased. She cannot be considered as dependents of deceased being major and married sister. Therefore, no part of compensation amount is awarded to her. In the circumstances I proceed to pass the following order. ORDER 1]The claim of the claimants is hereby allowed partly with proportionate costs as follows :­ 12 2]Respondent Nos.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation amount of Rs.5,16,000/­ (Rupees Five Lacs Sixteen Thousand Only) with 9% interest to the claimant No.1 and 2 only from the date of filing of this petition i.e. 21.09.2015 till its realization, including NFL amount of Rs.50,000/­. 3]Aforesaid compensation amount be apportioned amongst the claimants as follows :­ Claimant No.1 ­Rs.4,16,000/­ Claimant No.2 ­ Rs.1,00,000/­ by account payee cheques. 4]The compensation amount of minor claimant No.2 of Rs.1,00,000/­ (Rs. One Lack Only) be invested in fixed deposit scheme of any nationalized bank as per choise of claimant No.1 till he attains the majority and its interest be credited to the account of claimant no.1 with quarterly rest. 5]It is hereby made it clear that claimant No.3 being major and married sister of deceased Sandeep Gaikwad is not entitled for compensation amount in this case. 6]Award be prepared accordingly. 7]Order pronounced in open Court.

Claim:­ Compensation of Rs.7,00,000/­under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act. ================================= Mr A. P. Gunge, Advocate for the Claimants. Mr F. R. Shaikh, Advocate for the Respondents. ================================= JUDGMENT ( Delivered in open Court on 14.03.2016 ) 1)This is fatal accident claim. Petitioners claim compensation of Rs.7,00,000/­ under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act on account of death of Ramesh Trimbak Mule, husband of petitioner No.1, father of petitioner Nos.2 to 4 and son of petitioner No.5 in motor vehicular accident. 2)Briefly stated petitioners' case is that on 13.12.2014 at about 3.15 p.m. deceased Ramesh Trimbak Mule went to Pirbawada bus stand for his work. At that time S.T. Bus bearing No.MH­40­8002 Aurangabad to Rajur driven by its driver in very high speed and in rash and negligent manner and it gave dash to deceased due to which deceased sustained injuries to his both legs, left hand. He was immediately shifted to Rural Hospital, Phulambri where doctor examined and declared dead. Thereafter postmortem was performed on his body. 3)In respect of the accident Police Station, [ 3 ] Judgment in M. A. C. P. No.63/2015 Sumitra & Ors. Vs. Shaikh Kadu & Anr Wadodbazar registered the offence under crime No.I­151/2014 against the driver of the said bus under sections 279, 304­A, 338 of I. P. C. As such the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of said bus bearing No. MH­40­8002 by its driver and he is solely responsible for the accident. Respondent No.1 is the driver of said bus. Respondent No.2 is owner of said bus. At the time of death deceased was 40 years of old. He was doing meson work and earning Rs.500/­ per day. The petitioners were dependent on his income. Hence, petitioners have filed this claim and demanded compensation of Rs.7,00,000/­ from the respondents jointly and severally. 4)Respondent Nos.1 and 2 filed written statement (Exhibit 11) and categorically denied the allegations in respect of the age, occupation of the deceased and the manner in which accident occurred. They denied that said accident took place due to negligence of said bus driver. 5)Following issues were framed at Exhibit 13. I reproduced the issues alongwith my findings thereon for the reasons to follow as under. ISSUES FINDINGS 1)Whether the petitioners prove that the deceased died in the motor vehicular accident dated 13.12.2014 ?:­In the affirmative. [ 4 ] Judgment in M. A. C. P. No.63/2015 Sumitra & Ors. Vs. Shaikh Kadu & Anr 2)Whether petitioners prove that the deceased died in the accident due to rash and negligent driving of S.T. Bus bearing No.MH­40­8002 which is owned by respondent No.2 ?:­In the affirmative. 3)What is just and reasonable amount of compensation and against whom it is to be awarded ?:Rs.7,80,000/­ jointly and severally from respondent Nos.1 and 2. 4)What order and award ? :As per final order. Reasons Issue Nos.1 to 3:­ 6)In order to substantiate the claim the petitioner No.1 Sumitra Mule widow of deceased has examined herself and produced certain documents. Respondent Nos.1 and 2 have not adduced evidence of respondent No.1 who was driver of the said bus at the time of accident. 7)Undisputedly, the accident occurred on 13.12.2014 at 3.15 p.m. on S.T. Bus Stand of village Pirbawada, Tq. Phulambri, District Aurangabad. At the time of accident said bus was proceeding from Aurangabad to Rajur from left side of the road. At the time of recording spot panchnama panch witnesses had seen that at the spot of accident blood was lying. The accident happened on the tar road. At the spot of accident Phulambri to Rajur road passes in east­west direction. To the [ 5 ] Judgment in M. A. C. P. No.63/2015 Sumitra & Ors. Vs. Shaikh Kadu & Anr southern side there is old bus stand of Pirbawada. To the northern side there is tin shed of Shaikh Atik. These circumstances prevailing at the spot of accident duly prove that while driving the said bus along the public road, the respondent no.1 bus driver did not pay proper attention to the traffic on the road and gave dash to the deceased who was pedestrian while driving said bus in rash and negligent manner. Nothing came on record to show that deceased was negligently walking along the road. Copy of inquest panchnama is filed at Exh.17 and postmortem report is filed at Exh.18. Deceased died due to shock due to multiple injuries. 8)In cross­examination of petitioner no.1 it was suggested that at the time of death deceased was more than 50 years of age but she flatly denied that suggestion. In this case petitioners did not produce any document as to age of deceased. In inquest panchnama and postmortem report age of the deceased is shown as 40 years. 9)Petitioner no.1 in her affidavit in lieu of evidence stated that at the time of death deceased was working as meson and was earning Rs.500/­ per day i.e. Rs.15000/­ per month. He was maintaining himself and to them. They were fully dependent upon his income. Except her bare words there is no evidence that deceased was working as meson and earning [ 6 ] Judgment in M. A. C. P. No.63/2015 Sumitra & Ors. Vs. Shaikh Kadu & Anr Rs.500/­ per day. To prove this fact the contractor with whom deceased was working or owner of the house whose construction work is undertaken by him or co­worker of deceased were not examined by the petitioners. Under these circumstances for want of sufficient evidence I hold that notional income of deceased was Rs.3000/­ per month. In case of Smt. Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation reported in AIR 2009 Supreme Court page 3104 Honourable Apex Court held that if the number of dependents in the family of deceased is large, in the absence of specific evidence in regard to contribution to the family, the Court may adopt the unit method for arriving at the contribution of the deceased to his family. Total number of units are to be determined and then the income is divided by number of units. When there are four members in the family of deceased depending on him, the deduction towards personal and living expenses of the deceased would be 1/4th where the number of dependent family members is 4 to 6. The ratio laid down in that case is squarely applicable to the present case. There were five persons in the family of deceased dependent upon his income. Therefore, from the said notional income of deceased 1/4th amount is liable to be deducted towards his personal expenses. That amount comes to Rs.750/­. So at the time of accident deceased was aged 40 years. As such the multiplier to be applied to the age group of 36 years but not exceeding 40 years [ 7 ] Judgment in M. A. C. P. No.63/2015 Sumitra & Ors. Vs. Shaikh Kadu & Anr given in case of Smt. Sarla Verma (cited supra) is 15. 10)Considering the monthly notional income of the deceased at Rs.3,000/­, his yearly income comes to Rs.36,000/­. By deducting 1/4th towards his personal expenses, his loss of dependency and prospective and future loss comes to Rs.4,05,000/­. Petitioners are also entitled to get Rs.25,000/­ towards funeral expenses. Petitioner No.1 is also entitled to get Rs.1,00,000/­ towards amount of consortium. Petitioners are also entitled to get Rs.50,000/­each total Rs.2,50,000/­ towards love and affection. Thus, total amount of compensation comes to Rs.4,05,000/­+ Rs.2,50,000/­+ Rs.25,000/­ + Rs.1,00,000/­ = Rs.7,80,000/­. The petitioners have restricted their claim to Rs.7,00,000/­.

A.Z.Biyabani for claimants Advocate Shri. U.I.Thole for r espondent No.1 and 3. Advocate Shri. S.G.Chapalgaonkar for respondent No.2. **************************************************** J U D G M E N T [Delivered on this 07th day of March, 2018] 01.The claimants have filed the claim petition u/s 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act for claiming compensation amounting to Rs.35,00,000/­ against the respondents. 02.In brief, the facts of the claimants case can be summarized as follows :­ It is the case of the claimants that on 16.07.2015 at about 06.30 hours on Aurangabad­Sillod road near Ajintha village, deceased Sandeep Gaikwad was traveling by cement container vehicle No. MH­ 26­H­7565 (hereinafter referred to as offending vehicle). The deceased Sandeep Gaikwad was engaged for loading and unloading the cement bag of the offending vehicle. When the offending vehicle reached near Ajintha village, its driver respondent No.3 drove the same in rash and Lilabai & ors. Vs. Gurvindarsingh & Otrs. Judgment – MACP No.617/2015 (( 3 )) negligent manner in high speed and gave dash to truck No. AP­16­TB­ 5675. Due to the accident deceased Sandeep Gaikwad succumbed to the injuries on the spot. Claimant No.1 Lilabai is mother, No.2 Manohar is minor younger brother and No.3 Anita is real sister of deceased Sandeep Gaikwad. 03.The concerned medical officer performed postmortem on the dead body of deceased Sandeep Gaikwad. The crime No.I­95/2015 u/s 304­A, 279, 337, 338, 427 of the Indian Penal code has been registered against the driver of the offending vehicle i.e. respondent No.3. 04.The respondent No.1 is registered owner of the offending vehicle while it was insured with respondent No.2 Insurance Company on the date of accident. The deceased Sandeep Gaikwad was 20 years old and earning Rs.15,000/­ per month on the date of accident. As such, claimants being dependents of the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad have filed this claim petition against the respondents and claimed compensation of Rs.35,00,000/­ towards the compensation. Lastly claimants prayed for allowing the claim with 18% interest. 05.The respondent No.1 and 3 appeared but failed to file their written statement on record. As such, the claim proceeded without written statement against the respondent No.1 and 3. 4 06.The respondent No.2 Insurance Company have filed its detailed written statement at Exh.­13 and resisted the claim by denying each and everything pleaded by the claimants including age and income of the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad. The respondent No.2 Insurance Company also denied the alleged act of rash and negligent driving at the hands of respondent No.3 at the time of alleged accident. 07.According to the respondent No.2 Insurance Company the claimants have failed to implead driver, owner and insurer of the truck bearing No. AP­16­TB­5675 in the present claim which was involved in the alleged accident. According to the respondent No.2 Insurance Company, the owner, driver and insurer of another vehicle truck bearing No. AP­16­TB­5675 are the necessary parties to the present claim, therefore, claim deserves to be rejected for want to impleading necessary parties. The respondent No.2 Insurance Company taken defence that it is the case of contributory negligence. Lastly respondent No.2 Insurance Company prayed for rejecting the claim. 08.Considering pleadings of the claimants and respondents I have framed issues vide Exh.­15 which are being reproduced as follows and I record my findings with reasons thereon as follows :­ Lilabai & ors. Vs. Gurvindarsingh & Otrs. Judgment – MACP No.617/2015 (( 5 )) ISSUES FINDINGS 1]Whether due to rash and negligent driving of motor vehicle bearing registration No. MH­26­H­7565 the accident occurred and as a consequence thereof, the deceased Sandeep @ Sone Devidas Gaikwad died? In the affirmative 2]Whether the claimants are entitled to get compensation? If yes, what should be the quantum ?As per final order 3]Who is liable to pay compensation? As per final order 4]What order and award? As per final order. R E A S O N S 09.Perused record and proceedings carefully. Heard learned counsel Shri. A.Z.Biyabani for the claimant, as well as, learned counsel Shri.S.G.Chapalgaonkar for the respondent No.2 Insurance Company. No response from rest of the respondents. 10.The claimant side relied on the following rulings 1.Ramrao Lala Borse Vs. New India Assurance Company Ltd reported in LEX (SC) 2018 1 16. 2.United India Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Maimuna wd/o Shaikh Ateeq Tamboli and others, Judgment of Hon'ble High Court of Judicature of Bombay in First Appeal No.1633/2017, decided on 11.01.2018 . 3.Lalita Devi and others Vs. Karambir and Another reported in 2014(2) T.A.C.37 (Del.). I have gone through the aforesaid rulings carefully and 6 considered as guideline for me to decide the claim petition. AS TO ISSUE NO.1 :­ 11.Prior to appreciation of oral and documentary evidence adduced by the parties I must refer the following rulings :­ (1)The Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of United India Insurance Company Ltd Vs. Sayaji, reported in LAWS (BOM) 2008­8­223 has observed that :­ “Since the motor accident tribunal is the tribunal, strict rule of the Evidence Act not applicable and tribunal can very well consider what was the case made out before the police after the incident. This Court can take into consideration the certified copies of various documents on record. The certified copy of F.I.R., spot panchanama and inquest panchanama can be read in evidence without any additional proof”. (2)Further the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of N.K.V.Brothers Pvt. Ltd. Vs. M. Karunamai Ammal, reported in 1980 ACJ 345 (S.C.) has held that :­ “The accident claim tribunal must take special care to see that innocent victim do not suffer and drivers and owners do not escape from liability merely because of some doubts here or some obscurity there. The Court should not succumb to niceties, technicalities and mystic maybes.” Lilabai & ors. Vs. Gurvindarsingh & Otrs. Judgment – MACP No.617/2015 (( 7 )) 12.Admittedly, respondent No.1 is owner, respondent No.3 driver and respondent No.2 is insurer of the offending vehicle vide insurance policy Exh.­43 standing in the name of Gurvindarsingh for the period from 01.04.2015 to 31.03.2016 and accident occurred on 16.07.2015. As such, it covers the risk of accident on the date of accident. It is also not disputed that the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad had expired in the accident vide inquest panchanama Exh.­47, police report Exh.­48 and postmortem report Exh.­49. 13.The claimant No.1 Lilabai Devidas Gaikwad Exh.­37 has led her oral evidence being dependent of the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad. She is real mother of the deceased. She categorically deposed on oath and narrated the entire incident of accident as pleaded in Exh.­1. In fact, she is not eye witness of the incident. She is coming before the court as a witness on behalf of the claimants and real mother of the deceased. 14.The police case papers F.I.R. Exh.­38 & 45, charge­sheet Exh.­46, inquest panchanama Exh.­47, postmortem report Exyh.­49 goes to prove that the accident took place and deceased Sandeep Gaikwad died due to the accident. No doubt, respondent No.3 who is driving the offending vehicle on the date of accident, has been charge­sheeted by the police authority for rash and negligent driving vide charge­sheet Exh.­46. Hence, it is proved that respondent No.3 was driving the offending vehicle in rash and negligent manner and held responsible for the death 8 of deceased Sandeep Gaikwad. As such, issue No.1 proved, hence I answer the same in affirmative. AS TO ISSUES NO.2 AND 3 :­ 15.The learned counsel for the respondent No.2 Insurance Company vehemently argued that deceased Sandeep Gaikwad was traveling as a passenger in the offending vehicle. As such, there is breach of terms and conditions of insurance policy, as in the goods vehicle passenger cannot be carried and travel. Hence, he submitted that claimants are not entitled to claim compensation. However, in this respect there is no evidence on record. On the other hand in FIR it is clearly mentioned that deceased Sandeep Gaikwad was the cleaner on the offending vehicle. Therefore, I am not in agreement with the arguments of learned counsel of respondent No.2 Insurance Company. 16.It is proved that deceased Sandeep Gaikwad had expired in the accident. The postmortem report vide Exh.­49 and inquest panchanama Exh.­47 goes to prove that the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad died in the accident. As such, claimants are entitled to claim the compensation amount. 17.Now so as to ascertain and determine the compensation amount, the tribunal has to consider the age and income of the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad. According to the claimants on the date of accident the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad was 20 years old. However, the inquest Lilabai & ors. Vs. Gurvindarsingh & Otrs. Judgment – MACP No.617/2015 (( 9 )) panchanama Exh.­47 and postmortem report Exh.­49 goes to prove that on the date of accident the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad was 18 years old. In the circumstances, as per ruling of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sarla Varma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another, 2009(2) T.A.C. 677 (S.C.) the multiplier 18 can be applied to this case. 18.Now so as to determine income of the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad the FIR Exh.­45 shows that he was working as cleaner on the offending vehicle. It is the contention of claimants that the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad was earning Rs.15,000/­ per month. But in fact there is no proof to hold that the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad was earning Rs.15,000/­ per month as cleaner on the offending vehicle. In such circumstances I have no alternative than to consider the notional income of Rs.4,500/­ per month as per the ruling of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ramchandrappa Vs. Manager, Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Company Ltd., reported in 2011(4) T.A.C. (1) (S.C.) . In the circumstances the calculation would be as follows :­ Rs.4,500 X 12 X 18 = Rs.9,72,000/­ 19.The deceased Sandeep Gaikwad was bachelor at the time of accident. As such, 50% deductions should be considered towards the personal and living expenses of the deceased as per the observations of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sarla Varma and others Vs. Delhi 10 Transport Corporation and another, 2009(2) T.A.C. 677 (S.C.). Therefore, claimant are entitled for 50% of Rs.9,72,000/­ which comes to Rs.4,86,000/­ towards loss of dependency. 20.The deceased Sandeep Gaikwad died bachelor, therefore, as per the observations of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of National Insurance Company Limited Vs. Pranay Sethi and Ors., Special Leave Petition (Civil) 25590/2014 dated 31.10.2017 . the claimants are entitled for Rs.15,000/­ towards funeral expenses and Rs.15,000/­ towards loss of estate. As such, claimants are entitled for compensation as follows. Rs. 4,86,000/­ Towards loss of dependency Rs. 15,000/­ Towards funeral expenses. Rs. 15,000/­ Towards loss of estate. ========================================== Rs. 5,16,000/­ Total compensation ========================================== 21.As such claimants are entitled for total compensation of Rs.5,16,000/­ and respondent No.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the same with 9% interest from the date of filing of this petition i.e. 21.09.2015 till its full realization as per the observations of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Smt. Neeta w/o Kallappa Kadolkar and others Vs. The Divisional Manager, MSRTC, Kolhapur reported in 2015(1) T.A.C.340 (S.C.). 22.The claimants are failed to prove fixed and permanent Lilabai & ors. Vs. Gurvindarsingh & Otrs. Judgment – MACP No.617/2015 (( 11 )) income of the deceased Sandeep Gaikwad. Therefore, question does not arise to add the additional income towards future prospects. Furthermore, it is hereby clear that the sister of deceased Sandeep Gaikwad i.e. claimant No.3 Anita Surase cannot be considered as dependent on the deceased because she is major and married woman. Therefore, it is hereby held that claimant No.1 and 2 only are entitled for the total compensation of Rs.5,16,000/­. Accordingly issue No.2 and 3 proved, hence I answer the same in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO.4 :­ 23.In view of findings given to aforesaid issues, the claim of the claimant deserves to be allowed partly with proportionate costs as against the respondents. In the circumstances, respondent No.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay total compensation of Rs.5,16,000/­ to the claimant No.1 and 2 with 9% interest from the date of filing petition i.e 21.09.2015 till its full realization. It is hereby made it clear that claimant No.3 is the married sister of deceased. She cannot be considered as dependents of deceased being major and married sister. Therefore, no part of compensation amount is awarded to her. In the circumstances I proceed to pass the following order. ORDER 1]The claim of the claimants is hereby allowed partly with proportionate costs as follows :­ 12 2]Respondent Nos.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation amount of Rs.5,16,000/­ (Rupees Five Lacs Sixteen Thousand Only) with 9% interest to the claimant No.1 and 2 only from the date of filing of this petition i.e. 21.09.2015 till its realization, including NFL amount of Rs.50,000/­. 3]Aforesaid compensation amount be apportioned amongst the claimants as follows :­ Claimant No.1 ­Rs.4,16,000/­ Claimant No.2 ­ Rs.1,00,000/­ by account payee cheques. 4]The compensation amount of minor claimant No.2 of Rs.1,00,000/­ (Rs. One Lack Only) be invested in fixed deposit scheme of any nationalized bank as per choise of claimant No.1 till he attains the majority and its interest be credited to the account of claimant no.1 with quarterly rest. 5]It is hereby made it clear that claimant No.3 being major and married sister of deceased Sandeep Gaikwad is not entitled for compensation amount in this case. 6]Award be prepared accordingly. 7]Order pronounced in open Court.

CLAIM:­ Petition under Section 166 of The Motor Vehicles Act 1988 for grant of compensation Rs. 25,00,000/­ . ....................................................................................................... Mr Sk. Vazir Patel, Advocate for Claimants. Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 – Ex­parte Mr A.S. Pol, Advocate for Respondent No. 3 ....................................................................................................... J U D G M E N T (Delivered in open court on : 15/07/2017 ) This petition is filed by the claimants for grant of compensation of Rs. 25,00,000/­ under Section 166 of The Motor Vehicles Act 1988. 2)Claimants case in nutshell is as under :­ Claimants have alleged that, an accident took place 3 [MACP No.193/2015] on 09/02/2015 at about 6.40 P .M. at Manpur to Dhamnod road, District Indore (M.P .). At the time of accident, deceased Syed Khudrat Ali was driving a Container bearing No. HR­46­B­5512 from Delhi to Telangana. The Cleaner Satish was with him. The driver has parked his container near Gopal Dhaba for natures call. When he was walking by the side of road, at that time, one Bus bearing No. MH­07­G­6479 came in high speed with negligent manner and dashed him. He sustained serious injuries and shifted to Manpur Hospital and thereafter, at Indore for further medical treatment. He was admitted from 09/02/2015 to 17/02/2015 and during the treatment, he expired on 17/02/2015. 3)They have further contended that, doctor has carried his postmortem. The claimants have spent expenditure of Rs. 1 lacs on medical. The Cleaner Satish Lodge lodged FIR in Manpur Police Station. Upon due inquiry, crime was registered under section 279, 337, 304­A of IPC against bus driver (No. MH­07­G­ 6479). 4)They have further contended that, at the time of accident, deceased was just 38 years. The claimant no. 1 is his wife and nos. 2 to 4 are his children. The claimant no. 5 is old aged mother. All claimants are depend upon him. He was only earning in his family. The deceased was driver and getting salary of Rs. 10,000/­ P .M. Due to his untimely death, the claimants 4 suffered mental agony and financial loss. The respondent No. 1 was driver on bus, while respondent no. 2 was registered owner and respondent no. 3 is the Insurance Company. Therefore, all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation. They have lastly prayed, claim may be allowed. 5)Respondent nos. 1 and 2 have been duly served summons vide Exh. 21 but they failed to appear, thus ex­parte order passed against them. 6)Respondent no. 3 has filed say and W .S. vide Exh. 15 and denied entire allegations. He has specifically alleged that, deceased was crossing the road hurriedly and due to his negligence, an accident took place. There was no negligence of respondent No. 1. However, he has admitted that, the vehicle was insured with respondent No. 3. The claim is excessive and exorbitant. The deceased did not have effective driving license at the time of accident. The claimants have not adduced documentary evidence to support their contention. There is no documents to show that, deceased was driver with respondent no. 2 and was getting Rs. 10,000/­ P .M. 7)He has further contended that, as no negligence occurred on the part of respondent no. 1, therefore, question of claiming compensation does not arise. In the result, claim may be rejected. 5 [MACP No.193/2015] 8)Considering rival contentions of the parties, issues have been framed vide Exh. 25 and I record my findings against each for the reasons given below:­ ISSUES FINDINGS 1Whether the petitioners prove that the deceased died in the motor vehicular accident due to rash and negligent driving of Bus bearing No. MH­07­G­ 6479 ?: In the Affirmative. 2Whether the petitioners prove that, the deceased died due to injuries caused in the accident ?: In the Affirmative. 3Whether petitioner proves that respondent no. 1 was driver of Bus No. MP­07­G­6479, respondent no. 2 is owner and No. 3 is the Insurance Company ?In the affirmative. 4Whether claimants are entitled compensation with interest, if yes, at what rate ?As per final order. 5Who are responsible to pay the compensation ?Respondent Nos. 1 to 3. 6What order ? : As per final order. REASONS 9) The claimants are relied upon the following documents:­ F .I.R. is at Exh. 29, Crime details form (spot­ panchanama) is at Exh. 30, accidental death report is at Exh. 31, postmortem report is at Exh.32, Form COMP “AA” is at Exh. 33, 6 property seizure memo is at Exh. 34, Certificate of registration of offending vehicle is at Exh. 35, Insurance policy is at Exh. 36, driving license of respondent no. 1 is at Exh. 37. Original driving license of the deceased is at Exh. 38. Forty medical bills are at Exh. 39 collectively, CT Scan bill is at Exh. 40, thirteen receipts of Mohak Specialty Hospital is at Exh. 41 collectively. AS TO ISSUE NOS.1 to 3 : 10)Issue nos. 1 to 3 are interlinked, therefore, I decide it intermingle to avoid repetitions and for court's convenience. 11)To prove the contentions, the claimant has examined three witnesses. He has been examined vide Exh. 26. PW 2 vide Exh. 43 and cleaner of the container vide Exh. 44. The claim against respondent nos. 1 and 2 proceeded ex­parte. Respondent No. 3 has not examined himself or other witness to support his contention. 12)It is the main contention of the claimant that, claimant No. 1 is wife and 2 to 4 are children and no. 5 is mother of the deceased Kudrat Ali. He was driver on the container of respondent no. 2 and getting salary of Rs. 10,000/­ P .M. On the day of accident, deceased was driving container bearing No. HR 47­B­5512 from Delhi to Telangana alongwith cleaner (Satish). He parked container near Gopal Dhaba for natures call. When deceased was walking by the side of road, at the same time, one 7 [MACP No.193/2015] Bus No. MH­07­G­6479 came in high speed with rash and negligent manner and dashed to him. In the accident, he sustained serious injuries. Immediately, he was shifted to Manpur hospital and thereafter in Medical College at Indore for further treatment. During treatment he was expired on 17/2/2015. Thereafter postmortem was carried. It is pertinent to note that at the time of accident deceased was walking by the side of road to attend natures call and not driving the vehicle. 13)The learned Advocate for claimant has attracted my attention towards the spot panchanama. It is at Exh. 30. It clearly reveals that deceased was walking by the side of road. He was at extreme left side. Bus in question suddenly came and dashed him. I think, due to excessive speed he could not controlled and therefore he had given dash to the deceased. Moreover respondent no. 1 is important witnesses to the scene of an accident but he did not appear purposefully to avoid responsibility. Non appearance in the court strengthens claimants theory. After accident, deceased was admitted in Manpur hospital and thereafter, in medical College at Indore where he expired during treatment. Postmortem report filed on record to support his contention (Exh. 31). 14)Not only this, the claimant also examined eye witness, who was cleaner on the said container alongwith 8 deceased. He has deposed vide Exh. 44 that, when they parked their container near Gopal Dhaba in order to go natures call, at that time a Bus in question has come in high speed and gave dash to Kudrat Ali. An accident occurred due to fault of bus driver. I am of view, that, evidence filed on record is sufficient to hold that an accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 1. Respondent no. 3 has admitted that the bus in question was driven by respondent no. 1 which was owned by respondent no. 2 and it was duly insured with respondent no. 3. 15)Learned Advocate for respondent no. 3 has vehemently argued that, “Claimant has admitted in cross­ examination that I do not know how the accident took place. I had not seen the accident personally”. Therefore, her evidence cannot be considered. To support his contention, he has attracted my attention towards the citation of National Insurance Company Ltd. Vs. Asha Shyam and Others reported in 2015 (2) T.A.C. 373 (Gau.) and Mrs. Meera Siddharth Kambli and Others Vs. Mr. Viraj Ekawade and Others reported in 2015 (3) T.A.C. 152 (Bom.). I am of view that, the ratio laid down in the above citation would not be applicable in the case in hand, in the present scenario, because, mere she has not seen the accident personally and do not know, how the accident took place, it does not mean 9 [MACP No.193/2015] that, her entire evidence can be discarded. I am of view that, negligence of offending vehicle's driver can be gathered on the basis of police papers and relevant documents. Applicant examined PW 3 Shri Satish Bagul, who was Cleaner on the said Truck. He is an eye witness. He has specifically deposed that, when deceased parked his container to go to nature's call, at that time, offending vehicle came in high speed and dashed to him. 16)Learned Advocate for respondent no. 3 has further argued that, claimant has admitted that she doesn't know, what her husband was doing. It means, her husband was not the driver. I am of view that, claimant has filed driving license of deceased vide Exh. 38. It is a license of transport vehicle. Claimant has examined PW 2 Krushna Nawale vide Exh. 43, stating that, he is manager of Shivshakti Cargo India Logistic of respondent no.2. Deceased Kudrat was driver on the said container. Owner of the container gives salary of Rs.10,000/­ P .M. He has filed salary­ certificate Exh. 51, it bears signature of Manager and stamp of of Shivshakti Cargo. Therefore, mere claimant has given one admission, does not mean that, the other relevant evidence is to be discarded. 17)Learned Advocate of respondent No. 3 has vehemently argued that, the driving license of respondent no. 1 10 was expired prior to accident. He argued that, accident occurred on 09/02/2015 and his license expired on 07/02/2015 (Exh. 37). Therefore, he had no license on the date of accident, thus, responsibility of insurance company cannot be fastened. 18)Learned Advocate of claimant has argued that, though his license is expired on 7/2/2015 and accident occurred on 9/2/2015, even though, under section 14 (2) (b) (ii) of the Motor Vehicles Act, the said license shall be effective for a period of 30 days from such expiry. Not only this, to support his contention he attracted my attention towards the citation Neena Shukla and another Vs Amar Singh and others reported in 2017 (2) T.A.C. 223 (H.P .) . I am of view that, the section is very clear that, the license shall be effective for a period of 30 days from the date of expiry. Therefore, defence taken by respondent no. 3 is not tenable. Considering the entire circumstances, I am of view that, deceased died in the accident of bus No. MP­07­G­6479 due to rash and negligent driving and respondent no. 1 was driver, no. 2 was its owner and no. 3 was Insurance Company. Thus, I answer issue No. 1 to 3 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NOS. 4 & 5 : 19)According to claimant, deceased Kudrat Ali was driver on the container bearing No. MP­07­G­6479 and was getting of Rs. 11 [MACP No.193/2015] 10,000/­ P .M. No doubt, the claimant has examined witness of Shivshakti Cargo, wherein he deposed that, he had salary of Rs.10,000/­ P .M. Already I have discussed supra that, the deceased was driver on the container. The question remains only, whether he had salary of Rs. 10,000/­ or not. Though the claimant and his witness deposed that, he had salary of Rs.10,000/­, but I am of view that, generally the employer gives salary certificate little bit on higher side due to sympathy of the deceased. Generally any person can earn Rs. 250/­ to 300/­ per day easily. Considering the said income, I am of view that, instead of holding salary of Rs. 10,000/­, it would be appropriate to assess of Rs. 8,000/­ P .M. 20)AGE :­ The birth date of deceased is 01/03/1977 as per driving licenses. The date of accident is 09/02/2015. Therefore, his age would be 38 years on the relevant date. Therefore, Multipler “15” would be applicable in view of Smith Sarla Verma and ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Ors. Reported in 2009 (2) T.A.C. 677 (Supreme Court ). 21)There are five dependents, thus, there would be 1/4th deduction towards personal and living expenses in view of Sarla Varmas case (Cited Supra). Considering the circumstances, I calculate the compensation as follows : 12 Sr. No. Heads Calculations Rupees 1 Yearly income of deceased : Rs.8,000 p.m. X 12 = 96,000 2 1/4rd deduction as a personal and living expenses : Rs. 96,000 – 24,000 =72,000 3 Compensation after applying multiplier of “15” : Rs. 72,000 x 15 = 10,80,000 4 Medical expenses 68,275 5 Loss of consortium 1,00,000 6 Loss of love and affection. 1,00,000 7 Funeral­expenses 25,000 Total = 13,73,275/­ 22) Thus, the claimants are entitled compensation of Rs. 13,73,275/­ (Rs. Thirteen Lacs, Seventy Three Thousand and Two Hundred and Seventy Five Only). 23) The claimants have requested to grant interest @ Rs.18% per annum. I am of the view that, the said interest would be exorbitant. Instead of that, as per Kanhsingh Vs Tukaram 2015 (2) T.A.C. 689 (Supreme Court) the interest @ Rs.9% per annum would be proper and reasonable. 24) In view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Khenyei versus New India Assurance 13 [MACP No.193/2015] Company Limited and others. The claimant can recover the aforesaid compensation from the respondents jointly and severally. Thus, I answer issue Nos. 4 & 5 in the affirmative and proceed to pass the following order:­ ORDER 1) The claim­petition is allowed with proportionate costs. 2) The respondent Nos. 1 to 3 are hereby directed to pay a compensation of Rs. 13,73,275/­ (Rs. Thirteen Lacs Seventy Three Thousand, Two Hundred and Seventy Five Only) to the claimants jointly and severally with interest at the rate of 9 % per annum from the date of petition, i.e. 10/03/2015, till realization of the entire payment, after deducting the NFL amount, if paid. 3)Out of an awarded compensation, an amount of Rs. 1,00,000/­ (Rs. One Lacs Only) be given to the claimant No. 1 Mehrunissa and claimant no. 5 Bismillah Bee each. 4)The remaining compensation be invested in fix deposit in any nationalized Bank in the name of claimant no. 1 for the welfare of minor claimant nos. 2 to 4 for five years. 5)An award be drawn accordingly.

S.K. Hiwale, Advocate for the claimant. Shri D.A. Khedkar, Advocate for Resp. 1 & 2 Shri K.N. Pawar, Advocate for Resp. No.3. _______________________________________________ J U D G M E N T ( Delivered on 08/11/2019) 1.This is an application under Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, for compensation due to injuries sustained in motor vehicular accident. 2.The brief facts, stated by applicant are as below :­ It is the contention of the claimant that on 15/07/2015, at 12­45 hours, he was traveling on Motorcycle No. MH­20­CZ­ ­ 3 ­ M.A.C.P. No.549.2015 (Judgment) 0242, as a rider from Aurangabad to Sillod via Fulambri. When he passed village Fulambri and proceeding towards Sillod side, at that time, near petrol pump, opposite Girija Hotel, the driver of one TATA Indigo Car No. MH­19­Ax­6097 had given sudden dash to the claimant and his motorcycle from backside. Respondent no.1 – driver of said offending car was driving it in a rash and negligent manner without following traffic rules. In the said accident, the claimant had sustained serious fracture on his cervical vertebra of neck, fracture to his both side last two ribs. The accident occurred only due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 only. 3.The crime No. I­130/2015, was registered against respondent no.1 – driver of offending car, U/ss. 279,337, 338 of IPC. Initially the claimant was admitted in Rural Government Hospital Phulambri, but after some first aid treatment, on the same day he was shifted to AIMS Hospital at Aurangabad. He had taken treatment there as an indoor patient since 15.07.2015 to 27.07.2015, and after discharge from said hospital, he had taken treatment as outdoor patient. The claimant had spent more than Rs.90,000/­ for his treatment. In future also the claimant require treatment and for that he require more than Rs.10,000/­ for medicine expenses. He also spent Rs.20,000/­ to attend hospital time to time. It is then contention of the claimant that he was working as a Worker in Chandra Mata Company and earning Rs.14000/­ per month. He had sustained more than 50% total ­ 4 ­ M.A.C.P. No.549.2015 (Judgment) permanent disability. He had lost his working capacity completely. Therefore, the claimant claimed compensation of Rs.2,00,000/­ from the respondents jointly and severally. 4.Respondents No.1 & 2 filed their written statement at Exh.17 and denied the claim of claimant. It is contended by these respondents that the claimant has not produced any service record along with age proof. The claimant has not produced registration certificate of TATA Indigo C.S. Car No. MH­19­Ax­6097. It is contended that the claim of claimant is incorrect, exorbitant and liable to be dismissed. It is contended by these respondents that respondent no.1 was having valid and effective driving license and respondent No.2 has valid insurance to respondent No.3. They prayed for dismissal of the claim petition. 5.Respondent No.3 – Insurance company has filed its written statement vide Exh.16 and denied the contents and allegations made in the claim petition. The involvement of the alleged vehicle TATA Indigo CS Car No. MH­19­AX­6097 is specifically denied. It is specifically denied that the vehicle was validly insured with this respondent company. It is contended that the compensation claimed by the claimant is exorbitant, excessive, incorrect and deserves to be dismissed against this respondent No.3. It is specifically denied about injuries caused to the claimant. It is contended that the Motorcycle No. MH­20­CZ­0242 involved ­ 5 ­ M.A.C.P. No.549.2015 (Judgment) in the alleged accident, but the owner, driver, and insurance company are not made parties in the present claim petition, hence the claim petition of claimant is suffered from non­joinder of necessary parties and on this count also claim petition deserves to be dismissed. Lastly they prayed for dismissal of claim petition. 6.In view of rival pleadings of the parties my learned predecessor framed issues at Exh.23. I have recorded my findings thereon for the reasons given below. POINTS FINDINGS 1Whether the accident took place on 15.07.2015 at about 12­45 hours on Aurangabad to Sillod road near Petrol Pump at village Phulambri due to rash and negligent driving of TATA Indigo CS Car bearing registration No. MH­19­AX­6097 by its driver ?Yes 2Whether the claimant sustained permanent disability due to the injuries suffered by him in the said accident ?If yes, to what extent ?.. Yes, as per discussions. 3Whether the claimant is entitled to get compensation ? If yes, from whom and to what extent ?Yes, as per final order 4.What order ? As per final order ­ 6 ­ M.A.C.P. No.549.2015 (Judgment) REASONS 7.In support of claimant, claimant examined himself below Exh.24 as CW1. He also examined Ajay Madanlal Patni (CW2) at Exh.32, who is Accountant at Aims Hospital Aurangabad and Dr. Sachin Surendra Bedmutha (CW3) at Exh.35. In addition to oral evidence, claimant relied on FIR Exh.26, Spot Panchnama Exh.27, Form Comp.AA Exh.8, Medical Bills Exh.33, 33­A t 33­I, Form Comp.B at Exh.36, and copy of Discharge Card, copy of driving license of Respondent No.1, Copy of registration certificate of Car and copy of insurance policy of Car No. MH­190AX­6097 (Exh.38). Claimant has filed evidence closed purshis at Exh.37. Respondent No.3 – Insurance Company did not adduce any evidence and filed Purshis Exh.39. AS TO ISSUES NO. 1 :­ 8.In brief, the claimant deposed that on 15/07/2015, he was proceeding on his Motorcycle bearing No. MH­20­CZ­0242, towards Sillod. When he reached near Girja Petrol Pump, at that time the Car having registration No. MH­19­AX­6097, gave dash to his Motorcycle on back side. Due to dash he sustained injuries. He also deposed that after accident, crime has been registered against respondent No.1, who was driver of the Car at the relevant time U/ss. 279, 337, 338 of the Indian Penal Code. ­ 7 ­ M.A.C.P. No.549.2015 (Judgment) The police papers which are admissible in evidence as per the decision in United India Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Sayaji Mhasuji Shinde : 2009 (3) Mh.L.J. 539 . It was further held that : “The certified copies of police papers like inquest, FIR, spot panchanama go in evidence without any additional proof .” In Bimla Devi and Ors. V. Himachal Road Transport Corporation and Ors. : (2009) 13 SC 530 , it was held that in a petition u/s 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 the Claim Tribunal has to decide the negligence on the touchstone of preponderance of probability and holistic view is to be taken while dealing with the Claim Petition. In New India Assurance Co. Ltd. V. Sakshi Bhutani & ors, MAC APP. 550/2011 decided on 02.07.2012 by Hon’ble Mr. Justice G.P. Mittal (Delhi High Court), it was observed that it has to be borne in mind that the Motor Vehicles Act does not envisage holding a trial for a petition preferred under Section 166 of the Act. Under Section 168 of the Act, a Claims Tribunal is enjoined to hold an inquiry to determine compensation which must appear to it to be just. Strict rules of evidence are not applicable in an inquiry conducted by the Claims Tribunal. Further in State of Mysore Vs. S.S. Makapur : 1993 (2) SCR 943 , the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that the Tribunals exercising quasi­ judicial functions are not courts and are not bound by strict rules of evidence. The relevant portion of the report is extracted hereunder : “…….that tribunals exercising quasi­ judicial functions are not courts and that therefore they are not ­ 8 ­ M.A.C.P. No.549.2015 (Judgment) bound to follow the procedure prescribed for trial of actions in courts nor are they bound by strict rules of evidence. They can unlike courts, obtain all information for the points under the inquiry from all sources, and through all channels, without being fettered by rules and procedure, which govern proceedings in court. The only obligation which the law casts on them is that they should not act on any information which they may receive unless they put it to the party against whom it is to be used and give him a fair opportunity to explain it. What is a fair opportunity depend on the facts and circumstances of each case but where such an opportunity has been given, the proceedings are not open to attack on the ground that the enquiry was not conducted in accordance with the procedure followed in courts.” 9.Reference may also be made to the following observations in Ranu Bala Paul & Others vs. Bani Chakraborty : 1999 ACJ 634 Gauhati wherein the claim was allowed after consideration of FIR before the Tribunal : “In deciding a matter Tribunal should bear in mind the caution struck by the Apex Court that a claim before the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal is neither a criminal case nor a civil case. In a criminal case in order to have conviction, the matter is to be proved beyond reasonable doubt and in a civil case the matter is to be decided on the basis of preponderance of evidence, but in a claim before the Motor Accident Claim Tribunal the standard of proof is much below than what is required in a criminal case as well as in a civil case. No doubt before the Tribunal, there must be some material on the basis of which the Tribunal can arrive or decide things necessary to be decided for awarding compensation. But the Tribunal is not expected to take or to adopt the nicety of a civil or of a criminal case. ­ 9 ­ M.A.C.P. No.549.2015 (Judgment) After all, it is a summary enquiry and this is a legislation for the welfare of the society. In N.K.V. Bros. (P) Ltd. v. M. Marumai Ammal, 1980 ACJ 435 (SC), the Supreme Court pointed out that the Accidents Claims Tribunal must take special care to see that innocent victims do not suffer and persons liable do not escape liability merely because of some doubt here and some obscurity there. The court should not succumb to niceties, technicalities and mystic maybes. The court is bound to take broad view of the whole matter.” 10.Looking from any manner and in any event the default and wrongful manner of driving are of the driver of the offending car i.e. opponent No.1 is manifest. I, therefore, hold that the applicant has proved default and wrongful manner of driving of the Respondent no. 1 in driving the offending car and a logical corollary the insurer has failed to establish the wrongful and rash and negligent driving of the applicant in driving the motor bike. In that view of the matter, I answer the point No.1 in the affirmative . AS TO ISSUES NO.2 TO 4 :­ 11.Coming to the quantum of compensation, claimant has claimed compensation under the heads of Pecuniary Damages and Non pecuniary damages as well as special Damages. Hence I have discussed as per the claim of claimant under different heads. Compensation on account of loss of future earning capacity as per disability :­ 12The claimant deposed that on the day of accident his age ­ 10 ­ M.A.C.P. No.549.2015 (Judgment) was 35 years, in the accident he sustained permanent disability due to which he lost future earning capacity. On the ground of loss of future income capacity, he claimed compensation. He also deposed that, in accident he sustained fracture injuries to his body on chest and fracture to his bone. Therefore, he was treated at Government Hospital Phulambri and thereafter in AIMS Hospital Aurangabad. He was indoor patient from 15/07/2015 to 27/07/2015 in AIMS Hospital. For the purpose of treatment he incurred expenses. In support of his contention that he sustained permanent disability, he examined Dr. Sachin Bedmutha (CW3) at Exh.35. He deposed that on his examination, he came to the conclusion that the claimant sustained 8% permanent disability and accordingly he issued Disability Certificate which is placed on record at Exh.36. In cross examination, he admitted that he never given treatment to the claimant. He also deposed that the claimant do job properly. He denied that the injuries sustained to the claimants are completely cured as well as denied the fact that the claimant has not suffered any permanent disability stated by him. 13.The principles summarized by the Apex Court in respect of computation of the percentage of the disabilities in case of Raj Kumar Vs. Ajay Kumar reported in (2011) 1 SCC 343 are excerpted below : “19. We may now summarise the principles discussed above : ­ 11 ­ M.A.C.P. No.549.2015 (Judgment) (i) All injuries (or permanent disabilities arising from injuries), do not result in loss of earning capacity. (ii) The percentage of permanent disability with reference to the whole body of a person, cannot be assumed to be the percentage of loss of earning capacity. To put it differently, the percentage of loss of earning capacity is not the same as the percentage of permanent disability (except in a few cases, where the Tribunal on the basis of evidence, concludes that percentage of loss of earning capacity is the same as percentage of permanent disability). (iii) The doctor who treated an injured­claimant or who examined him subsequently to assess the extent of his permanent disability can give evidence only in regard the extent of permanent disability. The loss of earning capacity is something that will have to be assessed by the Tribunal with reference to the evidence in entirety. (iv) The same permanent disability may result in different percentages of loss of earning capacity in different persons, depending upon the nature of profession, occupation or job, age, education and other factors.” 14.Ascertainment of the effect of the permanent disability on the actual earning capacity involves three steps. The Tribunal has to first ascertain what activities the claimant could carry on in spite of the permanent disability and what he could not do as a result of the permanent ability (this is also relevant for awarding compensation under the head of loss of amenities of life). The second step is to ascertain his avocation, profession and nature of work before the accident, as also his age. The third step is to find ­ 12 ­ M.A.C.P. No.549.2015 (Judgment) out whether (i) the claimant is totally disabled from earning any kind of livelihood, or (ii) whether in spite of the permanent disability, the claimant could still effectively carry on the activities and functions, which he was earlier carrying on, or (iii) whether he was prevented or restricted from discharging his previous activities and functions, but could carry on some other or lesser scale of activities and functions so that he continues to earn or can continue to earn his livelihood. 15.In this case claimant deposed that, at present he is not doing any work. He further stated that, prior to accident he use to work at Chandra Matts and use to earn amount of Rs. 14000/­ per month. He has not deposed what work he use to do prior to accident and what is effect of disability on his work. Dr. Sachin Surendra Bedmutha CW3 admitted in cross examination that, claimant has not suffered any fracture, he further admitted that, claimant can do job properly. 16.In view of guidelines of Hon’ble Supreme Court mentioned earlier though claimant claimed that, he is not doing any work and in view of evidence of Dr. Sachin C.W.3 it is not clear that what is functional disability caused to the claimant. As the Dr. Sachin admitted that, claimant can do his job properly it means that, there is no functional disability caused to the claimant. In spite of disability mentioned by Dr. Sachin he can do his job ­ 13 ­ M.A.C.P. No.549.2015 (Judgment) properly. Therefore I am of the opinion that, though claimant sustained permanent disability as per the evidence of Dr. Sachin CW.3 it is not functional disability, therefore it cannot be taken in to consideration as loss of future earning capacity . 17.Therefore I am of the opinion that, claimant has not proved that he suffered functional disability therefore in my opinion he is not entitle for compensation on account of loss of future income capacity. Medical expenses ,Conveyance and special Diet :­ 18.In support of contention that he incurred expenses for medical treatment, the claimant examined Accountant of AIMS Hospital Aurangabad namely Ajay Madanlal Patni (CW2) at Exh.32. He deposed that the claimant was admitted in AIMS Hospital and paid bills as per Exh.33, 33A to 33­I. As per Exh. 33 bill amount is of Rs. 22950/­, As per Exh. 33(A to I ) bill amount is shown as Rs. 7850. Hence on the basis of receipts on record and oral evidence of Ajay Madanlal Patni CW2, claimant proved that, he incurred expenses for treatment of Rs. , 30800/­. There is no evidence about requirement of future treatment hence claimant is entitle for Rs. 30800/­ on account of medical expenses incurred by him. In addition to medical expenses he is also entitle for compensation on account of Attendance and ­ 14 ­ M.A.C.P. No.549.2015 (Judgment) conveyance charges of Rs. 5000/­ and on the head of Special diet of Rs. 5000/­ . Entitlement of compensation is given in tabular form as under :­ Heads of compensation Amounts (Rupees) Loss of future Income Not entitle. Medical ExpensesRs.30800/­ Attendance and conveyance chargesRs.5000 Non­Pecuniary Damages Special Diet: Rs.5000/­ Damages for mental and physical shock, pain and suffering already sufferedRs. 25000/­ Total CompensationRs. 65800/­ 19. Claimant is also entitled for interest on above amount @ 7% pa, from the date of filing of the petition till the date of realization ­ 15 ­ M.A.C.P. No.549.2015 (Judgment) or deposit of the entire amount. Hence I answer issues no. 2 & 3 accordingly. 20.Claimant claimed compensation jointly and severally from respondents. It is admitted fact that respondent no.2 is owner of the vehicle involved in accident. On the basis of police papers i.e. FIR Exh.26, respondent no.1 is prosecuted as driver of offending vehicle. On the basis of insurance certificate Exh.38, it reveals that offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.3. Therefore, I am of the opinion that all the respondents are jointly or severally liable to pay amount of compensation to the claimant. Hence to answer Point No.4, I pass following order :­ O R D E R 1]The petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs. 2]Opponents jointly and severally shall pay the compensation of Rs. 65800/­ (Rs. Sixty Five Thousand Eight Hundred only) to the Claimant along with interest thereon @ 7 % per annum from the date of filing of the petition till realization of entire amount. ­ 16 ­ M.A.C.P. No.549.2015 (Judgment) 3]The amount if any paid on account of “No Fault Liability”, then the said amount may be deducted from the amount of compensation. 4]After depositing the amount of compensation as above be paid to the Claimant by account payee cheque. 5]Award shall be drawn accordingly, subject to payment of deficit court fee, if any.

No.800.2015 (Judgment) 1.This is an application under Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, for compensation due to injuries sustained in motor vehicular accident. 2.The brief facts, stated by applicant are as below :­ It is the contention of the claimant that on 04/11/2015, the claimant was travelling with her grand father and grand mother by S.T. Bus bearing No. MH­20­BL­1100, from Beed to Aurangabad. When said S.T. Bus reached ahead village Mahakala Phata, at 2­30 hours, one truck bearing No. MH­23­4787 came from opposite side and as the drivers of both vehicles i.e. Truck and S.T. Bus were driving their respective vehicles in a very high and excessive speed and in a very rash and negligent manner colluded due to which the accident took place. Due to said accident the claimant, her grand father and grand mother and other persons travalling in the said bus were injured. 3.It is further contended by the claimant that the crime No. I­190/2015, was registered against respondent no.1 – driver of offending Truck, U/ss. 279,337, 338, 427 of IPC. In the said accident, the claimant sustained bleeding injuries on her neck, chick, lips and other multiple injuries on her other parts of body. The claimant was shifted in Kamalnayan Bajaj Hospital, Aurangabad and she was admitted there from 04/11/2015 to 05/11/2015, as an indoor patient. During the course of medical ­ 4 ­ M.A.C.P. No.800.2015 (Judgment) treatment the concern doctors had given stitches on her neck, chick, lips and also treated on her other injuries. The claimant had incurred medical expenses of Rs.15000/­ for medicines, and hospitalization. Since the date of accident the claimant is taking regular medical treatment. Doctor advised the claimant that she is in need of future medical treatment i.e. the claimant requires to perform the plastic surgery because her face got disfigured. For that purpose the claimant requires Rs.30,000/­ to Rs.50,000/­. Prior to accident the claimant was leading her life happily and taking education in Jr. K.G. Standard . She is very brilliant in her study. The injured is only daughter to her parents. The face of injured claimant came to be disfigured and hence the entire future dreams of injured claimant and her parents are gone in vain. Therefore, the claimant claimed compensation of Rs.2,00,000/­ from the respondents jointly and severally. 4.Respondents No.1 & 2 filed their written statement at Exh.31 and denied the claim of claimant. It is contended by these respondents that Gondi Police Station Dist. Jalna has not rightly investigated the crime and registered the offence against respondent no.1 i.e. driver of Truck No. MH­23­4787. There was no negligence on the part of said truck driver. The driver of said truck was tried to save S.T. Bus bearing No. MH­20­BL­1100 but in­ vain and accident happened. These respondents also denied the manner in which accident was happened and specifically denied ­ 5 ­ M.A.C.P. No.800.2015 (Judgment) about injuries caused to claimant as well as denied medical expenses. It is contended by these respondents that their vehicle was insured with respondent No.3 – United India General Insurance company which is effective for the period from 18/11/2014 to 17/11/2015. They contended that if the liability comes towards said respondents, then respondent No.3 insurer of the said truck is liable for the said liability. They contended that the claim of rupees two lakhs is highly excessive and exorbitant. Lastly they prayed for dismissal of the claim petition. 5.The respondent No.3 – United India Insurance Company filed its written statement at Exh.21 and specifically denied about injuries, treatment obtained by claimant from Kamalnayan Bajaj Hospital and about medical expenses to the tune of Rs.15000/­ incurred by the claimant. They denied about rash and negligent driving of Truck No.MH­23­4787. They contended that the accident in question had taken place due to sole negligent act on the part of respondent No.4 i.e. driver of S.T. Bus. It is contended that the crime was registered on the report lodged by respondent No.4 i.e. S.T. Driver. It is contended that at the time of accident, the respondent No.1 was driving the vehicle without holding any valid and effective driving license. It is contended that the said truck was being plied on the road without any valid permit and fitness on the date of accident, hence it is fundamental breach of policy. It is contended that the claimant did not sustain any sort of ­ 6 ­ M.A.C.P. No.800.2015 (Judgment) injury which can be converted into permanent disability. It is contended that the claim is excessive, exorbitant and baseless, hence same is liable to be dismissed. Respondent no.3 lastly prayed for dismissal of the claim petition. 6.Respondent No.4 – filed his written statement at Exh.32 and denied the contents of Para No.1 to 22 being incorrect. It is specifically denied that on the day of accident, the claimant, her grand mother and grand father were traveling in S.T. Bus No. MH­ 20­BL­1100. It is denied that he was driving his S.T. Bus in a very rash and negligent manner and gave dash to Truck No. MH­23­ 4787. It is denied that the claimant, grand mother and grand father sustained injuries on their person. Respondent no.4 has no concern whatsoever with the alleged accident, however, the claimant has deliberately and intentionally made party to the present respondent No.4. The crime is registered against respondent no.1 – truck driver on his complaint and it is required to be taken into consideration. No cross complaint is filed against him by the truck driver. In short, he denied that the claimant was admitted in hospital and incurred Rs.15000/­ for treatment. It is contended by this respondent that the claim of claimant is exorbitant and excessive and prayed for dismissal of the claim. 7.The respondent no.5 – MSRTC filed its written statement vide Exh.28 and denied the claim of the claimant. It is contended ­ 7 ­ M.A.C.P. No.800.2015 (Judgment) that the crime has been registered against truck driver only i.e. respondent No.1. It is contended that all the drivers and Conductors of ST Bus are well trained and after giving necessary training, they allowed to work on public road. The police authority has rightly lodged the crime against the driver of truck bearing No. MH­23­4787 i.e. respondent No.1 and in the entire police papers there is nothing against ST Bus about negligence. It is lastly contended that the accident is occurred only on the fault of driver of truck bearing No. MH­23­4787, therefore claim petition is liable to be dismissed against respondents No.4 and 5. 8.In view of rival pleadings of the parties my learned predecessor framed issues at Exh.35. I have recorded my findings thereon for the reasons given below.

The claimant also examined CW3 Prashant Shevtekar, Billing Officer Kamalnayan Bajaj Hospital, Aurangabad at Exh.52. In addition to oral evidence, claimant relied on copy of charge­sheet Exh.59, Spot Panchanama Exh.60, Copy of FIR Exh. 61, Copy of statement of Vijaya Namdeo Bangar at Exh. 62, Copy of Statement of Namdeo Ganpati Bangar at Exh. 63 Copy of registration certificate of offending truck Exh.68. , Driving licence of respondent no.1 Exh. 70, Copy of insurance policy Exh.

No.800.2015 (Judgment) evidence close Purshis vide Exh.65 & 66. AS TO ISSUES NO. 1 :­ 11.In brief, the witness examined on behalf of claimant, deposed that on 15/07/2015, claimant was traveling with her grand father and grand mother by ST Bus bearing No. MH­20­BL­ 1100 from Beed to Aurangabad. Accident took place near village Mahakala as the Bus No. MH­20­BL­1100 and Truck No. MH­23­ 4787 collided. Due accident claimant, her grand father and grand mother as well as other passengers traveling by Bus sustained injuries. It is further deposed that, claimant sustained multiple injuries to her person and thereby sustained permanent disability to the extent of 5%. He also deposed that after accident, crime has been registered against respondent No.1, who was driver of the Car at the relevant time U/ss. 279, 337, 338 of the Indian Penal Code. 12.In view of Evidence of Mahendra C.W.1 as well as evidence of Gopinath S/o Mahadev Jadhav respondent no. 4, there is no dispute about fact of accident of ST Bus and Truck involved in accident. Offene is registered against respondent no. 1 Truck Driver, respondent no. 1 has not adduced evidence to prove that, he was not negligent at the time of incident. It is also on record that, on the basis of offence registered against respondent no. 1 and fact that, he is prosecuted for the offence u/s 279, 337,338 and 427 of IPC. Spot panchanama on record at Exh. 60 clarifies position of spot of incident. As per the spot ­ 10 ­ M.A.C.P. No.800.2015 (Judgment) panchanama Exh. 60 it reveals that, accident took place towards East side of Beed­Aurangabad road, it also reveals that, there was sufficient space towards West side of the road to pass vehicle coming from opposite side. Respondent no. 1 who is eye witness has deposed that he at relevant time he was driving Bus in moderate speed by following traffic rules. Further he deposed that, he was also injured in the said accident, his claim petition is allowed by the Tribunal by directing respondent no. 1 to 3 to pay compensation as per award. 13.The evidence adduced on behalf of claimant as well as respondent no. 4 and document about prosecution of respondent no. 1 for rash and negligent act is sufficient to prove nature of incident as well as role of respondent no. 1 and 4. Therefore on the basis of oral as well as documentary evidence it can be held that, accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 1, hence I answer this issue accordingly . AS TO ISSUES NO.2 :­ 14.It is contention of claimant that, she sustained permanent injury to the extent of 5%. In support of contention witness of claimant deposed that, claimant was admitted as indoor patient in Kamalnayan Bajaj Hospital from 4/11/2015 to 5/11/2015. In support of permanent disability Dr. Shivkumar deposed that, on 4/11/2015 claimant was admitted in Kamalnayan Hospital, Aurangabad due to accidental injuries sustained to her. He further deposed that, on the basis of her clinical examination on 22/08/2016 he issued Injury Certificate Exh. 46 ­ 11 ­ M.A.C.P. No.800.2015 (Judgment) as claimant sustained multiple injuries. In column no. 13 of the application injuries sustained to claimant are mentioned “as bleeding injuries to her neck, chick, lips and other multiple injuries on her other part of body as well as face is disfigured”. In evidence of Dr. Shivkumar as well as injury certificate Exh. 46, injuries sustained to claimant are not specifically mentioned. There is no mention of disfigurement sustained to claimant. Therefore I am of the opinion that, on the basis of evidence on record it cannot be held that, claimant sustained permanent disability as stated in application as well as in certificate Exh. 46. Hence I answer this issue in negative . AS TO ISSUES NO.3 & 4 :­ 15.Coming to the quantum of compensation, claimant has claimed compensation under the heads Pecuniary Damages and Non pecuniary damages as well as special Damages such as of medical expenses, Future medical expenses, pain and suffering, special diet, on account of traveling, compensation on the ground of permanent disability and loss of enjoyment of life. Hence I have discussed as per the claim of claimant under different heads. Compensation on account of Medicines, Hospitalization etc . 16.On this head claimant has claimed compensation of Rs. 15000/­ . Claimant has examined witness Prashant Bhaskarrao Yeotekar C.W.3 at Exh. 52. He deposed that, claimant Vaishnavi was treated as OPD patient and as per Bill issued at Exh. 53 amount of Rs. 3024/­ is ­ 12 ­ M.A.C.P. No.800.2015 (Judgment) received. No other bill is filed and proved on record by claimant. Compensation is also claimed on account of future medical expenses, no evidence is adduced by the claimant to prove that, she is need of future medical treatment and expenses are required as claimed. Hence I hold that the claimant is entitle for compensation on account of medical expenses of Rs. 3024/­ . Compensation towards of mental torture agony and untold sufferings etc; Special Diet, Traveling, Loss of enjoyment of life. 17.Claimant claimed amount of Rs. 1,70,000/­ on these head. Taking in to consideration nature of injuries and pain and suffered by the claimant, in my opinion lumpsum compensation is to be awarded. Hence I am of the opinion that, amount of Rs. 25,000/­ is sufficient as compensation on these heads . Compensation on account of Permanent disability :­ 18On the point of compensation under the head of permanent disability Learned Advocate for claimant placed reliance on judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of Parminder Singh Versus New India Assurance Co. Ltd. And Others reported in 2019(3) T.A.C. 353(S.C.) and submitted that, claimant sustained grievous injury and by relying it prayed for grant of compensation. In this case Hon’ble Supreme Court enhanced compensation on the ground that, Hon’ble High Court of Panjab and Haryana committed error while computing compensation on the basis of notional income as affidavit of employer of claimant has filed affidavit about income of claimant. In this case by taking in to ­ 13 ­ M.A.C.P. No.800.2015 (Judgment) consideration functional disability of 100% as well as income of claimant, Hon’ble Supreme Court enhanced amount of compensation. From the said judgment it is clear that, for the purpose of claim of compensation on the ground of permanent disability, claimant has to prove that, he sustained such bodily injury which resulted in any permanent deformity affecting function of body, as well as it’s result on earning capacity. As discussed above doctor examined by the claimant has not stated nature of injury and it’s effect on whole body. Apart from evidence of doctor there is only injury certificate at Exh. 46 in support of injuries caused to claimant. In the injury certificate Exh. 46 it is mentioned that, due to multiple injuries claimant suffers from 5% permanent disability. Nature of injuries, it’s effect on whole body of claimant any deformity arising out affecting whole body, is not brought on record. On the other hand it is on record that, though claimant claimed that, she was admitted as indoor patient, her contention is not proved with documentary evidence. Therefore in my opinion the case relied by the learned advocate for claimant is not applicable in facts and circumstances of present case. Therefore I hold that, claimant failed to prove that, she sustained any permanent disability for the purpose of claiming compensation under this head. Therefore in my opinion she is not entitle for any compensation on this ground. 19.In view of above discussion I am of the opinion that, claimant is entitle for compensation on account of medical expenses as well as on account of pain and sufferings to the tune of Rs. 25000/­, hence in all claimant is entitle for compensation of Rs. 28024/­ . ­ 14 ­ M.A.C.P. No.800.2015 (Judgment) 20. Claimant is also entitled for interest on above amount @ 7% pa, from the date of filing of the petition till the date of realization or deposit of the entire amount. 21.Claimant claimed compensation jointly and severally from respondents. It is admitted fact that respondent no. 1 is driver and respondent no. 2 is owner of the offending vehicle involved in accident. On the basis of police papers i.e. Charge­sheet Exh.59, , respondent no.1 is prosecuted as driver of offending vehicle. On the basis of insurance certificate Exh. 38, it reveals that offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.3. Respondent no. 4 is driver of Bus who himself is injured in the said accident. As the fault on part of driver of Bus is not proved by respondent no. 1 to 3 by adducing any acceptable evidence. Therefore I am of the opinion that, respondent no. 4 being driver and respondent no. 5 being owner of Bus involved in the accident cannot be held responsible to pay compensation to claimant. Hence I hold that, only respondent no. 1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation. Hence to answer Issue No.3 accordingly and in answer to Issue No.4 , I pass following order:­ O R D E R 1]The petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs. 2]Opponents No.1 to 3 jointly and severally shall pay the compensation of Rs. 28024/­(Rs. Twenty Eight Thousand Twenty Four rupees only) to the Claimant along with interest thereon @ 7% ­ 15 ­ M.A.C.P. No.800.2015 (Judgment) per annum from the date of filing of the petition till realization of entire amount. 3]The amount if any paid on account of “No Fault Liability”, then the said amount may be deducted from the amount of compensation. 4]After depositing the amount of compensation as above be paid to the Claimant by account payee cheque. 5]Award shall be drawn accordingly, subject to payment of deficit court fee, if any. 6]Claim Petition is dismissed against Opponents No.4 & 5.

He also deposed that after accident, crime has been registered against respondent No.1, who was driver of the truck at the relevant time U/ss. 279, 337, 338 of the Indian Penal Code. 12.In view of Evidence of claimant C.W.1 as well as evidence of Gopinath S/o Mahadev Jadhav respondent no. 4, there is no dispute about fact of accident of ST Bus and Truck involved in accident. Offene is registered against respondent no. 1 Truck Driver, respondent no. 1 has not adduced evidence to prove that, he was not negligent at the time of incident. It is also on record that, on the basis of offence registered against respondent no. 1 and fact that, he is prosecuted for the offence u/s 279, 337,338 and 427 of IPC. Spot panchanama on record at Exh. 60 clarifies position of spot of incident. As per the spot panchanama Exh. 60 it reveals that, accident took place towards East side of Beed­Aurangabad road, it also reveals that, there was sufficient space towards West side of the road to pass vehicle coming from opposite side. Respondent no. 1 who is eye witness has deposed that he at relevant time he was driving Bus in moderate speed by following traffic rules.

No.801.2015 (Judgment) 13.The evidence adduced on behalf of claimant as well as respondent no. 4 and document about prosecution of respondent no. 1 for rash and negligent act are sufficient to prove nature of incident as well as role of respondent no. 1 and 4. Therefore on the basis of oral as well as documentary evidence it can be held that, accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 1 hence I answer this issue accordingly . AS TO ISSUES NO.2 :­ 14.It is contention of claimant that, she sustained permanent injury to the extent of 10%. In support of contention witness of claimant deposed that, claimant was admitted as indoor patient in Kamalnayan Bajaj Hospital from 4/11/2015 to 10/11/2015. In support of permanent disability Dr. Shivkumar deposed that, on 4/11/2015 claimant was admitted in Kamalnayan Hospital, Aurangabad due to accidental injuries sustained to him. He further deposed that, on the basis of his clinical examination on 22/08/2016 he issued Injury Certificate Exh. 47 as claimant sustained fracture of right clavicle. . In column no. 13 of the application injuries sustained to claimant are mentioned “Fracture to right hand and left knee as well as multiple injuries to other part of body”. From Discharge Summary from Kmalnayan Bajaj Hospital, Aurangabad Exh. 54 it reveals that, due to Blunt injury to RA Shoulder , Reduced & painful Rom of Right Shoulder he was unable to perform day to day activities. On clinical examination it is noticed that, there was Swelling , Deformity and Tenderness to Right Shoulder of claimant. On the basis of investigation surgery has ­ 10 ­ M.A.C.P. No.801.2015 (Judgment) been performed on claimant’s right shoulder. Taking in to consideration nature of injury it is clear that claimant is suffering from permanent impairing of the power of Right shoulder joint. Therefore I am of the opinion that, on the basis of evidence on record it can be held that, claimant sustained permanent disability. Hence I answer Issue No.2 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO. 3 :­ 15.Coming to the quantum of compensation, claimant has claimed compensation under the heads Pecuniary Damages and Non pecuniary damages as well as special Damages such as of medical expenses, Future medical expenses, pain and suffering, special diet, on account of traveling, compensation on the ground of permanent disability and loss of enjoyment of life. Hence I have discussed as per the claim of claimant under different heads. Compensation on account of Medicines, Hospitalization etc. 16.On this head claimant has claimed compensation of Rs. 1,50,000/­ . Claimant has examined witness Prashant Bhaskarrao Yeotekar C.W.3 at Exh. 53. He deposed that, claimant was treated as admitted as indoor patient on 4/11/2015 to 10/11/2015 and as per Bill issued at Exh. 55 amount of Rs. 74684/­ is received. No other bills are filed and proved on record by claimant. Compensation is also claimed on account of future medical expenses, no evidence is adduced by the claimant to prove that, he is need of future medical treatment and ­ 11 ­ M.A.C.P. No.801.2015 (Judgment) expenses are required as claimed. Hence I hold that the claimant is entitle for compensation on account of medical expenses of Rs. 74684/­. Compensation towards of mental torture agony and untold sufferings etc; Special Diet, Traveling, Loss of enjoyment of life. 17.Claimant claimed amount of Rs. 1,20,000/­ on these head. Taking in to consideration nature of injuries and pain and suffered by the claimant, in my opinion lumpsum compensation is to be awarded. Hence I am of the opinion that, amount of Rs. 50,000/­ is sufficient as compensation on these heads . Compensation on account of Permanent disability :­ 18On the point of compensation under the head of permanent disability Learned Advocate for claimant placed reliance on judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of Parminder Singh Versus New India Assurance Co. Ltd. And Others reported in 2019(3) T.A.C. 353(S.C.) and submitted that, claimant sustained grievous injury and by relying it prayed for grant of compensation. In this case Hon’ble Supreme Court enhanced compensation on the ground that, Hon’ble High Court of Panjab and Haryana committed error while computing compensation on the basis of notional income as affidavit of employer of claimant has filed affidavit about income of claimant. In this case by taking in to consideration functional disability of 100% as well as income of claimant, Hon’ble Supreme Court enhanced amount of compensation. 19.Form the said judgment it is clear that, for the purpose of ­ 12 ­ M.A.C.P. No.801.2015 (Judgment) claim of compensation on the ground of permanent disability, claimant has to prove that, he sustained such bodily injury which resulted in any permanent deformity affecting function of body, as well as it’s result on earning capacity. As discussed above doctor examined by the claimant has not stated nature of injury and it’s effect on whole body. Apart from evidence of doctor there is only injury certificate at Exh. 47 in support of injuries caused to claimant. In the injury certificate Exh. 47 it is mentioned that, due to multiple injuries claimant suffers from 10% permanent disability. Nature of injuries, it’s effect on whole body of claimant any deformity arising out affecting whole body, is not brought on record. On the other hand it is on record that, though claimant claimed that, he sustained fracture to his left knee no such injury is on record. Therefore in my opinion the case relied by the learned advocate for claimant is not applicable in facts and circumstances of present case. Therefore I hold that, claimant failed to prove that, he sustained any permanent disability for the purpose of claiming compensation under this head. Therefore in my opinion he is not entitle for any compensation on this ground. 20.In view of above discussion I am of the opinion that, claimant is entitle for compensation on account of medical expenses Rs.74,684/­ as well as on account of pain and sufferings to the tune of Rs. 50000/­ hence in all claimant is entitle for compensation of Rs. 1,24,684/­. 21.. Claimant is also entitled for interest on above amount @ 7% pa, from the date of filing of the petition till the date of realization or ­ 13 ­ M.A.C.P. No.801.2015 (Judgment) deposit of the entire amount. 22.Claimant claimed compensation jointly and severally from respondents. It is admitted fact that respondent no. 1 is driver and respondent no. 2 is owner of the offending truck involved in accident. On the basis of police papers i.e. FIR Exh.64 , respondent no.1 is prosecuted as driver of offending vehicle. On the basis of insurance certificate Exh. 67, it reveals that offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.3. Respondent no. 4 is driver of Bus who himself is injured in the said accident. As the fault on part of driver of Bus is not proved by respondent no. 1 to 3 by adducing any acceptable evidence. Therefore I am of the opinion that, respondent no. 4 being driver and respondent no. 5 being owner of Bus involved in the accident cannot be held responsible to pay compensation to claimant. Hence I hold that, only respondent no. 1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation. Hence I answer Issue No.3 accordingly and in answer to issue No.4, I pass following order:­ O R D E R 1]The petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs. 2]Opponents No.1 to 3 jointly and severally shall pay the compensation of Rs. 1,24,684/­(Rs. One Lakh twenty four thousand six hundred eighty four rupees only) to the Claimant along with interest thereon ­ 14 ­ M.A.C.P.

Shaikh, Advocate for Resp. No.5. _______________________________________________ JUDGEMENT ( Delivered on 29/11/2019 ) - 3 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) 1.This is an application under Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, for compensation due to injuries sustained in motor vehicular accident. 2.The brief facts, stated by applicant are as below :­ It is the contention of the claimant that on 04/11/2015, She was traveling with her husbabd and grand daughter by S.T. Bus bearing No. MH­20­BL­1100, from Beed to Aurangabad. When said S.T. Bus reached ahead village Mahakala Phata, at 2­30 pm, one truck bearing No. MH­23­4787 came from opposite side and as the drivers of both vehicles i.e. Truck and S.T. Bus were driving their respective vehicles in a very high and excessive speed and in a very rash and negligent manner colluded due to which the accident took place. Due to said accident the claimant, her husbabd, grand daughter, and other persons travailing in the said bus were injured. 3.It is further contended by the claimant that the crime No. I­ 190/2015, was registered against respondent no.1 – driver of offending Truck, U/ss. 279,337, 338, 427 of IPC. In the said accident, the claimant sustained fracture injuries to her right leg, right hand arm was fractured. The claimant was shifted in Kamalnayan Bajaj Hospital, Aurangabad and she was admitted there from 04/11/2015 to 10/11/2015, as an indoor patient. During the course of medical treatment the concern doctors have operated her. The claimant had incurred medical expenses of Rs.3,00,000/­ for medicines, and hospitalization. Since the date of accident the claimant is taking regular - 4 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) medical treatment. Doctor advised the claimant that she is in need of future medical treatment for that purpose the claimant requires Rs.60,000/­. Prior to accident the claimant was leading her life happily. She use to do tailoring work and earn Rs. 250­300 per day. She use to contribute her income for maintainance of house and familys. Due to injuries she is now unable to walk and move on her own. Therefore, the claimant claimed compensation of Rs. 11,00,000/­ and ristricted her claim to the tune of Rs.6,00,000/­ from the respondents jointly and severally. 4.Respondents No.1 & 2 filed their written statement at Exh.31 and denied the claim of claimant. It is contended by these respondents that Gondi Police Station Dist. Jalna has not rightly investigated the crime and registered the offence against respondent no.1 i.e. driver of Truck No. MH­23­4787. There was no negligence on the part of said truck driver. The driver of said truck was tried to save S.T. Bus bearing No. MH­20­BL­1100 but in­vain and accident happened. These respondents also denied the manner in which accident was happened and specifically denied about injuries caused to claimant as well as denied medical expenses. It is contended by these respondents that their vehicle was insured with respondent No.3 – United India General Insurance company which is effective for the period from 18/11/2014 to 17/11/2015. They contended that if the liability comes towards said respondents, then respondent No.3 insurer of the said truck is liable for the said liability. They contended that the - 5 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) claim of rupees two lakhs is highly excessive and exorbitant. Lastly they prayed for dismissal of the claim petition. 5.The respondent No.3 – United India Insurance Company filed its written statement at Exh.21 and specifically denied about injuries, treatment obtained by claimant from Kamalnayan Bajaj Hospital and about medical expenses to the tune of Rs.1,50,000/­ incurred by the claimant. They denied about rash and negligent driving of Truck No.MH­23­4787. They contended that the accident in question had taken place due to sole negligent act on the part of respondent No.4 i.e. driver of S.T. Bus. It is contended that the crime was registered on the report lodged by respondent No.4 i.e. S.T. Driver. It is contended that at the time of accident, the respondent No.1 was driving the vehicle without holding any valid and effective driving license. It is contended that the said truck was being plied on the road without any valid permit and fitness on the date of accident, hence it is fundamental breach of policy. It is contended that the claimant did not sustain any sort of injury which can be converted into permanent disability. It is contended that the claim is excessive, exorbitant and baseless, hence same is liable to be dismissed. Respondent no.3 lastly prayed for dismissal of the claim petition. 6.Respondent No.4 – filed his written statement at Exh.32 and denied the contents of Para No.1 to 22 being incorrect. It is specifically denied that on the day of accident, the claimant, her grand mother and grand father were traveling in S.T. Bus No. MH­20­BL­1100. It is denied that he was driving his S.T. Bus in a very rash and negligent - 6 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) manner and gave dash to Truck No. MH­23­4787. It is denied that the claimant, grand mother and grand father sustained injuries on their person. Respondent no.4 has no concern whatsoever with the alleged accident, however, the claimant has deliberately and intentionally made party to the present respondent No.4. The crime is registered against respondent no.1 – truck driver on his complaint and it is required to be taken into consideration. No cross complaint is filed against him by the truck driver. In short, he denied that the claimant was admitted in hospital and incurred Rs.3,00,000/­ for treatment. It is contended by this respondent that the claim of claimant is exorbitant and excessive and prayed for dismissal of the claim. 7.The respondent no.5 – MSRTC filed its written statement vide Exh.28 and denied the claim of the claimant. It is contended that the crime has been registered against truck driver only i.e. respondent No.1. It is contended that all the drivers and Conductors of ST Bus are well trained and after giving necessary training, they allowed to work on public road. The police authority has rightly lodged the crime against the driver of truck bearing No. MH­23­4787 i.e. respondent No.1 and in the entire police papers there is nothing against ST Bus about negligence. It is lastly contended that the accident is occurred only on the fault of driver of truck bearing No. MH­23­4787, therefore claim petition is liable to be dismissed against respondents No.4 and 5. 8.In view of rival pleadings of the parties my learned predecessor framed issues at Exh.35. I have recorded my findings thereon for the reasons given below. - 7 - M.A.C.P.

Taking in to consideration nature of injury it is clear that claimant is suffering from permanent impairing of the power of Right arm, leg. Therefore I am of the opinion that, on the basis of evidence on record it can be held that, claimant sustained permanent disability . Hence I answer Issue No.2 in the affirmative . AS TO ISSUE NO.3 & 4 :­ 15.Coming to the quantum of compensation, claimant has claimed compensation under the heads Pecuniary Damages and Non pecuniary damages as well as special Damages such as of medical expenses, Future medical expenses, pain and suffering, special diet, on account of traveling, compensation on the ground of permanent - 11 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) disability and loss of enjoyment of life. Hence I have discussed as per the claim of claimant under different heads. Compensation on account of Medicines, Hospitalization etc . 16.On this head claimant has claimed compensation of Rs. 3,00,000/­ . Claimant has examined witness Prashant Bhaskarrao Yeotekar C.W.3 at Exh. 52.

No.802.2015 (Judgment) Compensation on account of loss of future income capacity:­ 18.On the point of compensation under the head of loss of future income capacity. Learnded Advocate for claimant placed reliance on judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of Parminder Singh Versus New India Assurance Co. Ltd. And Others reported in 2019(3) T.A.C. 353(S.C.) and submitted that, claimant sustained grievous injury and by relying it prayed for grant of compensation. In this case Hon’ble Supreme Court enhannanced compensation on the ground that, Hon’ble High Court of Panjab and Haryana committed error while computing compensation on the basis of notional income as affidavit of employer of claimant has filed affidavit about income of claimant. In this case by taking in to consideration functional disability of 100% as well as income of claimant, Hon’ble Supreme Court enhannanced amount of compensation. 19.Form the said judgment it is clear that, for the purpose of claim of compensation on the ground of permanent disability, claimant has to prove that, she sustained such bodily injury which resulted in any permanent deformity affecting function of body, as well as it’s result on earning capacity. As discussed above doctor examined by the claimant has not stated nature of injury and it’s effect on whole body. Apart from evidence of doctor there is only injury certificate at Exh. 47 in support of injuries caused to claimant. In the injury certificate Exh. 47 it is mentioned that, due to multiple injuries claimant suffers from 40% permanent disability. Dr. Shivkumar in his cross­examination admitted that, operation performed on claimant is successful, further he admitted - 13 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) that, fracture are united and healed, he also admitted that, claimant is able to do her routine work. He further admitted that, he issued certificate completion arising out of injuries. Nature of injuries, it’s effect on whole body of claimant any deformity arising out affecting whole body, is not brought on record. Therefore in my opinion the case relied by the learned advocate for claimant is not applicable in facts and circumstances of present case. Therefore I hold that, claimant failed to prove that, she sustained any permanent disability for the purpose of claiming compensation on the ground of loss of future income capacity. Therefore in my opinion she is not entitle for any compensation on this ground. 20.In view of above discussion I am of the opinion that, claimant is entitle for compensation following is summary of compensation granted to claimant: Head Amount Compensation for medical expenses Rs. 79697/­ Compensation for future medical expenses Rs. 50,000/­ Compensation for mental torture agony and untold sufferings etc; Special Diet, Traveling, Loss of enjoyment of life. Rs. 1,20,000/­ Total Rs. 2,49,697/­ 21. Claimant is also entitled for interest on above amount @ 7% pa, from the date of filing of the petition till the date of realization or deposit of the entire amount. - 14 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) 22.Claimant claimed compensation jointly and severally from respondents. It is admitted fact that respondent no. 1 is driver and respondent no. 2 is owner of the offending truck involved in accident. On the basis of police papers i.e. FIR Exh.64 , respondent no.1 is prosecuted as driver of offending vehicle. On the basis of insurance certificate Exh. 67, it reveals that offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.3. Respondent no. 4 is driver of Bus who himself is injured in the said accident. As the fault on part of driver of Bus is not proved by respondent no. 1 to 3 by adducing any acceptable evidence. Therefore I am of the opinion that, respondent no. 4 being driver and respondent no. 5 being owner of Bus involved in the accident cannot be held responsible to pay compensation to claimant. Hence I hold that, only respondent no. 1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation.

No.802.2015 (Judgment) 1.This is an application under Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, for compensation due to injuries sustained in motor vehicular accident. 2.The brief facts, stated by applicant are as below :­ It is the contention of the claimant that on 04/11/2015, She was traveling with her husbabd and grand daughter by S.T. Bus bearing No. MH­20­BL­1100, from Beed to Aurangabad. When said S.T. Bus reached ahead village Mahakala Phata, at 2­30 pm, one truck bearing No. MH­23­4787 came from opposite side and as the drivers of both vehicles i.e. Truck and S.T. Bus were driving their respective vehicles in a very high and excessive speed and in a very rash and negligent manner colluded due to which the accident took place. Due to said accident the claimant, her husbabd, grand daughter, and other persons travailing in the said bus were injured. 3.It is further contended by the claimant that the crime No. I­ 190/2015, was registered against respondent no.1 – driver of offending Truck, U/ss. 279,337, 338, 427 of IPC. In the said accident, the claimant sustained fracture injuries to her right leg, right hand arm was fractured. The claimant was shifted in Kamalnayan Bajaj Hospital, Aurangabad and she was admitted there from 04/11/2015 to 10/11/2015, as an indoor patient. During the course of medical treatment the concern doctors have operated her. The claimant had incurred medical expenses of Rs.3,00,000/­ for medicines, and hospitalization. Since the date of accident the claimant is taking regular - 4 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) medical treatment. Doctor advised the claimant that she is in need of future medical treatment for that purpose the claimant requires Rs.60,000/­. Prior to accident the claimant was leading her life happily. She use to do tailoring work and earn Rs. 250­300 per day. She use to contribute her income for maintainance of house and familys. Due to injuries she is now unable to walk and move on her own. Therefore, the claimant claimed compensation of Rs. 11,00,000/­ and ristricted her claim to the tune of Rs.6,00,000/­ from the respondents jointly and severally. 4.Respondents No.1 & 2 filed their written statement at Exh.31 and denied the claim of claimant. It is contended by these respondents that Gondi Police Station Dist. Jalna has not rightly investigated the crime and registered the offence against respondent no.1 i.e. driver of Truck No. MH­23­4787. There was no negligence on the part of said truck driver. The driver of said truck was tried to save S.T. Bus bearing No. MH­20­BL­1100 but in­vain and accident happened. These respondents also denied the manner in which accident was happened and specifically denied about injuries caused to claimant as well as denied medical expenses. It is contended by these respondents that their vehicle was insured with respondent No.3 – United India General Insurance company which is effective for the period from 18/11/2014 to 17/11/2015. They contended that if the liability comes towards said respondents, then respondent No.3 insurer of the said truck is liable for the said liability. They contended that the - 5 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) claim of rupees two lakhs is highly excessive and exorbitant. Lastly they prayed for dismissal of the claim petition. 5.The respondent No.3 – United India Insurance Company filed its written statement at Exh.21 and specifically denied about injuries, treatment obtained by claimant from Kamalnayan Bajaj Hospital and about medical expenses to the tune of Rs.1,50,000/­ incurred by the claimant. They denied about rash and negligent driving of Truck No.MH­23­4787. They contended that the accident in question had taken place due to sole negligent act on the part of respondent No.4 i.e. driver of S.T. Bus. It is contended that the crime was registered on the report lodged by respondent No.4 i.e. S.T. Driver. It is contended that at the time of accident, the respondent No.1 was driving the vehicle without holding any valid and effective driving license. It is contended that the said truck was being plied on the road without any valid permit and fitness on the date of accident, hence it is fundamental breach of policy. It is contended that the claimant did not sustain any sort of injury which can be converted into permanent disability. It is contended that the claim is excessive, exorbitant and baseless, hence same is liable to be dismissed. Respondent no.3 lastly prayed for dismissal of the claim petition. 6.Respondent No.4 – filed his written statement at Exh.32 and denied the contents of Para No.1 to 22 being incorrect. It is specifically denied that on the day of accident, the claimant, her grand mother and grand father were traveling in S.T. Bus No. MH­20­BL­1100. It is denied that he was driving his S.T. Bus in a very rash and negligent - 6 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) manner and gave dash to Truck No. MH­23­4787. It is denied that the claimant, grand mother and grand father sustained injuries on their person. Respondent no.4 has no concern whatsoever with the alleged accident, however, the claimant has deliberately and intentionally made party to the present respondent No.4. The crime is registered against respondent no.1 – truck driver on his complaint and it is required to be taken into consideration. No cross complaint is filed against him by the truck driver. In short, he denied that the claimant was admitted in hospital and incurred Rs.3,00,000/­ for treatment. It is contended by this respondent that the claim of claimant is exorbitant and excessive and prayed for dismissal of the claim. 7.The respondent no.5 – MSRTC filed its written statement vide Exh.28 and denied the claim of the claimant. It is contended that the crime has been registered against truck driver only i.e. respondent No.1. It is contended that all the drivers and Conductors of ST Bus are well trained and after giving necessary training, they allowed to work on public road. The police authority has rightly lodged the crime against the driver of truck bearing No. MH­23­4787 i.e. respondent No.1 and in the entire police papers there is nothing against ST Bus about negligence. It is lastly contended that the accident is occurred only on the fault of driver of truck bearing No. MH­23­4787, therefore claim petition is liable to be dismissed against respondents No.4 and 5. 8.In view of rival pleadings of the parties my learned predecessor framed issues at Exh.35. I have recorded my findings thereon for the reasons given below. - 7 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) POINTS FINDINGS 1Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of Truck bearing registration No. MH­23­4787 and S.T.

Accident took place near village Mahakala as the Bus No. MH­20­BL­1100 and Truck No. MH­ 23­4787 collided. Due accident claimant, her husband and grand daughter as well as other passengers traveling by Bus sustained injuries.

She also deposed that after accident, crime has been registered against respondent No.1, who was driver of the truck at the relevant time U/ss. 279, 337, 338 of the Indian Penal Code. 12.In view of Evidence of claimant C.W.1 as well as evidence of Gopinath S/o Mahadev Jadhav respondent no. 4, there is no dispute about fact of accident of ST Bus and Truck involved in accident. Offene is registered against respondent no. 1 Truck Driver, respondent no. 1 has not adduced evidence to prove that, he was not negligent at the time of incident. It is also on record that, on the basis of offence - 9 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) registered against respondent no. 1 and fact that, he is prosecuted for the offence u/s 279, 337,338 and 427 of IPC. Spot panchanama on record at Exh. 63 clarifies position of spot of incident. As per the spot panchanama Exh. 63 it reveals that, accident took place towards East side of Beed­Aurangabad road, it also reveals that, there was sufficient space towards West side of the road to pass vehicle coming from opposite side. Respondent no. 4 who is eye witness has deposed that he at relevant time he was driving Bus in moderate speed by following traffic rules.

Therefore on the basis of oral as well as documentary evidence it can be held that, accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 1, hence I answer this issue accordingly . AS TO ISSUES NO.2 :­ 14.It is contention of claimant that, she sustained permanent injury to the extent of 40%. In support of contention witness of claimant deposed that, claimant was admitted as indoor patient in Kamalnayan Bajaj Hospital from 4/11/2015 to 10/11/2015.

No.802.2015 (Judgment) claimant was admitted in Kamalnayan Hospital, Aurangabad due to accidental injuries sustained to her. He further deposed that, on the basis of his clinical examination on 22/08/2016 he issued Injury Certificate Exh. 47 as claimant sustained fracture of Right Humery, Fracture of Right Leg Head Injury, Fracture left Zygmadic bone.

On clinical examination it is noticed that, there was Swelling , Deformity and Tenderness to Right arm, leg and CLW over left temporal region of claimant. On the basis of invistigation surgery has been performed on claimant’s ORIF with Humerus plating with CRIF with IM nailin gfor tibia. Taking in to consideration nature of injury it is clear that claimant is suffering from permanent impairing of the power of Right arm, leg. Therefore I am of the opinion that, on the basis of evidence on record it can be held that, claimant sustained permanent disability . Hence I answer Issue No.2 in the affirmative . AS TO ISSUE NO.3 & 4 :­ 15.Coming to the quantum of compensation, claimant has claimed compensation under the heads Pecuniary Damages and Non pecuniary damages as well as special Damages such as of medical expenses, Future medical expenses, pain and suffering, special diet, on account of traveling, compensation on the ground of permanent - 11 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) disability and loss of enjoyment of life. Hence I have discussed as per the claim of claimant under different heads. Compensation on account of Medicines, Hospitalization etc . 16.On this head claimant has claimed compensation of Rs. 3,00,000/­ . Claimant has examined witness Prashant Bhaskarrao Yeotekar C.W.3 at Exh. 52. He deposed that, claimant was treated as admitted as indoor patient on 4/11/2015 to 10/11/2015 and as per Bill issued at Exh. 55 amount of Rs. 79697/­ is received. No other bills are filed and proved on record by claimant. Compensation is also claimed on account of future medical expenses, Dr. Shivkumar deposed that, he advoiced claimant to remove implant used during surgery. Taking in to consideration his evidence I am of the opinion that, lumpsum amount is required to be granted for future medical tratment. Hence I grant lumpsum compensation of Rs. 50,000/­. Hence I that the claimant is entitle for compensation on account of medical expenses of Rs. 79697/­ as well as Rs.50,000/­ for future medical treatment . Compensation towards of mental torture agony and untold sufferings etc; Special Diet, Traveling, Loss of enjoyment of life. 17.Claimant claimed amount of Rs. 1,20,000/­ on these head. Taking in to consideration nature of injuries and pain suffered by the claimant, in my opinion injurious are grevious having long term effect on body of the claimant, hence in my opinion the amount claimed on these heads is justifiable, the claimant is entitle for it. - 12 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) Compensation on account of loss of future income capacity:­ 18.On the point of compensation under the head of loss of future income capacity. Learnded Advocate for claimant placed reliance on judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of Parminder Singh Versus New India Assurance Co. Ltd. And Others reported in 2019(3) T.A.C. 353(S.C.) and submitted that, claimant sustained grievous injury and by relying it prayed for grant of compensation. In this case Hon’ble Supreme Court enhannanced compensation on the ground that, Hon’ble High Court of Panjab and Haryana committed error while computing compensation on the basis of notional income as affidavit of employer of claimant has filed affidavit about income of claimant. In this case by taking in to consideration functional disability of 100% as well as income of claimant, Hon’ble Supreme Court enhannanced amount of compensation. 19.Form the said judgment it is clear that, for the purpose of claim of compensation on the ground of permanent disability, claimant has to prove that, she sustained such bodily injury which resulted in any permanent deformity affecting function of body, as well as it’s result on earning capacity. As discussed above doctor examined by the claimant has not stated nature of injury and it’s effect on whole body. Apart from evidence of doctor there is only injury certificate at Exh. 47 in support of injuries caused to claimant. In the injury certificate Exh. 47 it is mentioned that, due to multiple injuries claimant suffers from 40% permanent disability. Dr. Shivkumar in his cross­examination admitted that, operation performed on claimant is successful, further he admitted - 13 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) that, fracture are united and healed, he also admitted that, claimant is able to do her routine work. He further admitted that, he issued certificate completion arising out of injuries. Nature of injuries, it’s effect on whole body of claimant any deformity arising out affecting whole body, is not brought on record. Therefore in my opinion the case relied by the learned advocate for claimant is not applicable in facts and circumstances of present case. Therefore I hold that, claimant failed to prove that, she sustained any permanent disability for the purpose of claiming compensation on the ground of loss of future income capacity. Therefore in my opinion she is not entitle for any compensation on this ground. 20.In view of above discussion I am of the opinion that, claimant is entitle for compensation following is summary of compensation granted to claimant: Head Amount Compensation for medical expenses Rs. 79697/­ Compensation for future medical expenses Rs. 50,000/­ Compensation for mental torture agony and untold sufferings etc; Special Diet, Traveling, Loss of enjoyment of life. Rs. 1,20,000/­ Total Rs. 2,49,697/­ 21. Claimant is also entitled for interest on above amount @ 7% pa, from the date of filing of the petition till the date of realization or deposit of the entire amount. - 14 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) 22.Claimant claimed compensation jointly and severally from respondents. It is admitted fact that respondent no. 1 is driver and respondent no. 2 is owner of the offending truck involved in accident. On the basis of police papers i.e. FIR Exh.64 , respondent no.1 is prosecuted as driver of offending vehicle. On the basis of insurance certificate Exh. 67, it reveals that offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.3. Respondent no. 4 is driver of Bus who himself is injured in the said accident. As the fault on part of driver of Bus is not proved by respondent no. 1 to 3 by adducing any acceptable evidence. Therefore I am of the opinion that, respondent no. 4 being driver and respondent no. 5 being owner of Bus involved in the accident cannot be held responsible to pay compensation to claimant. Hence I hold that, only respondent no. 1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation. Hence I answer Issue No.3 accordingly and in answer to Issue No.4, I pass following order :­ O R D E R 1]The petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs. 2]Opponents No.1 to 3 jointly and severally shall pay the compensation of Rs.2,49,697 /­(Rs. Two Lakh fortynine thousand six hundred nintyseven rupees only) to the Claimant along with interest thereon @ 7% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till realization of entire amount. - 15 - M.A.C.P.

Bus in a very rash and negligent - 6 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) manner and gave dash to Truck No. MH­23­4787. It is denied that the claimant, grand mother and grand father sustained injuries on their person. Respondent no.4 has no concern whatsoever with the alleged accident, however, the claimant has deliberately and intentionally made party to the present respondent No.4. The crime is registered against respondent no.1 – truck driver on his complaint and it is required to be taken into consideration. No cross complaint is filed against him by the truck driver. In short, he denied that the claimant was admitted in hospital and incurred Rs.3,00,000/­ for treatment. It is contended by this respondent that the claim of claimant is exorbitant and excessive and prayed for dismissal of the claim. 7.The respondent no.5 – MSRTC filed its written statement vide Exh.28 and denied the claim of the claimant. It is contended that the crime has been registered against truck driver only i.e. respondent No.1. It is contended that all the drivers and Conductors of ST Bus are well trained and after giving necessary training, they allowed to work on public road. The police authority has rightly lodged the crime against the driver of truck bearing No. MH­23­4787 i.e. respondent No.1 and in the entire police papers there is nothing against ST Bus about negligence. It is lastly contended that the accident is occurred only on the fault of driver of truck bearing No. MH­23­4787, therefore claim petition is liable to be dismissed against respondents No.4 and 5. 8.In view of rival pleadings of the parties my learned predecessor framed issues at Exh.35. I have recorded my findings thereon for the reasons given below. - 7 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) POINTS FINDINGS 1Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of Truck bearing registration No. MH­23­4787 and S.T.

Respondent no.4 adduced his evidence below Exh.57 and filed evidence close purshis vide Exh.58, Respondent No. 5 filed evidence close purshis vide Exh.60 AS TO ISSUES NO. 1 :­ 11.In brief, the claimant, deposed that on 15/07/2015, she was traveling with husband and grand daughter by ST Bus bearing No. MH­20­BL­1100 from Beed to Aurangabad. Accident took place near village Mahakala as the Bus No. MH­20­BL­1100 and Truck No. MH­ 23­4787 collided. Due accident claimant, her husband and grand daughter as well as other passengers traveling by Bus sustained injuries. It is further deposed that, her right leg, Head injury , she also sustained inuries to other parts of his body. Due to injuries she is permanently disabled to the extent of 40%. She also deposed that after accident, crime has been registered against respondent No.1, who was driver of the truck at the relevant time U/ss. 279, 337, 338 of the Indian Penal Code. 12.In view of Evidence of claimant C.W.1 as well as evidence of Gopinath S/o Mahadev Jadhav respondent no. 4, there is no dispute about fact of accident of ST Bus and Truck involved in accident. Offene is registered against respondent no. 1 Truck Driver, respondent no. 1 has not adduced evidence to prove that, he was not negligent at the time of incident. It is also on record that, on the basis of offence - 9 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) registered against respondent no. 1 and fact that, he is prosecuted for the offence u/s 279, 337,338 and 427 of IPC. Spot panchanama on record at Exh. 63 clarifies position of spot of incident. As per the spot panchanama Exh. 63 it reveals that, accident took place towards East side of Beed­Aurangabad road, it also reveals that, there was sufficient space towards West side of the road to pass vehicle coming from opposite side. Respondent no. 4 who is eye witness has deposed that he at relevant time he was driving Bus in moderate speed by following traffic rules. Further he deposed that, he was also injured in the said accident, his claim petition is allowed by the Tribunal by directing respondent no. 1 to 3 to pay compensation as per award. 13.The evidence adduced on behalf of claimant as well as respondent no. 4 and document about prosecution of respondent no. 1 for rash and negligent act are sufficient to prove nature of incident as well as role of respondent no. 1 and 4. Therefore on the basis of oral as well as documentary evidence it can be held that, accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 1, hence I answer this issue accordingly . AS TO ISSUES NO.2 :­ 14.It is contention of claimant that, she sustained permanent injury to the extent of 40%. In support of contention witness of claimant deposed that, claimant was admitted as indoor patient in Kamalnayan Bajaj Hospital from 4/11/2015 to 10/11/2015. In support of permanent disability Dr. Shivkumar deposed that, on 4/11/2015 - 10 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) claimant was admitted in Kamalnayan Hospital, Aurangabad due to accidental injuries sustained to her. He further deposed that, on the basis of his clinical examination on 22/08/2016 he issued Injury Certificate Exh. 47 as claimant sustained fracture of Right Humery, Fracture of Right Leg Head Injury, Fracture left Zygmadic bone. From Discharge Summary from Kmalnayan Bajaj Hospital, Aurangabad Exh. 53 it reveals that, claimant approached to their hospital due to complaint of pain and swelling over right arm and leg, bleeding from wound over right leg and forehead, unable to move right oforearm and leg and no nause, vommitting, gidness. On clinical examination it is noticed that, there was Swelling , Deformity and Tenderness to Right arm, leg and CLW over left temporal region of claimant. On the basis of invistigation surgery has been performed on claimant’s ORIF with Humerus plating with CRIF with IM nailin gfor tibia. Taking in to consideration nature of injury it is clear that claimant is suffering from permanent impairing of the power of Right arm, leg. Therefore I am of the opinion that, on the basis of evidence on record it can be held that, claimant sustained permanent disability . Hence I answer Issue No.2 in the affirmative . AS TO ISSUE NO.3 & 4 :­ 15.Coming to the quantum of compensation, claimant has claimed compensation under the heads Pecuniary Damages and Non pecuniary damages as well as special Damages such as of medical expenses, Future medical expenses, pain and suffering, special diet, on account of traveling, compensation on the ground of permanent - 11 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) disability and loss of enjoyment of life. Hence I have discussed as per the claim of claimant under different heads. Compensation on account of Medicines, Hospitalization etc . 16.On this head claimant has claimed compensation of Rs. 3,00,000/­ . Claimant has examined witness Prashant Bhaskarrao Yeotekar C.W.3 at Exh. 52. He deposed that, claimant was treated as admitted as indoor patient on 4/11/2015 to 10/11/2015 and as per Bill issued at Exh. 55 amount of Rs. 79697/­ is received. No other bills are filed and proved on record by claimant. Compensation is also claimed on account of future medical expenses, Dr. Shivkumar deposed that, he advoiced claimant to remove implant used during surgery. Taking in to consideration his evidence I am of the opinion that, lumpsum amount is required to be granted for future medical tratment. Hence I grant lumpsum compensation of Rs. 50,000/­. Hence I that the claimant is entitle for compensation on account of medical expenses of Rs. 79697/­ as well as Rs.50,000/­ for future medical treatment . Compensation towards of mental torture agony and untold sufferings etc; Special Diet, Traveling, Loss of enjoyment of life. 17.Claimant claimed amount of Rs. 1,20,000/­ on these head. Taking in to consideration nature of injuries and pain suffered by the claimant, in my opinion injurious are grevious having long term effect on body of the claimant, hence in my opinion the amount claimed on these heads is justifiable, the claimant is entitle for it. - 12 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) Compensation on account of loss of future income capacity:­ 18.On the point of compensation under the head of loss of future income capacity. Learnded Advocate for claimant placed reliance on judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of Parminder Singh Versus New India Assurance Co. Ltd. And Others reported in 2019(3) T.A.C. 353(S.C.) and submitted that, claimant sustained grievous injury and by relying it prayed for grant of compensation. In this case Hon’ble Supreme Court enhannanced compensation on the ground that, Hon’ble High Court of Panjab and Haryana committed error while computing compensation on the basis of notional income as affidavit of employer of claimant has filed affidavit about income of claimant. In this case by taking in to consideration functional disability of 100% as well as income of claimant, Hon’ble Supreme Court enhannanced amount of compensation. 19.Form the said judgment it is clear that, for the purpose of claim of compensation on the ground of permanent disability, claimant has to prove that, she sustained such bodily injury which resulted in any permanent deformity affecting function of body, as well as it’s result on earning capacity. As discussed above doctor examined by the claimant has not stated nature of injury and it’s effect on whole body. Apart from evidence of doctor there is only injury certificate at Exh. 47 in support of injuries caused to claimant. In the injury certificate Exh. 47 it is mentioned that, due to multiple injuries claimant suffers from 40% permanent disability. Dr. Shivkumar in his cross­examination admitted that, operation performed on claimant is successful, further he admitted - 13 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) that, fracture are united and healed, he also admitted that, claimant is able to do her routine work. He further admitted that, he issued certificate completion arising out of injuries. Nature of injuries, it’s effect on whole body of claimant any deformity arising out affecting whole body, is not brought on record. Therefore in my opinion the case relied by the learned advocate for claimant is not applicable in facts and circumstances of present case. Therefore I hold that, claimant failed to prove that, she sustained any permanent disability for the purpose of claiming compensation on the ground of loss of future income capacity. Therefore in my opinion she is not entitle for any compensation on this ground. 20.In view of above discussion I am of the opinion that, claimant is entitle for compensation following is summary of compensation granted to claimant: Head Amount Compensation for medical expenses Rs. 79697/­ Compensation for future medical expenses Rs. 50,000/­ Compensation for mental torture agony and untold sufferings etc; Special Diet, Traveling, Loss of enjoyment of life. Rs. 1,20,000/­ Total Rs. 2,49,697/­ 21. Claimant is also entitled for interest on above amount @ 7% pa, from the date of filing of the petition till the date of realization or deposit of the entire amount. - 14 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) 22.Claimant claimed compensation jointly and severally from respondents. It is admitted fact that respondent no. 1 is driver and respondent no. 2 is owner of the offending truck involved in accident. On the basis of police papers i.e. FIR Exh.64 , respondent no.1 is prosecuted as driver of offending vehicle. On the basis of insurance certificate Exh. 67, it reveals that offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.3. Respondent no. 4 is driver of Bus who himself is injured in the said accident. As the fault on part of driver of Bus is not proved by respondent no. 1 to 3 by adducing any acceptable evidence. Therefore I am of the opinion that, respondent no. 4 being driver and respondent no. 5 being owner of Bus involved in the accident cannot be held responsible to pay compensation to claimant. Hence I hold that, only respondent no. 1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation. Hence I answer Issue No.3 accordingly and in answer to Issue No.4, I pass following order :­ O R D E R 1]The petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs. 2]Opponents No.1 to 3 jointly and severally shall pay the compensation of Rs.2,49,697 /­(Rs. Two Lakh fortynine thousand six hundred nintyseven rupees only) to the Claimant along with interest thereon @ 7% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till realization of entire amount. - 15 - M.A.C.P. No.802.2015 (Judgment) 3]The amount if any paid on account of “No Fault Liability”, then the said amount may be deducted from the amount of compensation. 4]After depositing the amount of compensation as above be paid to the Claimant by account payee cheque. 5]Award shall be drawn accordingly, subject to payment of deficit court fee, if any. 6]Claim petition is dismissed against opponents No.4 & 5.

Claim :­ Petition under section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 for compensation of Rs.10,00,000/­ _______________________________________ Shri S.N. Sonne, Advocate for claimants Shri F.R. Shaikh, Advocate for Respondents _______________________________________ JUDGMENT (Delivered on : 08.03.2017) 1.The present petition is filed under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 seeking compensation of Rs.10,00,000/­ due to accidental death of Thansing Trimbak Chavan in the motor vehicular accident. 2.Brief facts giving rise to this petition are as under :­ On 20.04.2015 at about 4.00 hours Thansing Chavan was travelling on motorcycle bearing registration 3 M.A.C.P. No.308/2015 [Judgment] No.MH­19­BW­2678 from Malkapur towards Muktai Nagar as a pillion rider. The motorcycle was being driven by his friend Lakhichand Deshmukh Rathod in a slow and moderate speed and by following traffic rules and regulations. When said motorcycle reached near Muktai Nagar Sakhar Karkhana, at that time, one S.T.

In the said accident, Thansing Chavan sustained grievous injuries. After the accident, he was shifted to Civil Hospital, Jalgaon where he was declared dead. 3.After the accident, Crime No.I­68/2015 u/s. 279,337,338,427,304(A) of I.P.C. and u/s.184 of the Motor Vehicles Act came to be registered at Muktai Nagar police station against driver of S.T.

From this work, he was earning income 4 M.A.C.P. No.308/2015 [Judgment] of Rs.8,000/­ per month. The deceased was only Karta of his family. All the claimants were dependent on his income. After sad demise of deceased Thansing, the claimants have lost his income and they are suffering from financial hardship. At the time of accident, respondent No.1 was driving offending S.T.Bus bearing registration No.MH­40­8952. Respondent No.2 is owner/insurer of said S.T. Bus. The claimants have quantified amount of compensation under different heads to the tune of Rs.31,34,000/­ However, they have restricted the claim to Rs.10,00,000/­ alongwith interest @ 18% p.a. from respondent Nos. 1 and 2 jointly and severally. 5.Respondent No.1 filed his written statement/say at Exh. 17 and denied the contentions of the petition. It is denied that, the driver of motorcycle was driving the motorcycle in moderate slow speed by following traffic rules. It is also denied that, respondent No.1 was rash and negligent while driving the S.T. Bus. It is contended that, the accident occurred due to sole negligence of driver of motorcycle. This respondent further contended that, after necessary training he came to be 5 M.A.C.P. No.308/2015 [Judgment] employed by respondent No.2. He was not negligent at the time of accident. False crime has been registered against him. He denied age and income of deceased at the time of accident.

Age and income of deceased at the time of accident is denied and lastly prayed to dismiss the petition. 6 M.A.C.P. No.308/2015 [Judgment] 7.Having regard to controversies between the parties, issues are framed at Exh. 19. I record my findings thereon for the reasons stated thereafter. ISSUES FINDINGS 1.Whether due to rash and negligent driving of Bus bearing registration No.MH­40­8952 the accident occurred and as a consequence thereof Thansing Trimbak Chavan died ?In the affirmative 2.Whether the claimants are entitled to get compensation ? If yes, what should be the quantum ?In the affirmative, Rs.8,55,000/­ 3.Who is liable to pay the compensation ?Respondent Nos.1&2 jointly & severally 4.What award ? As per final order. REASONS AS TO ISSUE No.1 :­ 8.In order to substantiate claim petition, claimant No.1 Sagunabai wd/o Trimbak Chavan filed her affidavit of evidence at Exh. 23. The claimants have also examined witness by name, Bhagwat Ramdas Bhamre at Exh.32. Apart from this, the claimants have filed on record certified copies of FIR (Exh.24), Spot panchnama (Exh.25), Inquest panchnama (Exh.26), Medical certificate of cause of death (Exh. 27), Postmortem report (Exh.31), Copy of driving license of 7 M.A.C.P. No.308/2015 [Judgment] respondent No.1 (Exh.28), Copy of R.C.Book of S.T.Bus (Exh.29), Form Comp.­AA (Exh.30), Authorization letter in the name of Bhagwat Bhamre (Exh.33), Salary certificate (Exh.34). 9. Claimant No.1 Sagunabai reiterated same facts as per petition in her affidavit of evidence. During her cross­ examination by respondents she denied all adverse suggestions. Nothing could be elicited to falsify the occurrence of accident during her cross­examination. Respondent No.1 has not entered into the witness box to prove his innocence. Concerned police investigated the case and filed charge­sheet against respondent No.1. Registration of offence against respondent No.1 prima facie shows his negligence. Police papers filed on record are not denied by the respondents. Therefore, in absence of any contrary evidence from the side of respondents, it is held that, the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of S.T.Bus bearing registration No. MH­40­8952 by respondent No.1. 10.It reveals from the Inquest panchnama (Exh.26) that, on 20.04.2015 before 17.45 hours Thansing Trimbak 8 M.A.C.P. No.308/2015 [Judgment] Chavan died due to accidental injuries. It reveals from postmortem report (Exh.31) that, Thansing Chavan died on 20.04.2015 due to subdural hemorrhage. Spot panchnama (Exh.25) shows that, S.T. Bus bearing registration No.MH­40­ 8952 is standing as well as motorcycle bearing registration No.MH­19­BW­2678 is seen lying in damaged condition on the spot. The police papers undoubtedly go to show that, the accident occurred on 20.04.2015 and in the said accident on 20.04.2015 Thansing Trimbak Chavan died. Accordingly, issue No. 1 is answered in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NOs. 2 :­ 11.Claimant No.1 is wife of deceased Thansingh Chavan. Claimant No. 2 is son of deceased, whereas, claimant Nos.3 to 5 are his daughters. Claimant No. 6 is father and claimant No.7 is mother of deceased Thansing Chavan. This fact is not denied by respondents. Therefore, the claimants are entitled to get compensation for the accidental death of Thansingh Chavan. 12. On the point of income of the deceased, it is 9 M.A.C.P. No.308/2015 [Judgment] contended in the claim petition as well as affidavit of evidence that, deceased was doing labour work in Arun Oil Industries at Phaoor, Tq. Jamner, Dist. Jalgaon. He was earning Rs.8,000/­ per month from said work. In support of this contention, the claimants have examined their witness by name, Bhagwat Ramdas Bhamre at Exh.32. He deposed that, deceased Thansing was working in Arun Oil Industries from two years prior to the accident. He was getting payment of Rs.8,000/­ per month. 13. During cross­examination, this witness admitted that, he has not brought any document showing that, deceased Thansingh was working in Arun Oil Industries. He also admitted that, accountant of said Industries Mr. Raju Bari told him that, the deceased was getting salary of Rs.8,000/­ per month. He further admitted that, deceased Thansing was doing work on daily wages and was getting salary as per his working days. This witness in cross­examination further deposed that, there is inward­outward register in Arun Oil Industries and every correspondence by and to said Industries is mentioned in 10 M.A.C.P. No.308/2015 [Judgment] inward­outward register. He further admitted that, there is no inward­outward number on the authority letter as well as salary certificate. 14.Considering evidence of this witness, it is proved that, deceased Thansing was working in Arun Oil Industries on daily wages basis and he was getting earning according to the work on daily basis. Therefore, it cannot be held that, deceased Thansing was getting fixed salary of Rs.8,000/­ per month. In these circumstances, considering the period of accident and rates of daily wages prevailant at that time, it would be just and proper to take notional income of deceased as Rs.5,000/­ per month. 15.It is admitted by claimant No. 1 in her cross­ examination that, claimant No. 5 Muktabai is married. She lives at her matrimonial home. Since claimant No.5 is major and married, she cannot be dependent on the income of deceased. Therefore, there are six dependents on the income of the deceased. Hence, 1/4th of the amount of income towards personal expenses of deceased should be deducted. After said 11 M.A.C.P. No.308/2015 [Judgment] deduction, loss of dependency would be Rs.3,750/­. Annual loss of dependency would be Rs.45,000/­(Rs.3,750 x 12). 16.The claimants have contended in their petition age of deceased as 38 years at the time of accident. The claimants have not produced on record any document to show age of the deceased. Postmortem report at Exh.31 shows age of deceased as 45 years. Therefore, considering the age of deceased mentioned on postmortem report, I hold that, at the time of accident, the deceased was 45 years of age. As per ratio laid down in Sarla Verma & ors. vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & Anr., 2009 ACJ 1298, multiplier of 14 will have to be taken. Thus, total amount of compensation comes to Rs.6,30,000/­ (Rs.45,000x14). 17.Apart from this, claimant No.1 is entitled to loss of consortium as Rs.1,00,000/­. Claimants Nos.2 to 7 are entitled to loss of love and affection as Rs.1,00,000/­. The claimants are also entitled for funeral expenses as Rs.25,000/­. In all, claimants are entitled to total amount of compensation as Rs. 8,55,000/­ on all counts. 12 M.A.C.P. No.308/2015 [Judgment] 18.Claimants have claimed interest @ 18% p.a. However, now a days nationalized banks are giving interest at the rate of 7 to 8% on fixed deposits. Therefore, the claimants are entitled to interest at the rate of 8% per annum on the amount of compensation. 19.As per police papers, respondent No.1 is driver, respondent No.2 is owner of offending vehicle. This fact is not denied by the respondents. Therefore, respondent nos. 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the claimants. Hence, I answer issue No. 2 and 3 accordingly as mentioned against it and in answer of issue No.4, pass following order :­ ORDER 1]The Petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs as under :­ 2]Respondent nos. 1 and 2 jointly and severally do pay Rs.8,55,000/­ (Rs. Eight Lakh Fifty­five Thousand only ) alongwith interest @ 8% per annum from the date of the petition till its realization to the claimants. 13 M.A.C.P. No.308/2015 [Judgment] 3]On deposit of amount of compensation in the office of this Tribunal, amount of Rs. 3,55,000/­ be given to claimant No.1. Out of said amount, Rs. 2,00,000/­ be invested in the Fixed Deposit in the name of claimant No.1 in any nationalized bank for the period of three years. She shall be at liberty to withdraw the amount of interest accrued on the fixed deposit amount quarterly, if desired. Remaining amount of Rs. 1,55,000/­ be given to claimant No.1 by account payee cheque in her name on due identification. 4]Out of compensation amount, Rs. 1,25,000/­ each be invested in the Fixed Deposit in the name of claimant Nos. 2, 3 and 4 under guardianship of claimant No.1 in any nationalized bank till they attain their respective ages of majority. Claimant No.1 shall be at liberty to withdraw the amount of interest accrued on the fixed deposit amount quarterly, if desired. 5]Out of compensation amount, Rs. 25,000/­ be given to claimant No. 5 by account 14 M.A.C.P.

[ 2 ] Judgment in M. A. C. P. No.63/2015 Sumitra & Ors. Vs. Shaikh Kadu & Anr office, Aurangabad. Claim:­ Compensation of Rs.7,00,000/­under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act. ================================= Mr A. P. Gunge, Advocate for the Claimants. Mr F. R. Shaikh, Advocate for the Respondents. ================================= JUDGMENT ( Delivered in open Court on 14.03.2016 ) 1)This is fatal accident claim. Petitioners claim compensation of Rs.7,00,000/­ under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act on account of death of Ramesh Trimbak Mule, husband of petitioner No.1, father of petitioner Nos.2 to 4 and son of petitioner No.5 in motor vehicular accident. 2)Briefly stated petitioners' case is that on 13.12.2014 at about 3.15 p.m. deceased Ramesh Trimbak Mule went to Pirbawada bus stand for his work. At that time S.T. Bus bearing No.MH­40­8002 Aurangabad to Rajur driven by its driver in very high speed and in rash and negligent manner and it gave dash to deceased due to which deceased sustained injuries to his both legs, left hand. He was immediately shifted to Rural Hospital, Phulambri where doctor examined and declared dead. Thereafter postmortem was performed on his body. 3)In respect of the accident Police Station, [ 3 ] Judgment in M. A. C. P. No.63/2015 Sumitra & Ors. Vs. Shaikh Kadu & Anr Wadodbazar registered the offence under crime No.I­151/2014 against the driver of the said bus under sections 279, 304­A, 338 of I. P. C. As such the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of said bus bearing No. MH­40­8002 by its driver and he is solely responsible for the accident. Respondent No.1 is the driver of said bus. Respondent No.2 is owner of said bus. At the time of death deceased was 40 years of old. He was doing meson work and earning Rs.500/­ per day. The petitioners were dependent on his income. Hence, petitioners have filed this claim and demanded compensation of Rs.7,00,000/­ from the respondents jointly and severally. 4)Respondent Nos.1 and 2 filed written statement (Exhibit 11) and categorically denied the allegations in respect of the age, occupation of the deceased and the manner in which accident occurred. They denied that said accident took place due to negligence of said bus driver. 5)Following issues were framed at Exhibit 13. I reproduced the issues alongwith my findings thereon for the reasons to follow as under. ISSUES FINDINGS 1)Whether the petitioners prove that the deceased died in the motor vehicular accident dated 13.12.2014 ?:­In the affirmative. [ 4 ] Judgment in M. A. C. P. No.63/2015 Sumitra & Ors. Vs. Shaikh Kadu & Anr 2)Whether petitioners prove that the deceased died in the accident due to rash and negligent driving of S.T. Bus bearing No.MH­40­8002 which is owned by respondent No.2 ?:­In the affirmative. 3)What is just and reasonable amount of compensation and against whom it is to be awarded ?:Rs.7,80,000/­ jointly and severally from respondent Nos.1 and 2. 4)What order and award ? :As per final order. Reasons Issue Nos.1 to 3:­ 6)In order to substantiate the claim the petitioner No.1 Sumitra Mule widow of deceased has examined herself and produced certain documents. Respondent Nos.1 and 2 have not adduced evidence of respondent No.1 who was driver of the said bus at the time of accident. 7)Undisputedly, the accident occurred on 13.12.2014 at 3.15 p.m. on S.T. Bus Stand of village Pirbawada, Tq. Phulambri, District Aurangabad. At the time of accident said bus was proceeding from Aurangabad to Rajur from left side of the road. At the time of recording spot panchnama panch witnesses had seen that at the spot of accident blood was lying. The accident happened on the tar road. At the spot of accident Phulambri to Rajur road passes in east­west direction. To the [ 5 ] Judgment in M. A. C. P. No.63/2015 Sumitra & Ors. Vs. Shaikh Kadu & Anr southern side there is old bus stand of Pirbawada. To the northern side there is tin shed of Shaikh Atik. These circumstances prevailing at the spot of accident duly prove that while driving the said bus along the public road, the respondent no.1 bus driver did not pay proper attention to the traffic on the road and gave dash to the deceased who was pedestrian while driving said bus in rash and negligent manner. Nothing came on record to show that deceased was negligently walking along the road. Copy of inquest panchnama is filed at Exh.17 and postmortem report is filed at Exh.18. Deceased died due to shock due to multiple injuries. 8)In cross­examination of petitioner no.1 it was suggested that at the time of death deceased was more than 50 years of age but she flatly denied that suggestion. In this case petitioners did not produce any document as to age of deceased. In inquest panchnama and postmortem report age of the deceased is shown as 40 years. 9)Petitioner no.1 in her affidavit in lieu of evidence stated that at the time of death deceased was working as meson and was earning Rs.500/­ per day i.e. Rs.15000/­ per month. He was maintaining himself and to them. They were fully dependent upon his income. Except her bare words there is no evidence that deceased was working as meson and earning [ 6 ] Judgment in M. A. C. P. No.63/2015 Sumitra & Ors. Vs. Shaikh Kadu & Anr Rs.500/­ per day. To prove this fact the contractor with whom deceased was working or owner of the house whose construction work is undertaken by him or co­worker of deceased were not examined by the petitioners. Under these circumstances for want of sufficient evidence I hold that notional income of deceased was Rs.3000/­ per month. In case of Smt. Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation reported in AIR 2009 Supreme Court page 3104 Honourable Apex Court held that if the number of dependents in the family of deceased is large, in the absence of specific evidence in regard to contribution to the family, the Court may adopt the unit method for arriving at the contribution of the deceased to his family. Total number of units are to be determined and then the income is divided by number of units. When there are four members in the family of deceased depending on him, the deduction towards personal and living expenses of the deceased would be 1/4th where the number of dependent family members is 4 to 6. The ratio laid down in that case is squarely applicable to the present case. There were five persons in the family of deceased dependent upon his income. Therefore, from the said notional income of deceased 1/4th amount is liable to be deducted towards his personal expenses. That amount comes to Rs.750/­. So at the time of accident deceased was aged 40 years. As such the multiplier to be applied to the age group of 36 years but not exceeding 40 years [ 7 ] Judgment in M. A. C. P. No.63/2015 Sumitra & Ors. Vs. Shaikh Kadu & Anr given in case of Smt. Sarla Verma (cited supra) is 15. 10)Considering the monthly notional income of the deceased at Rs.3,000/­, his yearly income comes to Rs.36,000/­. By deducting 1/4th towards his personal expenses, his loss of dependency and prospective and future loss comes to Rs.4,05,000/­. Petitioners are also entitled to get Rs.25,000/­ towards funeral expenses. Petitioner No.1 is also entitled to get Rs.1,00,000/­ towards amount of consortium. Petitioners are also entitled to get Rs.50,000/­each total Rs.2,50,000/­ towards love and affection. Thus, total amount of compensation comes to Rs.4,05,000/­+ Rs.2,50,000/­+ Rs.25,000/­ + Rs.1,00,000/­ = Rs.7,80,000/­. The petitioners have restricted their claim to Rs.7,00,000/­. Hence, they are entitled to get Rs.7,80,000/­ towards compensation which is inclusive of amount of compensation awarded under section 140 of M. V. Act. Petitioner No.1 is wife of deceased Ramesh, petitioner Nos.2 to 4 are children of deceased and petitioner No.5 is mother of the deceased. Above said amount of compensation required to be distributed amongst them. 11)Respondent No.2 is owner of the offending vehicle i.e. bus. So, the respondent Nos.1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the petitioners. The above issues are answered accordingly as indicated against each [ 8 ] Judgment in M. A. C. P. No.63/2015 Sumitra & Ors. Vs. Shaikh Kadu & Anr of them in terms of above observations. In the result, I pass following order. ORDER 1.Petition is allowed with costs. 2.Respondent Nos.1 and 2 jointly and severally do pay the amount of Rs.7,80,000/­ (Rupees Seven Lacs Eighty Thousand only) to the petitioners inclusive of compensation under section 140 of M. V. Act with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of petition till realisation of the entire amount. 3.On deposit of the amount of compensation in the Tribunal, the amount of Rs.2,56,000/­ (Rupees Two Lacs Fifty Six Thousand only) be given to the share of petitioner No.1. Out of that amount Rs.1,50,000/­ be paid to her by issuing account payee cheque of any National Bank in her name and the amount of Rs.1,06,000/­ (Rupees One Lac Six Thousand only) be kept in fixed deposit in her name in any Nationalised Bank for the period of three years. 4.Rs.1,31,000/­ each be invested in fixed deposit account of any Nationalized Bank in the names of minor petitioner Nos.2 to 4 till they attain the age of majority. 5.Out of remaining amount of Rs.1,31,000/­ Rs.60,000/­ be [ 9 ] Judgment in M. A. C. P. No.63/2015 Sumitra & Ors. Vs. Shaikh Kadu & Anr paid to petitioner No.5 by issuing an account payee cheque in her name and remaining amount of Rs.71,000/­ be invested in her name in fixed deposit scheme of any Nationalized Bank for the period of five years 6.Award be prepared accordingly on depositing deficit court fee.

( 2 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) J U D G M E N T ( Delivered on 31th December, 2015 ) This petition is for grant of compensation U/sec.166 of The Motor Vehicles Act,1988 on account of unfortunate death of Ganesh s/o.Govind Wagh R/o. Talni, Tq. Sillod, District ­ Aurangabad, in a road accident. 2. The claimants are the legal representatives of deceased Ganesh Wagh, who lost his life on 25.02.2015 because of injuries caused to him in a motor vehicular accident. Claimant No.1 is the father, claimant no.2 is the mother and claimant No.3 is the real younger sister of deceased, Ganesh Wagh. 3. It is the case of claimants that, on 25.02.2015, at about 19­ 00 hours, deceased Ganesh was proceeding on his motorcycle. While on his way near Kerhala Phata on Sillod­Aurangabad Road, one ST Bus bearing Registration No.MH20 BL 2390 came from opposite direction in a very rash and negligent manner and gave forceful dash to the motorcycle of the deceased. In the accident so happened, deceased Ganesh was severely injured. He was immediately taken to Rural Hospital, Sillod. After examination, he was declared dead by the medical officer. On the next day of incident, father of the deceased lodged report with Police Station, Vadod Bazar. On the basis of report, offence vide Crime No.20/2015 was registered against the driver of ST Bus i.e. respondent no.2 for the offences punishable under Sections 279, ( 3 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) 304­A of IPC. 4.As stated in the petition, at the time of accident, age of the deceased was 24 years and he was student of MBBS Final Year in Government Medical College, Aurangabad. The claimants have contended that, the deceased was brilliant and extra­ordinary student. After his graduation, he could have pursued his post graduation and reached greater heights. The claimants had provided best facilities to the deceased. The accident in question happened because of the rash and negligent driving of ST Bus by its driver i.e. respondent no.2. Thus, the claimants have quantified the total compensation to the tune of Rs.81,35,000/­ including the compensation under other conventional heads i.e. loss of love and affection, funeral charges etc. against respondent no.1 MSRTC, and respondent no.2 driver of the vehicle jointly and severally. 5.Respondent No.1 filed its written statement at Exh­11 and respondent no.2 filed his written statement at Exh­12 and thereby they both denied the claim made by the claimants. Respondents denied the age, occupation and income of deceased, Ganesh Wagh and the mode and manner in which the accident occurred. The respondents further contended that, the accident occurred only due to the fault of the deceased and there is no fault on the part of driver of ST Bus. By making such averments, respondents submitted for rejection of the claim petition. ( 4 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) 6. On the pleading of the parties, my Ld. Predecessor framed the Issues at Exh.13. They are reproduced herein below and I have recorded my findings against each of them, for the reasons stated below. ISSUES FINDINGS. 1)Whether the applicants prove that death of deceased Ganesh s/o. Govind Wagh caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle S.T.Bus bearing registration No.MH–20­BL­2390 ? ...... Yes. 2)Whether the applicants are entitled to get compensation? If yes, to what extent and from whom ?......Yes, Rs.54,80,000/­ inclusive of N.F.L. amount. 3)What order? .... As per final order. REASONS 7. In order to substantiate the contentions raised in the petition, claimant No.1 Govind Shivram Wagh deposed before this Court by filing affidavit of his evidence at Exh.19 and examined Mr.Umeshkumar Bhagwanrao Shahane as CW­2 at Exh­31 to prove the income of the deceased. The claimants have placed on record certified copies of relevant police papers pertaining to accident in question. They are; FIR (Exhs.20), Inquest Panchanama (Exh­21), Postmortem Examination Report (Exh­22), Spot Panchanama (Exh­23) and Form 'AA' (Exh­24). The claimants have also produced statement of marks obtained by the deceased in XII Standard at Exh­25, MBBS I Year at ( 5 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) Exh­26, MBBS II Year at Exh­27 and MBBS III Year at Exh­28. The claimants have filed purshis at Exh­34 and thereby closed their side. 8.Respondents no.1 and 2 did not adduce evidence in rebuttal and closed their side by filing purshis at Exh­35. I have heard Shri A.G.Ansari, Ld.Advocate appearing on behalf of the claimants and Shri F.R.Shaikh, Ld.Advocate appearing for the respondents. AS TO ISSUE NO. 1:­ 9.It is submitted by the Ld.Advocate for claimants that, police papers pertaining to accident in question clearly indicate that, respondent no.2 was driving the S.T.Bus in rash and negligent manner and gave dash to the deceased. On the other hand, Ld. Advocate for respondents submitted that, no evidence adduced by the claimants to reach to the conclusion that, the S.T.Bus was being driven in a rash and negligent manner. In absence of such evidence, claimants are not entitled to get compensation. 10. Having considered the submissions made on behalf of both the sides, I have gone through the evidence available on record. First of all, I would like to mention here that, the factum of death of deceased Ganesh in the accident involving the ST Bus bearing registration No.MH­20­BL­2390 near Kerhala Phata is not disputed by the respondents. It is not in dispute that, on the fateful day, respondent no.2 was driving the ST Bus in question and at that time, he was employee ( 6 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) of Respondent No.1. On the background of these uncontroverted facts, it will have to be seen whether Respondent No.2 was rash and negligent while driving ST Bus on the day of accident. 11. CW­1 Govind Wagh deposes that, on 25.2.2015 at about 19­00 hours, accident took place on Sillod­Aurangabad Road near Kerhala Phata and in the said accident, ST Bus driven by respondent no.2 came from opposite direction gave dash to the motorcycle of the deceased. The deceased sustained injuries and died due to head injury and multiple injuries caused in the said accident. On the point of rash and negligent driving of ST Bus, except suggestions put to this witness, nothing is elicited from this witness. FIR Exh­20 discloses that, the matter was reported to the police by CW­1 and on the basis of it, an offence vide Crime No.20/2015 came to be registered with Vadod Bazar Police Station for the offences punishable u/S.279, 304­A of IPC against respondent no.2. Spot Panchanama Exh­23 would show that, motorcycle of the deceased had head­on collision with the ST Bus because middle portion of front side of of ST Bus got damaged. 12.It is pertinent to note that, respondent no.2 did not appear in the witness box to adduce evidence in rebuttal to show that, he had taken all the precautions and care to avoid the accident and it is the deceased who was responsible for his death. In absence of evidence in rebuttal, there is no reason to disbelieve the evidence of CW­1 coupled with documentary evidence i.e. FIR Exh­20 and Spot Panchanama Exh­ ( 7 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) 23. On the basis of such evidence, it can be inferred that, the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the ST Bus by respondent no.2 and he is 100% negligent in driving S.T.Bus. Inquest Panchanama Exh­21 would show that, deceased Ganesh sustained severe injuries and the Postmortem Examination Report discloses that, the cause of death of the deceased is cardio respiratory arrest due to head injury and multiple injuries in road accident. The claimants have thus placed on record prima facie evidence to show negligence on the part of respondent no.2 and that the death of deceased Ganesh was occurred in a motor vehicular accident. Hence, I answer point no.1 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO.2: ­ 13. In view of my affirmative finding on Issue No.1 in respect of the fact that, deceased Ganesh Wagh died on 25.02.2015 due to rash and negligent driving of ST Bus bearing registration No. MH­20­BL­ 2390 by its driver i.e. Respondent No.2, claimant No.1 to 3 being legal representatives of the deceased, they are certainly entitled for compensation under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act. The claimants came with a case that, they are dependent upon the income of the deceased. Claimant no.2 is the mother of the deceased and claimant no.3 is the minor sister and claimant no.1 is father of the deceased. He has no source of income. In absence of contrary evidence, along with mother, father of the deceased will be considered as dependent and, therefore, all the three claimants are certainly entitled for the ( 8 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) compensation on account of death of Ganesh Wagh. 14. Now coming to the aspect of compensation to be awarded to the claimants in the facts and circumstances of the case. It has come on record that, the deceased was the only son of claimants no.1 and 2. He was selected on merit basis and was pursuing his MBBS Degree in a prestigious institute like, Government Medical College, Aurangabad. At the time of accident, he was a student of MBBS Final Year and considering his calibre, amount of compensation to be awarded. The claimants have placed on record statements of marks obtained by the deceased in the examination of MBBS I, II and III Year. The evidence of CW­1 was not challenged on this point by the respondents. 15.In order to ascertain the income of the deceased, the claimants have examined CW­2 Mr.Umeshkumar Bhagwanrao Shahane at Exh­31 who is classmate of the deceased in MBBS Course. According to this witness, after completion of MBBS course, he joined service as medical officer at ESIS Hospital, Aurangabad and getting monthly salary of Rs.56,540/­. He placed on record copy of his appointment letter Exh­32 and copy of pay slip at Exh­33. Ld.Advocate for the claimants submitted that, considering the evidence of CW­2, it may be held that, at least the deceased would have earned monthly income of Rs.56,000/­. Considering this income, compensation be awarded. ( 9 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) 16.The documentary evidence placed on record would show that, deceased Ganesh Wagh was pursuing his MBBS degree and he was a student of MBBS Final Year in Government Medical College & Hospital, Aurangabad. No doubt, Mr.Umeshkumar (CW­2) is getting salary of Rs.56,540/­ per month. However, it can not be said that, the deceased would have got Government service and he would have earned that much amount. After completion of degree, he could have pursued his post­graduation or could have joined service but judicial note can be taken that, there is tremendous increase in demand for medical professionals and a person who has completed MBBS course will definitely earn not less than Rs.1,000/­ to Rs.1,200/­ per day if he starts his dispensary even in rural area. Taking into consideration this reality and the salary and allowances payable to a newly appointed medical officer in a Government service, it is fair and reasonable to assess future earning of the deceased at Rs.35,000/­ per month and in future he would earn more amount. Considering this aspect, future prospects are to be considered. 17. In a case of Rajesh and others Vs. Rajbir Singh and others, reported in 2013 (3) T.A.C. 697 (S.C.) , the Hon'ble Supreme Court clarified that in the case of self­employed or persons with fixed wages, in case, the deceased victim was below 40 years, there must be an addition of 50% to the actual income of the deceased while computing future prospects. We have to take into consideration the monthly income of the deceased at Rs.35,000/­ which comes to ( 10 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) Rs.4,20,000/­ per annum. The deceased was below 40 years of age. Therefore, I am inclined to give 50% increase in the annual income of Rs.4,20,000/­ which comes to Rs.2,10,000/­. Thus, yearly income of deceased for the purpose of calculation comes to Rs.6,30,000/­. (Rs.4,20,000/­ + Rs.2,10,000/­ = Rs.6,30,000/­). 18.In view of the guiding principle given in the case of Sarla Varma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another, reported in 2009 A.C.J. ­ 1298 where the deceased was a bachelor and the claimants are parents, normally 50% is deducted as personal and living expenses. Here in this case, undisputedly, the deceased was bachelor. Therefore, 50% amount is to be deducted from his annual income which comes to Rs.3,15,000/­. The remaining amount will be considered as annual contribution to the family by the deceased. Annual contribution to the family when multiplied by multiplier, gives loss of dependency to the family. The claimants have come with a case that, the age of the deceased was 24 years. However, they have not placed on record any documentary proof. In absence of documentary proof, we will have to consider the age mentioned in the Inquest Panchanama and Postmortem Examination Report. As per these two documents, the age of the deceased was 27 years. Therefore, as per the table finalised by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sarla Varma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another, reported in 2009 A.C.J. ­ 1298, the relevant multiplier for the age in between 26 to 30 comes to '17'. So, amount of Rs.3,15,000/­ X 17 which comes to net ( 11 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) compensation of Rs.53,55,000/­ as loss of dependency. 19. Claimants no.1 and 2 are the parents of the deceased. They had the only son who was taking education in Government Medical College, Aurangabad and it was a dream of the parents to see their son while practising in medical profession. They have been deprived of their dream and future prospects and love and affection of their deceased son. Death of the only son who is having a bright future is definitely shocking to the parents. Therefore, I am inclined to grant Rs.1 lakh towards love and affection and also conventional expenses of Rs.25,000/­ towards funeral expenses. 20.In view of my aforesaid discussion, I reached to the conclusion that, claimants no.1 to 3 are entitled to get total compensation of Rs.54,80,000/­ inclusive of the amount under no fault liability from the respondents which is just, fair and reasonable. Undisputedly, respondent No.2 was driver of ST Bus bearing registration No.MH­20­BL­2390 and at the time of accident, he was employee of respondent no.1. Thus, respondent No.1 i.e. MSRTC is vicariously liable for negligent act of its driver i.e. respondent No.2. In such circumstances, both the respondents are liable to pay compensation to the claimants for the death of deceased Ganesh Wagh in the road accident. So far as rate of interest is concerned, considering the amount of compensation, an interest @ 6% per annum from the date of petition till realization of the compensation amount would meet the ( 12 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) ends of justice. Hence, I answer Issue No. 2 accordingly and pass the following order. ORDER 1)The petition is allowed, as under. 2)Claimant No. 1 to 3 are entitled to get total compensation of Rs.54,80,000/­ inclusive of the amount of 'No Fault Liability'. 3) Respondent No. 1 and 2 do pay an amount of Rs.54,30,000/­ (excluding NFL amount) towards compensation jointly or severally, to the claimants with interest @6% per annum from the date of institution of claim petition i.e. from 02.04.b2015 till realisation of entire amount. 4)The amount of compensation of Rs.54,30,000/­ be apportioned amongst the claimants as under: 1) Claimant No.1 : Rs24,00,000/­ + Interest + (Father) proportionate cost of the petition. 2) Claimant No. 2 : Rs.24,00,000/­ + Interest + (Mother) proportionate cost of the petition. 3) Claimant No. 3 : Rs.6,30,000/­+ Interest + (Sister) proportionate cost of the petition. 5)Out of the amount of compensation of Rs.24,00,000/­ payable to Claimant No.1, an amount of Rs.20,00,000/­ be invested in fixed deposit in his name in any Nationalized Bank, as per his choice for a period of five years with a liberty to withdraw the interest amount accrued on the fixed deposit amount quarterly if he desired and the remaining amount of Rs.4,00,000/­ alongwith interest be paid to him in person by issuing an account payee cheque.

( 2 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) J U D G M E N T ( Delivered on 31th December, 2015 ) This petition is for grant of compensation U/sec.166 of The Motor Vehicles Act,1988 on account of unfortunate death of Ganesh s/o.Govind Wagh R/o. Talni, Tq. Sillod, District ­ Aurangabad, in a road accident. 2. The claimants are the legal representatives of deceased Ganesh Wagh, who lost his life on 25.02.2015 because of injuries caused to him in a motor vehicular accident. Claimant No.1 is the father, claimant no.2 is the mother and claimant No.3 is the real younger sister of deceased, Ganesh Wagh. 3. It is the case of claimants that, on 25.02.2015, at about 19­ 00 hours, deceased Ganesh was proceeding on his motorcycle. While on his way near Kerhala Phata on Sillod­Aurangabad Road, one ST Bus bearing Registration No.MH20 BL 2390 came from opposite direction in a very rash and negligent manner and gave forceful dash to the motorcycle of the deceased. In the accident so happened, deceased Ganesh was severely injured. He was immediately taken to Rural Hospital, Sillod. After examination, he was declared dead by the medical officer. On the next day of incident, father of the deceased lodged report with Police Station, Vadod Bazar. On the basis of report, offence vide Crime No.20/2015 was registered against the driver of ST Bus i.e. respondent no.2 for the offences punishable under Sections 279, ( 3 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) 304­A of IPC. 4.As stated in the petition, at the time of accident, age of the deceased was 24 years and he was student of MBBS Final Year in Government Medical College, Aurangabad. The claimants have contended that, the deceased was brilliant and extra­ordinary student. After his graduation, he could have pursued his post graduation and reached greater heights. The claimants had provided best facilities to the deceased. The accident in question happened because of the rash and negligent driving of ST Bus by its driver i.e. respondent no.2. Thus, the claimants have quantified the total compensation to the tune of Rs.81,35,000/­ including the compensation under other conventional heads i.e. loss of love and affection, funeral charges etc. against respondent no.1 MSRTC, and respondent no.2 driver of the vehicle jointly and severally. 5.Respondent No.1 filed its written statement at Exh­11 and respondent no.2 filed his written statement at Exh­12 and thereby they both denied the claim made by the claimants. Respondents denied the age, occupation and income of deceased, Ganesh Wagh and the mode and manner in which the accident occurred. The respondents further contended that, the accident occurred only due to the fault of the deceased and there is no fault on the part of driver of ST Bus. By making such averments, respondents submitted for rejection of the claim petition. ( 4 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) 6. On the pleading of the parties, my Ld. Predecessor framed the Issues at Exh.13. They are reproduced herein below and I have recorded my findings against each of them, for the reasons stated below. ISSUES FINDINGS. 1)Whether the applicants prove that death of deceased Ganesh s/o. Govind Wagh caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle S.T.Bus bearing registration No.MH–20­BL­2390 ? ...... Yes. 2)Whether the applicants are entitled to get compensation? If yes, to what extent and from whom ?......Yes, Rs.54,80,000/­ inclusive of N.F.L. amount. 3)What order? .... As per final order. REASONS 7. In order to substantiate the contentions raised in the petition, claimant No.1 Govind Shivram Wagh deposed before this Court by filing affidavit of his evidence at Exh.19 and examined Mr.Umeshkumar Bhagwanrao Shahane as CW­2 at Exh­31 to prove the income of the deceased. The claimants have placed on record certified copies of relevant police papers pertaining to accident in question. They are; FIR (Exhs.20), Inquest Panchanama (Exh­21), Postmortem Examination Report (Exh­22), Spot Panchanama (Exh­23) and Form 'AA' (Exh­24). The claimants have also produced statement of marks obtained by the deceased in XII Standard at Exh­25, MBBS I Year at ( 5 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) Exh­26, MBBS II Year at Exh­27 and MBBS III Year at Exh­28. The claimants have filed purshis at Exh­34 and thereby closed their side. 8.Respondents no.1 and 2 did not adduce evidence in rebuttal and closed their side by filing purshis at Exh­35. I have heard Shri A.G.Ansari, Ld.Advocate appearing on behalf of the claimants and Shri F.R.Shaikh, Ld.Advocate appearing for the respondents. AS TO ISSUE NO. 1:­ 9.It is submitted by the Ld.Advocate for claimants that, police papers pertaining to accident in question clearly indicate that, respondent no.2 was driving the S.T.Bus in rash and negligent manner and gave dash to the deceased. On the other hand, Ld. Advocate for respondents submitted that, no evidence adduced by the claimants to reach to the conclusion that, the S.T.Bus was being driven in a rash and negligent manner. In absence of such evidence, claimants are not entitled to get compensation. 10. Having considered the submissions made on behalf of both the sides, I have gone through the evidence available on record. First of all, I would like to mention here that, the factum of death of deceased Ganesh in the accident involving the ST Bus bearing registration No.MH­20­BL­2390 near Kerhala Phata is not disputed by the respondents. It is not in dispute that, on the fateful day, respondent no.2 was driving the ST Bus in question and at that time, he was employee ( 6 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) of Respondent No.1. On the background of these uncontroverted facts, it will have to be seen whether Respondent No.2 was rash and negligent while driving ST Bus on the day of accident. 11. CW­1 Govind Wagh deposes that, on 25.2.2015 at about 19­00 hours, accident took place on Sillod­Aurangabad Road near Kerhala Phata and in the said accident, ST Bus driven by respondent no.2 came from opposite direction gave dash to the motorcycle of the deceased. The deceased sustained injuries and died due to head injury and multiple injuries caused in the said accident. On the point of rash and negligent driving of ST Bus, except suggestions put to this witness, nothing is elicited from this witness. FIR Exh­20 discloses that, the matter was reported to the police by CW­1 and on the basis of it, an offence vide Crime No.20/2015 came to be registered with Vadod Bazar Police Station for the offences punishable u/S.279, 304­A of IPC against respondent no.2. Spot Panchanama Exh­23 would show that, motorcycle of the deceased had head­on collision with the ST Bus because middle portion of front side of of ST Bus got damaged. 12.It is pertinent to note that, respondent no.2 did not appear in the witness box to adduce evidence in rebuttal to show that, he had taken all the precautions and care to avoid the accident and it is the deceased who was responsible for his death. In absence of evidence in rebuttal, there is no reason to disbelieve the evidence of CW­1 coupled with documentary evidence i.e. FIR Exh­20 and Spot Panchanama Exh­ ( 7 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) 23. On the basis of such evidence, it can be inferred that, the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the ST Bus by respondent no.2 and he is 100% negligent in driving S.T.Bus. Inquest Panchanama Exh­21 would show that, deceased Ganesh sustained severe injuries and the Postmortem Examination Report discloses that, the cause of death of the deceased is cardio respiratory arrest due to head injury and multiple injuries in road accident. The claimants have thus placed on record prima facie evidence to show negligence on the part of respondent no.2 and that the death of deceased Ganesh was occurred in a motor vehicular accident. Hence, I answer point no.1 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO.2: ­ 13. In view of my affirmative finding on Issue No.1 in respect of the fact that, deceased Ganesh Wagh died on 25.02.2015 due to rash and negligent driving of ST Bus bearing registration No. MH­20­BL­ 2390 by its driver i.e. Respondent No.2, claimant No.1 to 3 being legal representatives of the deceased, they are certainly entitled for compensation under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act. The claimants came with a case that, they are dependent upon the income of the deceased. Claimant no.2 is the mother of the deceased and claimant no.3 is the minor sister and claimant no.1 is father of the deceased. He has no source of income. In absence of contrary evidence, along with mother, father of the deceased will be considered as dependent and, therefore, all the three claimants are certainly entitled for the ( 8 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) compensation on account of death of Ganesh Wagh. 14. Now coming to the aspect of compensation to be awarded to the claimants in the facts and circumstances of the case. It has come on record that, the deceased was the only son of claimants no.1 and 2. He was selected on merit basis and was pursuing his MBBS Degree in a prestigious institute like, Government Medical College, Aurangabad. At the time of accident, he was a student of MBBS Final Year and considering his calibre, amount of compensation to be awarded. The claimants have placed on record statements of marks obtained by the deceased in the examination of MBBS I, II and III Year. The evidence of CW­1 was not challenged on this point by the respondents. 15.In order to ascertain the income of the deceased, the claimants have examined CW­2 Mr.Umeshkumar Bhagwanrao Shahane at Exh­31 who is classmate of the deceased in MBBS Course. According to this witness, after completion of MBBS course, he joined service as medical officer at ESIS Hospital, Aurangabad and getting monthly salary of Rs.56,540/­. He placed on record copy of his appointment letter Exh­32 and copy of pay slip at Exh­33. Ld.Advocate for the claimants submitted that, considering the evidence of CW­2, it may be held that, at least the deceased would have earned monthly income of Rs.56,000/­. Considering this income, compensation be awarded. ( 9 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) 16.The documentary evidence placed on record would show that, deceased Ganesh Wagh was pursuing his MBBS degree and he was a student of MBBS Final Year in Government Medical College & Hospital, Aurangabad. No doubt, Mr.Umeshkumar (CW­2) is getting salary of Rs.56,540/­ per month. However, it can not be said that, the deceased would have got Government service and he would have earned that much amount. After completion of degree, he could have pursued his post­graduation or could have joined service but judicial note can be taken that, there is tremendous increase in demand for medical professionals and a person who has completed MBBS course will definitely earn not less than Rs.1,000/­ to Rs.1,200/­ per day if he starts his dispensary even in rural area. Taking into consideration this reality and the salary and allowances payable to a newly appointed medical officer in a Government service, it is fair and reasonable to assess future earning of the deceased at Rs.35,000/­ per month and in future he would earn more amount. Considering this aspect, future prospects are to be considered. 17. In a case of Rajesh and others Vs. Rajbir Singh and others, reported in 2013 (3) T.A.C. 697 (S.C.) , the Hon'ble Supreme Court clarified that in the case of self­employed or persons with fixed wages, in case, the deceased victim was below 40 years, there must be an addition of 50% to the actual income of the deceased while computing future prospects. We have to take into consideration the monthly income of the deceased at Rs.35,000/­ which comes to ( 10 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) Rs.4,20,000/­ per annum. The deceased was below 40 years of age. Therefore, I am inclined to give 50% increase in the annual income of Rs.4,20,000/­ which comes to Rs.2,10,000/­. Thus, yearly income of deceased for the purpose of calculation comes to Rs.6,30,000/­. (Rs.4,20,000/­ + Rs.2,10,000/­ = Rs.6,30,000/­). 18.In view of the guiding principle given in the case of Sarla Varma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another, reported in 2009 A.C.J. ­ 1298 where the deceased was a bachelor and the claimants are parents, normally 50% is deducted as personal and living expenses. Here in this case, undisputedly, the deceased was bachelor. Therefore, 50% amount is to be deducted from his annual income which comes to Rs.3,15,000/­. The remaining amount will be considered as annual contribution to the family by the deceased. Annual contribution to the family when multiplied by multiplier, gives loss of dependency to the family. The claimants have come with a case that, the age of the deceased was 24 years. However, they have not placed on record any documentary proof. In absence of documentary proof, we will have to consider the age mentioned in the Inquest Panchanama and Postmortem Examination Report. As per these two documents, the age of the deceased was 27 years. Therefore, as per the table finalised by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sarla Varma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another, reported in 2009 A.C.J. ­ 1298, the relevant multiplier for the age in between 26 to 30 comes to '17'. So, amount of Rs.3,15,000/­ X 17 which comes to net ( 11 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) compensation of Rs.53,55,000/­ as loss of dependency. 19. Claimants no.1 and 2 are the parents of the deceased. They had the only son who was taking education in Government Medical College, Aurangabad and it was a dream of the parents to see their son while practising in medical profession. They have been deprived of their dream and future prospects and love and affection of their deceased son. Death of the only son who is having a bright future is definitely shocking to the parents. Therefore, I am inclined to grant Rs.1 lakh towards love and affection and also conventional expenses of Rs.25,000/­ towards funeral expenses. 20.In view of my aforesaid discussion, I reached to the conclusion that, claimants no.1 to 3 are entitled to get total compensation of Rs.54,80,000/­ inclusive of the amount under no fault liability from the respondents which is just, fair and reasonable. Undisputedly, respondent No.2 was driver of ST Bus bearing registration No.MH­20­BL­2390 and at the time of accident, he was employee of respondent no.1. Thus, respondent No.1 i.e. MSRTC is vicariously liable for negligent act of its driver i.e. respondent No.2. In such circumstances, both the respondents are liable to pay compensation to the claimants for the death of deceased Ganesh Wagh in the road accident. So far as rate of interest is concerned, considering the amount of compensation, an interest @ 6% per annum from the date of petition till realization of the compensation amount would meet the ( 12 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) ends of justice.

ORDER 1)The petition is allowed, as under. 2)Claimant No. 1 to 3 are entitled to get total compensation of Rs.54,80,000/­ inclusive of the amount of 'No Fault Liability'. 3) Respondent No. 1 and 2 do pay an amount of Rs.54,30,000/­ (excluding NFL amount) towards compensation jointly or severally, to the claimants with interest @6% per annum from the date of institution of claim petition i.e. from 02.04.b2015 till realisation of entire amount. 4)The amount of compensation of Rs.54,30,000/­ be apportioned amongst the claimants as under: 1) Claimant No.1 : Rs24,00,000/­ + Interest + (Father) proportionate cost of the petition. 2) Claimant No. 2 : Rs.24,00,000/­ + Interest + (Mother) proportionate cost of the petition. 3) Claimant No. 3 : Rs.6,30,000/­+ Interest + (Sister) proportionate cost of the petition. 5)Out of the amount of compensation of Rs.24,00,000/­ payable to Claimant No.1, an amount of Rs.20,00,000/­ be invested in fixed deposit in his name in any Nationalized Bank, as per his choice for a period of five years with a liberty to withdraw the interest amount accrued on the fixed deposit amount quarterly if he desired and the remaining amount of Rs.4,00,000/­ alongwith interest be paid to him in person by issuing an account payee cheque.

( 2 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) J U D G M E N T ( Delivered on 31th December, 2015 ) This petition is for grant of compensation U/sec.166 of The Motor Vehicles Act,1988 on account of unfortunate death of Ganesh s/o.Govind Wagh R/o. Talni, Tq. Sillod, District ­ Aurangabad, in a road accident. 2. The claimants are the legal representatives of deceased Ganesh Wagh, who lost his life on 25.02.2015 because of injuries caused to him in a motor vehicular accident. Claimant No.1 is the father, claimant no.2 is the mother and claimant No.3 is the real younger sister of deceased, Ganesh Wagh. 3. It is the case of claimants that, on 25.02.2015, at about 19­ 00 hours, deceased Ganesh was proceeding on his motorcycle. While on his way near Kerhala Phata on Sillod­Aurangabad Road, one ST Bus bearing Registration No.MH20 BL 2390 came from opposite direction in a very rash and negligent manner and gave forceful dash to the motorcycle of the deceased. In the accident so happened, deceased Ganesh was severely injured. He was immediately taken to Rural Hospital, Sillod. After examination, he was declared dead by the medical officer. On the next day of incident, father of the deceased lodged report with Police Station, Vadod Bazar. On the basis of report, offence vide Crime No.20/2015 was registered against the driver of ST Bus i.e. respondent no.2 for the offences punishable under Sections 279, ( 3 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) 304­A of IPC. 4.As stated in the petition, at the time of accident, age of the deceased was 24 years and he was student of MBBS Final Year in Government Medical College, Aurangabad. The claimants have contended that, the deceased was brilliant and extra­ordinary student. After his graduation, he could have pursued his post graduation and reached greater heights. The claimants had provided best facilities to the deceased. The accident in question happened because of the rash and negligent driving of ST Bus by its driver i.e. respondent no.2. Thus, the claimants have quantified the total compensation to the tune of Rs.81,35,000/­ including the compensation under other conventional heads i.e. loss of love and affection, funeral charges etc. against respondent no.1 MSRTC, and respondent no.2 driver of the vehicle jointly and severally. 5.Respondent No.1 filed its written statement at Exh­11 and respondent no.2 filed his written statement at Exh­12 and thereby they both denied the claim made by the claimants. Respondents denied the age, occupation and income of deceased, Ganesh Wagh and the mode and manner in which the accident occurred. The respondents further contended that, the accident occurred only due to the fault of the deceased and there is no fault on the part of driver of ST Bus. By making such averments, respondents submitted for rejection of the claim petition. ( 4 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) 6. On the pleading of the parties, my Ld. Predecessor framed the Issues at Exh.13. They are reproduced herein below and I have recorded my findings against each of them, for the reasons stated below. ISSUES FINDINGS. 1)Whether the applicants prove that death of deceased Ganesh s/o. Govind Wagh caused due to rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle S.T.Bus bearing registration No.MH–20­BL­2390 ? ...... Yes. 2)Whether the applicants are entitled to get compensation? If yes, to what extent and from whom ?......Yes, Rs.54,80,000/­ inclusive of N.F.L. amount. 3)What order? .... As per final order. REASONS 7. In order to substantiate the contentions raised in the petition, claimant No.1 Govind Shivram Wagh deposed before this Court by filing affidavit of his evidence at Exh.19 and examined Mr.Umeshkumar Bhagwanrao Shahane as CW­2 at Exh­31 to prove the income of the deceased. The claimants have placed on record certified copies of relevant police papers pertaining to accident in question. They are; FIR (Exhs.20), Inquest Panchanama (Exh­21), Postmortem Examination Report (Exh­22), Spot Panchanama (Exh­23) and Form 'AA' (Exh­24). The claimants have also produced statement of marks obtained by the deceased in XII Standard at Exh­25, MBBS I Year at ( 5 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) Exh­26, MBBS II Year at Exh­27 and MBBS III Year at Exh­28. The claimants have filed purshis at Exh­34 and thereby closed their side. 8.Respondents no.1 and 2 did not adduce evidence in rebuttal and closed their side by filing purshis at Exh­35. I have heard Shri A.G.Ansari, Ld.Advocate appearing on behalf of the claimants and Shri F.R.Shaikh, Ld.Advocate appearing for the respondents. AS TO ISSUE NO. 1:­ 9.It is submitted by the Ld.Advocate for claimants that, police papers pertaining to accident in question clearly indicate that, respondent no.2 was driving the S.T.Bus in rash and negligent manner and gave dash to the deceased. On the other hand, Ld. Advocate for respondents submitted that, no evidence adduced by the claimants to reach to the conclusion that, the S.T.Bus was being driven in a rash and negligent manner. In absence of such evidence, claimants are not entitled to get compensation. 10. Having considered the submissions made on behalf of both the sides, I have gone through the evidence available on record. First of all, I would like to mention here that, the factum of death of deceased Ganesh in the accident involving the ST Bus bearing registration No.MH­20­BL­2390 near Kerhala Phata is not disputed by the respondents. It is not in dispute that, on the fateful day, respondent no.2 was driving the ST Bus in question and at that time, he was employee ( 6 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) of Respondent No.1. On the background of these uncontroverted facts, it will have to be seen whether Respondent No.2 was rash and negligent while driving ST Bus on the day of accident. 11. CW­1 Govind Wagh deposes that, on 25.2.2015 at about 19­00 hours, accident took place on Sillod­Aurangabad Road near Kerhala Phata and in the said accident, ST Bus driven by respondent no.2 came from opposite direction gave dash to the motorcycle of the deceased. The deceased sustained injuries and died due to head injury and multiple injuries caused in the said accident. On the point of rash and negligent driving of ST Bus, except suggestions put to this witness, nothing is elicited from this witness. FIR Exh­20 discloses that, the matter was reported to the police by CW­1 and on the basis of it, an offence vide Crime No.20/2015 came to be registered with Vadod Bazar Police Station for the offences punishable u/S.279, 304­A of IPC against respondent no.2. Spot Panchanama Exh­23 would show that, motorcycle of the deceased had head­on collision with the ST Bus because middle portion of front side of of ST Bus got damaged. 12.It is pertinent to note that, respondent no.2 did not appear in the witness box to adduce evidence in rebuttal to show that, he had taken all the precautions and care to avoid the accident and it is the deceased who was responsible for his death. In absence of evidence in rebuttal, there is no reason to disbelieve the evidence of CW­1 coupled with documentary evidence i.e. FIR Exh­20 and Spot Panchanama Exh­ ( 7 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) 23. On the basis of such evidence, it can be inferred that, the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the ST Bus by respondent no.2 and he is 100% negligent in driving S.T.Bus. Inquest Panchanama Exh­21 would show that, deceased Ganesh sustained severe injuries and the Postmortem Examination Report discloses that, the cause of death of the deceased is cardio respiratory arrest due to head injury and multiple injuries in road accident. The claimants have thus placed on record prima facie evidence to show negligence on the part of respondent no.2 and that the death of deceased Ganesh was occurred in a motor vehicular accident. Hence, I answer point no.1 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO.2: ­ 13. In view of my affirmative finding on Issue No.1 in respect of the fact that, deceased Ganesh Wagh died on 25.02.2015 due to rash and negligent driving of ST Bus bearing registration No. MH­20­BL­ 2390 by its driver i.e. Respondent No.2, claimant No.1 to 3 being legal representatives of the deceased, they are certainly entitled for compensation under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act. The claimants came with a case that, they are dependent upon the income of the deceased. Claimant no.2 is the mother of the deceased and claimant no.3 is the minor sister and claimant no.1 is father of the deceased. He has no source of income. In absence of contrary evidence, along with mother, father of the deceased will be considered as dependent and, therefore, all the three claimants are certainly entitled for the ( 8 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) compensation on account of death of Ganesh Wagh. 14. Now coming to the aspect of compensation to be awarded to the claimants in the facts and circumstances of the case. It has come on record that, the deceased was the only son of claimants no.1 and 2. He was selected on merit basis and was pursuing his MBBS Degree in a prestigious institute like, Government Medical College, Aurangabad. At the time of accident, he was a student of MBBS Final Year and considering his calibre, amount of compensation to be awarded. The claimants have placed on record statements of marks obtained by the deceased in the examination of MBBS I, II and III Year. The evidence of CW­1 was not challenged on this point by the respondents. 15.In order to ascertain the income of the deceased, the claimants have examined CW­2 Mr.Umeshkumar Bhagwanrao Shahane at Exh­31 who is classmate of the deceased in MBBS Course. According to this witness, after completion of MBBS course, he joined service as medical officer at ESIS Hospital, Aurangabad and getting monthly salary of Rs.56,540/­. He placed on record copy of his appointment letter Exh­32 and copy of pay slip at Exh­33. Ld.Advocate for the claimants submitted that, considering the evidence of CW­2, it may be held that, at least the deceased would have earned monthly income of Rs.56,000/­. Considering this income, compensation be awarded. ( 9 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) 16.The documentary evidence placed on record would show that, deceased Ganesh Wagh was pursuing his MBBS degree and he was a student of MBBS Final Year in Government Medical College & Hospital, Aurangabad. No doubt, Mr.Umeshkumar (CW­2) is getting salary of Rs.56,540/­ per month. However, it can not be said that, the deceased would have got Government service and he would have earned that much amount. After completion of degree, he could have pursued his post­graduation or could have joined service but judicial note can be taken that, there is tremendous increase in demand for medical professionals and a person who has completed MBBS course will definitely earn not less than Rs.1,000/­ to Rs.1,200/­ per day if he starts his dispensary even in rural area. Taking into consideration this reality and the salary and allowances payable to a newly appointed medical officer in a Government service, it is fair and reasonable to assess future earning of the deceased at Rs.35,000/­ per month and in future he would earn more amount. Considering this aspect, future prospects are to be considered. 17. In a case of Rajesh and others Vs. Rajbir Singh and others, reported in 2013 (3) T.A.C. 697 (S.C.) , the Hon'ble Supreme Court clarified that in the case of self­employed or persons with fixed wages, in case, the deceased victim was below 40 years, there must be an addition of 50% to the actual income of the deceased while computing future prospects. We have to take into consideration the monthly income of the deceased at Rs.35,000/­ which comes to ( 10 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) Rs.4,20,000/­ per annum. The deceased was below 40 years of age. Therefore, I am inclined to give 50% increase in the annual income of Rs.4,20,000/­ which comes to Rs.2,10,000/­. Thus, yearly income of deceased for the purpose of calculation comes to Rs.6,30,000/­. (Rs.4,20,000/­ + Rs.2,10,000/­ = Rs.6,30,000/­). 18.In view of the guiding principle given in the case of Sarla Varma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another, reported in 2009 A.C.J. ­ 1298 where the deceased was a bachelor and the claimants are parents, normally 50% is deducted as personal and living expenses. Here in this case, undisputedly, the deceased was bachelor. Therefore, 50% amount is to be deducted from his annual income which comes to Rs.3,15,000/­. The remaining amount will be considered as annual contribution to the family by the deceased. Annual contribution to the family when multiplied by multiplier, gives loss of dependency to the family. The claimants have come with a case that, the age of the deceased was 24 years. However, they have not placed on record any documentary proof. In absence of documentary proof, we will have to consider the age mentioned in the Inquest Panchanama and Postmortem Examination Report. As per these two documents, the age of the deceased was 27 years. Therefore, as per the table finalised by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sarla Varma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another, reported in 2009 A.C.J. ­ 1298, the relevant multiplier for the age in between 26 to 30 comes to '17'. So, amount of Rs.3,15,000/­ X 17 which comes to net ( 11 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) compensation of Rs.53,55,000/­ as loss of dependency. 19. Claimants no.1 and 2 are the parents of the deceased. They had the only son who was taking education in Government Medical College, Aurangabad and it was a dream of the parents to see their son while practising in medical profession. They have been deprived of their dream and future prospects and love and affection of their deceased son. Death of the only son who is having a bright future is definitely shocking to the parents. Therefore, I am inclined to grant Rs.1 lakh towards love and affection and also conventional expenses of Rs.25,000/­ towards funeral expenses. 20.In view of my aforesaid discussion, I reached to the conclusion that, claimants no.1 to 3 are entitled to get total compensation of Rs.54,80,000/­ inclusive of the amount under no fault liability from the respondents which is just, fair and reasonable. Undisputedly, respondent No.2 was driver of ST Bus bearing registration No.MH­20­BL­2390 and at the time of accident, he was employee of respondent no.1. Thus, respondent No.1 i.e. MSRTC is vicariously liable for negligent act of its driver i.e. respondent No.2. In such circumstances, both the respondents are liable to pay compensation to the claimants for the death of deceased Ganesh Wagh in the road accident. So far as rate of interest is concerned, considering the amount of compensation, an interest @ 6% per annum from the date of petition till realization of the compensation amount would meet the ( 12 ) MACP NO. 241/2015 ( Judgment) ends of justice. Hence, I answer Issue No. 2 accordingly and pass the following order. ORDER 1)The petition is allowed, as under. 2)Claimant No. 1 to 3 are entitled to get total compensation of Rs.54,80,000/­ inclusive of the amount of 'No Fault Liability'. 3) Respondent No. 1 and 2 do pay an amount of Rs.54,30,000/­ (excluding NFL amount) towards compensation jointly or severally, to the claimants with interest @6% per annum from the date of institution of claim petition i.e. from 02.04.b2015 till realisation of entire amount. 4)The amount of compensation of Rs.54,30,000/­ be apportioned amongst the claimants as under: 1) Claimant No.1 : Rs24,00,000/­ + Interest + (Father) proportionate cost of the petition. 2) Claimant No. 2 : Rs.24,00,000/­ + Interest + (Mother) proportionate cost of the petition. 3) Claimant No. 3 : Rs.6,30,000/­+ Interest + (Sister) proportionate cost of the petition. 5)Out of the amount of compensation of Rs.24,00,000/­ payable to Claimant No.1, an amount of Rs.20,00,000/­ be invested in fixed deposit in his name in any Nationalized Bank, as per his choice for a period of five years with a liberty to withdraw the interest amount accrued on the fixed deposit amount quarterly if he desired and the remaining amount of Rs.4,00,000/­ alongwith interest be paid to him in person by issuing an account payee cheque.

REASONS As to issue No. 1 : 5]Claimant No. 6, Nagorao s/o Shamrao Mokase, CW1 Bharati V/s Iqbal & others. 5 Judgment ­ MACP No.294/2015 has filed affidavit Exh. 15 in view of Examination in Chief. He stated that, the deceased Kiran Mokase was riding motorcycle, bearing registration No. MH­20­GG­2738 on 07­04­2015. The accident took place at about 02:00 to 02:30 p.m. on Jalgaon­ Aurangabad road, near Golegaon village in front of Sham Dhaba. The deceased was proceeding from Jalna to Aurangabad direction. The S.T.Bus bearing registration No. MH­40­N­9818 being driven by respondent No. 1 came in high and excessive speed from the back side. It was being driven in rash and negligent manner. The S.T.Bus gave dash to the said motorcycle from back side. Due to dash given by the S.T.Bus, Kiran Mokase died on the spot. He was shifted to Primary Health Center Sillod. The Medical Officer conducted Postmortem examination over the dead body. 6]He further deposed that, crime No. I­47/15 came to be registered under Sections 304­A, 279, 337 and 338 of the Indian Penal Code against the bus driver, respondent No. 1. He also produced on record true copies of first information Exh. 17, spot Panchanama Exh. 18, inquest panchanama Exh. 19, original P.M. report Exh. 21 and Form""AA"" Exh. 22. 7]There is nothing in the cross examination of claimant Bharati V/s Iqbal & others. 6 Judgment ­ MACP No.294/2015 to discredit to his oral evidence. The perusal of the FIR Exh. 17 shows that, the S.T.Bus gave dash to the motorcycle from the back side. The dash was given in excessive force. The S.T.Bus was being driven at high speed. The spot panchanama Exh. 18 shows that, the S.T.Bus gave dash to a tree situated on the north side of the road. This fact is sufficient to establish that, the S.T.Bus was being driven at high and excessive speed. The P.M. report Exh. 21 reveals that, deceased died due to multiple fracture injuries. Hence, issue No. 1 is hereby answered in the affirmative. As to issue No. 2 :­ 8]Thus considering the oral and document evidence, this Court has come to the conclusion that, Kiran Mokase died due to injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident on 07­04­2015. Hence, Point No. 1 is hereby answered in the affirmative. The fact that, the S.T.Bus gave dash to the standing tree and the radiator of the bus was damaged badly, establish that, the S.T.Bus was driven in a rash and negligent manner in high and excessive speed. Moreover, the dash was given from the back side to motorcycle by the S.T.Bus. All these facts established that, the S.T.Bus was been driven rashly and negligently. Hence, issue No. 2 is hereby answered in the affirmative. Bharati V/s Iqbal & others. 7 Judgment ­ MACP No.294/2015 As to issue Nos. 3 to 5 : 9]The claimant has deposed that, the age of deceased was 32 years at the time of accident. The claimant has produced on record the extract of school register vide Exh. 16. It shows 19­ 03­1983 as the date of birth of Kiran Mokase. Therefore, the age of the deceased on the date of the accident comes about 32 years. The multiplier of 16 will have to be taken. 10]The claimant has further deposed that, the deceased was earning Rs. 8,000/­ per month. He was working with Renuka Traders, Pishor Tal. Kannad. CW2 Satish Mokase has deposed vide Exh. 23 that, he employed Kiran Mokase. Teh monthly salary of deceased was Rs. 8,000/­ per month. He proved salary sleep Exh. 24. In his cross examination he stated that, he is submitting income tax returns. The payments made to Kiran Mokase were shown in the returns however he has not produced copies of income tax returns on record. Still there is nothing in his examination that, he was deposing false. Therefore this Court has come to the conclusion that the monthly income of the deceased was Rs. 8,000/­ per month. His annual income was about Rs. 96,000/­ per annum. Bharati V/s Iqbal & others. 8 Judgment ­ MACP No.294/2015 11]Respondent Nos. 2 to 4 are children of the deceased. Respondent No. 1 is his wife. Thus there are more than five persons dependent on the income of the deceased. Hence, personal deduction of deceased is taken as 1/5. The total dependency of the claimants will have to be taken as 76800/­ per annum. The multiplier of 16 is already selected. Thus the total dependency comes about Rs. 12,28,800/­ (76800X16). 12]The claimant No. 1 is wife of the deceased.

He stated that, the deceased Kiran Mokase was riding motorcycle, bearing registration No. MH­20­GG­2738 on 07­04­2015. The accident took place at about 02:00 to 02:30 p.m. on Jalgaon­ Aurangabad road, near Golegaon village in front of Sham Dhaba. The deceased was proceeding from Jalna to Aurangabad direction. The S.T.Bus bearing registration No. MH­40­N­9818 being driven by respondent No. 1 came in high and excessive speed from the back side. It was being driven in rash and negligent manner. The S.T.Bus gave dash to the said motorcycle from back side. Due to dash given by the S.T.Bus, Kiran Mokase died on the spot. He was shifted to Primary Health Center Sillod. The Medical Officer conducted Postmortem examination over the dead body. 6]He further deposed that, crime No. I­47/15 came to be registered under Sections 304­A, 279, 337 and 338 of the Indian Penal Code against the bus driver, respondent No. 1. He also produced on record true copies of first information Exh. 17, spot Panchanama Exh. 18, inquest panchanama Exh. 19, original P.M. report Exh. 21 and Form""AA"" Exh. 22. 7]There is nothing in the cross examination of claimant Bharati V/s Iqbal & others. 6 Judgment ­ MACP No.294/2015 to discredit to his oral evidence. The perusal of the FIR Exh. 17 shows that, the S.T.Bus gave dash to the motorcycle from the back side. The dash was given in excessive force. The S.T.Bus was being driven at high speed. The spot panchanama Exh. 18 shows that, the S.T.Bus gave dash to a tree situated on the north side of the road. This fact is sufficient to establish that, the S.T.Bus was being driven at high and excessive speed. The P.M. report Exh. 21 reveals that, deceased died due to multiple fracture injuries. Hence, issue No. 1 is hereby answered in the affirmative. As to issue No. 2 :­ 8]Thus considering the oral and document evidence, this Court has come to the conclusion that, Kiran Mokase died due to injuries sustained in the motor vehicle accident on 07­04­2015. Hence, Point No. 1 is hereby answered in the affirmative. The fact that, the S.T.Bus gave dash to the standing tree and the radiator of the bus was damaged badly, establish that, the S.T.Bus was driven in a rash and negligent manner in high and excessive speed. Moreover, the dash was given from the back side to motorcycle by the S.T.Bus. All these facts established that, the S.T.Bus was been driven rashly and negligently. Hence, issue No. 2 is hereby answered in the affirmative. Bharati V/s Iqbal & others. 7 Judgment ­ MACP No.294/2015 As to issue Nos. 3 to 5 : 9]The claimant has deposed that, the age of deceased was 32 years at the time of accident. The claimant has produced on record the extract of school register vide Exh. 16. It shows 19­ 03­1983 as the date of birth of Kiran Mokase. Therefore, the age of the deceased on the date of the accident comes about 32 years. The multiplier of 16 will have to be taken. 10]The claimant has further deposed that, the deceased was earning Rs. 8,000/­ per month. He was working with Renuka Traders, Pishor Tal. Kannad. CW2 Satish Mokase has deposed vide Exh. 23 that, he employed Kiran Mokase. Teh monthly salary of deceased was Rs. 8,000/­ per month. He proved salary sleep Exh. 24. In his cross examination he stated that, he is submitting income tax returns. The payments made to Kiran Mokase were shown in the returns however he has not produced copies of income tax returns on record. Still there is nothing in his examination that, he was deposing false. Therefore this Court has come to the conclusion that the monthly income of the deceased was Rs. 8,000/­ per month. His annual income was about Rs. 96,000/­ per annum. Bharati V/s Iqbal & others. 8 Judgment ­ MACP No.294/2015 11]Respondent Nos. 2 to 4 are children of the deceased. Respondent No. 1 is his wife. Thus there are more than five persons dependent on the income of the deceased. Hence, personal deduction of deceased is taken as 1/5. The total dependency of the claimants will have to be taken as 76800/­ per annum. The multiplier of 16 is already selected. Thus the total dependency comes about Rs. 12,28,800/­ (76800X16). 12]The claimant No. 1 is wife of the deceased. Therefore, she is entitled to Rs. 8,00,000/­ towards loss of consortium as held in the case of Smt. Savita V/s Bindersingh and others reported in (2014) 4 S.C.C. 505. 13]The claimants are entitled to Rs. 25,000/­ for funeral expenses. 14]Each of claimant Nos. 2 to 4 are entitled to Rs. 1,00,000/­ towards loss of love and affection due to loss of their father as per decision of Supreme Court in case of Juju Kuruvila and others V/s Kuajujamma Mohan and others reported in (2013) 9 S.C.C. 166.

J U D G M E N T [ Delivered on 1st November, 2017 ] The present petition is filed under Section 166 of Motor Vehicles 2 M.A.C.P.No.700/2015, [ Judgment ]. Act, 1988, on account of injuries sustained by the claimant in motor vehicular accident held on 22.04.2015. 2.Brief facts of the case­ It is the case of claimant that on 22.04.2015 at about 10.00 p.m. the claimant was proceeding on his motorcycle bearing registration No.MH­20­ DK.1886 from Deolai Chowk, Beed by pass road. At that time, Honda City Car bearing registration No. MH­20­CS­0494 came in rash and negligent manner without following traffic rules and gave dash to the motorcycle of claimant. Due to said dash, the claimant sustained serious injuries on his right hand, left shoulder and other parts of the body. The claimant was immediately shifted to Hedgewar Hospital, Aurangabad for treatment where the claimant has taken treatment from 22.04.2015 to 24.04.2015 as indoor patient. Thereafter, again from 04.05.2015 to 07.05.2015 the claimant was admitted in Hedgewar Hospital as indoor patient for treatment. During the course of treatment, the doctors operated the injuries of claimant and inserted rod in his right leg. 3.The claimant further contended that on the basis of report lodged by him, Satara Police Station, Aurangabad registered Crime bearing No.I­81/2015 under Section 279, 337, 338 of IPC against respondent No.1 the driver of offending vehicle Honda City Car bearing registration No.MH­20­CS­0494. 4.The claimant further contended that at the time of accident, he was working with Hedgewar Hospital, Aurangabad as staff and getting monthly salary 3 M.A.C.P.No.700/2015, [ Judgment ]. of Rs.17,500/­. Apart from that claimant was having his own ambulance bearing registration No. MH­04­H­604 and by driving said ambulance, he was earning handsome income of Rs.20,000/­ per month and maintaining his family. The claimant further contended that during the course of treatment, he has incurred huge expenses to the tune of Rs.3,00,000/­. He further contended that during the course of treatment doctors have advised him to take complete bed rest and for the purpose of future medical treatment the claimant will require an amount of Rs.1,50,000/­. The claimant further contended that before the accident, he was leading his life without any disability and was maintaining his family members by doing private service and driving his own ambulance. The claimant further contended that after the said accident, the authorities of Hedgewar Hospital has removed him from service as he is unable to work and now he is not in a position to drive ambulance because of which he is suffering financial losses. 5.He further contended that respondent No.1 was the owner and driver of offending Honda City Car bearing registration No. MH­20­CS­0494. The same was insured with respondent No.2, at the time of accident. Therefore, respondent No.1 & 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to him. Thus, the claimant has claimed total compensation of Rs.7,00,000/­ including compensation under other conventional heads. 6.Respondent No.1 filed his written statement at Exh­14. He denied all adverse contentions of claimant. He further contended that he is running 4 M.A.C.P.No.700/2015, [ Judgment ]. business of granite under the name and style Jai Bhavani Granites, on Beed by pass road, Balapur, Aurangabad. On 22.04.2015 after closing his unit, he was proceeding towards Nageshwarwadi in his car bearing registration No.MH­20­ CS­0494. When he reached in­front of Hiwale Lawns at about 10.00 p.m., he saw that one motorcycle rider had fallen on the road due to dash given by unknown vehicle. The rider of said motorcycle was crying for help, therefore, he parked his vehicle towards left side of road and inquired with rider of motorcycle. After inquiry, he came to know the name of rider as Dnyaneshwar Govindrao Nikalje i.e. claimant. As the claimant was having severe injuries, he requested him to take him to Hedgewar Hospital, Aurangabad for medical treatment. Accordingly, at the instance of claimant, he took claimant to Hedgewar Hospital for medical treatment and after admitting him, left the hospital and proceeded towards his house. He further contended that his vehicle is not at all involved in the said accident. False report is lodged by the claimant against him so as to claim compensation. He further denied age, income of the claimant and submitted that the petition be rejected. 7.Respondent No.2 filed their written statement at Exh­18. They denied all adverse contentions of claimant. They further denied the age, income of claimant and submitted that the petition be rejected. 8.From the rival pleadings of the parties, I have framed following issues at Exh­23 and I record my findings thereto for the reasons stated below. 5 M.A.C.P.No.700/2015, [ Judgment ]. I S S U E S F I N D I N G S 1.Whether the claimant proves that he sustained injuries on 22.04.2015, at about 10.00 p.m., opposite Hiwale Lawn, Beed Bye pass, Aurangabad in a motor vehicular accident ? .. Yes. 2.Whether the claimant proves that the accident took place because of negligent driving of respondent No.1 while driving Honda City Car bearing registration No.MH­20­CS­0494 ? .. Yes. 3.Whether the claimant is entitled to get compensation ? If yes, to what extent & from whom ? .. Rs.2,50,520/­ from respondent No.1 & 2 jointly & severally @ 8% interest P.A. 4.What order and award ? .. Claim is partly allowed. R E A S O N S 9.In order to substantiate the contentions raised in the petition, claimant examined himself as CW1 at Exh­25 and Dr. Parmeshwar Shivlal Jaiswal as CW2 at Exh­40 and produced certified copies of relevant police papers pertaining to the accident in question. They are FIR at Exh­31, Spot Panchanama at Exh­32, M.L.C. at Exh­32­A, Medical Certificate at Exh­33, Driving License of respondent No.1 at Exh­34, Registration Certificate of offending vehicle at Exh­35, Insurance Policy at Exh­36, Form No.54 at Exh­37, Disability Certificate at Exh­41 and filed evidence close Pursis at Exh­43. 6 M.A.C.P.No.700/2015, [ Judgment ]. 10.Respondent No.1 did not lead any evidence and filed his evidence close Pursis at Exh­46. 11.Respondent No.2 also did not lead any evidence and filed evidence close Pursis at Exh­47. As to Point No.1 & 2 : 12.The Learned advocate appearing for claimant submitted that the police papers pertaining to the accident in question clearly indicates that the respondent No.1 was driving his Car bearing registration No.MH­20­CS­0494 in rash and negligent manner and gave dash to the motorcycle of claimant because of which the claimant has sustained grievous injuries. He further submitted that the respondent No.1 was owner/driver of offending car. The same was insured with respondent No.2. Therefore, respondent No.1 & 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the claimant. 13.The Learned advocate appearing for respondent No.2 submitted that the claimant claims that the accident has happened on 22.04.2015. The report is lodged about the accident on 01.05.2015. The delay in lodging report is not explained by the claimant which fact clearly shows that his vehicle bearing registration No.MH­20­CS­0494 is not involved in the accident and submitted that the petition be rejected. 14.Having considered the oral submissions on behalf of claimant and respondents, I have gone through oral as well as documentary evidence placed on 7 M.A.C.P.No.700/2015, [ Judgment ]. record by claimant. It is seen from the record that MLC of said accident was reported on 23.04.2015 at about 2.30 a.m. The claimant has produced said MLC at Exh­32­A. It also appears that the spot panchanama was carried by the police on 23.04.2015. Therefore, the delay in lodging FIR does not fatal the contentions of claimant that the accident has occurred on 22.04.2015. 15.The FIR at Exh­31 and the other relevant police papers clearly shows that the respondent No.1 was driving his car bearing registration No.MH­ 20­CS­0494 in rash and negligent manner and gave dash to the motorcycle of claimant. The respondent No.1 has not stepped into witness­box so as to rebut the testimony of claimant as well as the police papers filed by claimant on record, neither he has produced any material on record to show that he has challenged the FIR or have made any complaint to the higher authorities that his vehicle is not involved in the accident. In absence of any rebuttal evidence against the evidence of claimant, it cannot be said that the vehicle of respondent No.1 is falsely involved in the accident. Hence, I answer Issue No.1 & 2 as 'Yes'. As to Issue No.3 : 16.The claimant has deposed in his affidavit of evidence at Exh­25 that at the time of accident, he was 32 years old and was possessing good and sound health and was leading free life without any disability. He further deposed that he was doing private service with Hedgewar Hospital, Aurangabad and was earning Rs.17,500/­ per month. He has further deposed that he was owner of ambulance 8 M.A.C.P.No.700/2015, [ Judgment ]. and by plying the said ambulance, he was earning handsome income of Rs.20,000/­ per month. To show that the claimant was working with Hedgewar Hospital and plying private ambulance, he has not produced any documentary evidence or any other evidence and earning Rs.37,500/­ per month. In absence of any evidence about the income of the claimant, it will be appropriate to take Rs.4,500/­ as notional income of claimant. The annual income of the claimant comes to Rs.54,000/­. 17.The claimant has deposed in his affidavit of evidence that at the time of accident, his age was 32 years but has not filed any document on record in support of his age. The claimant has filed MLC at Exh­32­A and Medical Certificate at Exh­33. The age of the claimant mentioned in both the documents is 32 years. Therefore, it will be appropriate to consider his age as 32 years at the time of accident. Therefore, the multiplier of 16 is applied as per the guidelines issued by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sarla Verma vs Delhi Transport Corporation and another reported in AIR 2009 SC 3104 . By applying multiplier of 16 to the income of Rs.54,000/­, the loss of earning comes to Rs.8,64,000/­. 18.The claimant has examined Dr. Parmeshwar Shivlal Jaiswal orthopedic surgeon who has deposed that claimant was operated for dynamic screw at lateral condyle of tibia right side. He has scar of operation at right knee measuring 7 Cms. He has shortening of right leg by 1 Cm. He has restriction of 9 M.A.C.P.No.700/2015, [ Judgment ]. movement of right knee, flexion by 20 degree. He cannot squatt or sit cross legged. He has permanent disability 18% by MC bride scale. The disability certificate produced by CW2 at Exh­41, shows that the claimant is suffering 18% disability. Therefore, 18% of Rs.8,64,000/­ comes to Rs. 1,55,520/­ which is loss of earning of claimant. 19.It has also come in the evidence that the claimant has suffered injuries because of the motor accident. Therefore, in my opinion, it would be just and proper to grant compensation to the claimant for the pains, damages and mental trauma suffered by him. Hence, I grant Rs.50,000/­ for the damages, pains and mental trauma suffered by the claimant because of the motor accident. 20.It also appears from the evidence of CW2 the doctor examined by the claimant to prove the disability certificate that the claimant was operated for dynamic screw at lateral condyle of tibia right side during the course of treatment. Therefore, in my opinion, it will be appropriate to grant an amount of Rs.50,000/­ to the claimant towards expenses incurred on his medical treatment. Therefore, the claimant is entitle to total compensation of Rs.2,55,520/­. 21.It appears from the record that the claimant has received an amount of Rs.25,000/­ towards interim compensation. Therefore, it will be appropriate to deduct the said amount from total compensation. After deducting Rs.25,000/­ from the amount of Rs.2,55,520/­, it comes to Rs.2,30,520/­. 22.Taking into consideration, the period of pendency of claim petition 10 M.A.C.P.No.700/2015, [ Judgment ]. and the amount of compensation, it will be appropriate to grant interest @8% per annum from the date of filing petition till the realization of entire compensation. Accordingly, I answer Issue No.3 and proceed to pass following order. O R D E R 1.The petition is partly allowed. 2.The claimant is entitle to total compensation of Rs.2,55,520/­ inclusive of No Fault Liability. 3.The respondent No.1 & 2 do pay an amount of Rs.2,30,520/­ as compensation exclusive of No Fault Liability to the claimant jointly and severally along with interest 8% per annum from the date of filing of petition, till realization of entire amount. 4.The amount of compensation be paid to the claimant by account payee cheque on proper identification. 5.The respondent No.1 & 2 do pay proportionate cost of the petition to the claimant and bear their own cost. 6.Award be drawn accordingly.

J U D G M E N T [ Delivered on 1st November, 2017 ] The present petition is filed under Section 166 of Motor Vehicles 2 M.A.C.P.No.700/2015, [ Judgment ]. Act, 1988, on account of injuries sustained by the claimant in motor vehicular accident held on 22.04.2015. 2.Brief facts of the case­ It is the case of claimant that on 22.04.2015 at about 10.00 p.m. the claimant was proceeding on his motorcycle bearing registration No.MH­20­ DK.1886 from Deolai Chowk, Beed by pass road. At that time, Honda City Car bearing registration No. MH­20­CS­0494 came in rash and negligent manner without following traffic rules and gave dash to the motorcycle of claimant. Due to said dash, the claimant sustained serious injuries on his right hand, left shoulder and other parts of the body. The claimant was immediately shifted to Hedgewar Hospital, Aurangabad for treatment where the claimant has taken treatment from 22.04.2015 to 24.04.2015 as indoor patient. Thereafter, again from 04.05.2015 to 07.05.2015 the claimant was admitted in Hedgewar Hospital as indoor patient for treatment. During the course of treatment, the doctors operated the injuries of claimant and inserted rod in his right leg. 3.The claimant further contended that on the basis of report lodged by him, Satara Police Station, Aurangabad registered Crime bearing No.I­81/2015 under Section 279, 337, 338 of IPC against respondent No.1 the driver of offending vehicle Honda City Car bearing registration No.MH­20­CS­0494. 4.The claimant further contended that at the time of accident, he was working with Hedgewar Hospital, Aurangabad as staff and getting monthly salary 3 M.A.C.P.No.700/2015, [ Judgment ]. of Rs.17,500/­. Apart from that claimant was having his own ambulance bearing registration No. MH­04­H­604 and by driving said ambulance, he was earning handsome income of Rs.20,000/­ per month and maintaining his family. The claimant further contended that during the course of treatment, he has incurred huge expenses to the tune of Rs.3,00,000/­. He further contended that during the course of treatment doctors have advised him to take complete bed rest and for the purpose of future medical treatment the claimant will require an amount of Rs.1,50,000/­. The claimant further contended that before the accident, he was leading his life without any disability and was maintaining his family members by doing private service and driving his own ambulance. The claimant further contended that after the said accident, the authorities of Hedgewar Hospital has removed him from service as he is unable to work and now he is not in a position to drive ambulance because of which he is suffering financial losses. 5.He further contended that respondent No.1 was the owner and driver of offending Honda City Car bearing registration No. MH­20­CS­0494. The same was insured with respondent No.2, at the time of accident. Therefore, respondent No.1 & 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to him. Thus, the claimant has claimed total compensation of Rs.7,00,000/­ including compensation under other conventional heads. 6.Respondent No.1 filed his written statement at Exh­14. He denied all adverse contentions of claimant. He further contended that he is running 4 M.A.C.P.No.700/2015, [ Judgment ]. business of granite under the name and style Jai Bhavani Granites, on Beed by pass road, Balapur, Aurangabad. On 22.04.2015 after closing his unit, he was proceeding towards Nageshwarwadi in his car bearing registration No.MH­20­ CS­0494. When he reached in­front of Hiwale Lawns at about 10.00 p.m., he saw that one motorcycle rider had fallen on the road due to dash given by unknown vehicle. The rider of said motorcycle was crying for help, therefore, he parked his vehicle towards left side of road and inquired with rider of motorcycle. After inquiry, he came to know the name of rider as Dnyaneshwar Govindrao Nikalje i.e. claimant. As the claimant was having severe injuries, he requested him to take him to Hedgewar Hospital, Aurangabad for medical treatment. Accordingly, at the instance of claimant, he took claimant to Hedgewar Hospital for medical treatment and after admitting him, left the hospital and proceeded towards his house. He further contended that his vehicle is not at all involved in the said accident. False report is lodged by the claimant against him so as to claim compensation. He further denied age, income of the claimant and submitted that the petition be rejected. 7.Respondent No.2 filed their written statement at Exh­18. They denied all adverse contentions of claimant. They further denied the age, income of claimant and submitted that the petition be rejected. 8.From the rival pleadings of the parties, I have framed following issues at Exh­23 and I record my findings thereto for the reasons stated below. 5 M.A.C.P.No.700/2015, [ Judgment ]. I S S U E S F I N D I N G S 1.Whether the claimant proves that he sustained injuries on 22.04.2015, at about 10.00 p.m., opposite Hiwale Lawn, Beed Bye pass, Aurangabad in a motor vehicular accident ? .. Yes. 2.Whether the claimant proves that the accident took place because of negligent driving of respondent No.1 while driving Honda City Car bearing registration No.MH­20­CS­0494 ? .. Yes. 3.Whether the claimant is entitled to get compensation ? If yes, to what extent & from whom ? .. Rs.2,50,520/­ from respondent No.1 & 2 jointly & severally @ 8% interest P.A. 4.What order and award ? .. Claim is partly allowed. R E A S O N S 9.In order to substantiate the contentions raised in the petition, claimant examined himself as CW1 at Exh­25 and Dr. Parmeshwar Shivlal Jaiswal as CW2 at Exh­40 and produced certified copies of relevant police papers pertaining to the accident in question. They are FIR at Exh­31, Spot Panchanama at Exh­32, M.L.C. at Exh­32­A, Medical Certificate at Exh­33, Driving License of respondent No.1 at Exh­34, Registration Certificate of offending vehicle at Exh­35, Insurance Policy at Exh­36, Form No.54 at Exh­37, Disability Certificate at Exh­41 and filed evidence close Pursis at Exh­43. 6 M.A.C.P.No.700/2015, [ Judgment ]. 10.Respondent No.1 did not lead any evidence and filed his evidence close Pursis at Exh­46. 11.Respondent No.2 also did not lead any evidence and filed evidence close Pursis at Exh­47. As to Point No.1 & 2 : 12.The Learned advocate appearing for claimant submitted that the police papers pertaining to the accident in question clearly indicates that the respondent No.1 was driving his Car bearing registration No.MH­20­CS­0494 in rash and negligent manner and gave dash to the motorcycle of claimant because of which the claimant has sustained grievous injuries. He further submitted that the respondent No.1 was owner/driver of offending car. The same was insured with respondent No.2. Therefore, respondent No.1 & 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the claimant. 13.The Learned advocate appearing for respondent No.2 submitted that the claimant claims that the accident has happened on 22.04.2015. The report is lodged about the accident on 01.05.2015. The delay in lodging report is not explained by the claimant which fact clearly shows that his vehicle bearing registration No.MH­20­CS­0494 is not involved in the accident and submitted that the petition be rejected. 14.Having considered the oral submissions on behalf of claimant and respondents, I have gone through oral as well as documentary evidence placed on 7 M.A.C.P.No.700/2015, [ Judgment ]. record by claimant. It is seen from the record that MLC of said accident was reported on 23.04.2015 at about 2.30 a.m. The claimant has produced said MLC at Exh­32­A. It also appears that the spot panchanama was carried by the police on 23.04.2015. Therefore, the delay in lodging FIR does not fatal the contentions of claimant that the accident has occurred on 22.04.2015. 15.The FIR at Exh­31 and the other relevant police papers clearly shows that the respondent No.1 was driving his car bearing registration No.MH­ 20­CS­0494 in rash and negligent manner and gave dash to the motorcycle of claimant. The respondent No.1 has not stepped into witness­box so as to rebut the testimony of claimant as well as the police papers filed by claimant on record, neither he has produced any material on record to show that he has challenged the FIR or have made any complaint to the higher authorities that his vehicle is not involved in the accident. In absence of any rebuttal evidence against the evidence of claimant, it cannot be said that the vehicle of respondent No.1 is falsely involved in the accident. Hence, I answer Issue No.1 & 2 as 'Yes'. As to Issue No.3 : 16.The claimant has deposed in his affidavit of evidence at Exh­25 that at the time of accident, he was 32 years old and was possessing good and sound health and was leading free life without any disability. He further deposed that he was doing private service with Hedgewar Hospital, Aurangabad and was earning Rs.17,500/­ per month. He has further deposed that he was owner of ambulance 8 M.A.C.P.No.700/2015, [ Judgment ]. and by plying the said ambulance, he was earning handsome income of Rs.20,000/­ per month. To show that the claimant was working with Hedgewar Hospital and plying private ambulance, he has not produced any documentary evidence or any other evidence and earning Rs.37,500/­ per month. In absence of any evidence about the income of the claimant, it will be appropriate to take Rs.4,500/­ as notional income of claimant. The annual income of the claimant comes to Rs.54,000/­. 17.The claimant has deposed in his affidavit of evidence that at the time of accident, his age was 32 years but has not filed any document on record in support of his age. The claimant has filed MLC at Exh­32­A and Medical Certificate at Exh­33. The age of the claimant mentioned in both the documents is 32 years. Therefore, it will be appropriate to consider his age as 32 years at the time of accident. Therefore, the multiplier of 16 is applied as per the guidelines issued by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sarla Verma vs Delhi Transport Corporation and another reported in AIR 2009 SC 3104 . By applying multiplier of 16 to the income of Rs.54,000/­, the loss of earning comes to Rs.8,64,000/­. 18.The claimant has examined Dr. Parmeshwar Shivlal Jaiswal orthopedic surgeon who has deposed that claimant was operated for dynamic screw at lateral condyle of tibia right side. He has scar of operation at right knee measuring 7 Cms. He has shortening of right leg by 1 Cm. He has restriction of 9 M.A.C.P.No.700/2015, [ Judgment ]. movement of right knee, flexion by 20 degree. He cannot squatt or sit cross legged. He has permanent disability 18% by MC bride scale. The disability certificate produced by CW2 at Exh­41, shows that the claimant is suffering 18% disability. Therefore, 18% of Rs.8,64,000/­ comes to Rs. 1,55,520/­ which is loss of earning of claimant. 19.It has also come in the evidence that the claimant has suffered injuries because of the motor accident. Therefore, in my opinion, it would be just and proper to grant compensation to the claimant for the pains, damages and mental trauma suffered by him. Hence, I grant Rs.50,000/­ for the damages, pains and mental trauma suffered by the claimant because of the motor accident. 20.It also appears from the evidence of CW2 the doctor examined by the claimant to prove the disability certificate that the claimant was operated for dynamic screw at lateral condyle of tibia right side during the course of treatment. Therefore, in my opinion, it will be appropriate to grant an amount of Rs.50,000/­ to the claimant towards expenses incurred on his medical treatment. Therefore, the claimant is entitle to total compensation of Rs.2,55,520/­. 21.It appears from the record that the claimant has received an amount of Rs.25,000/­ towards interim compensation. Therefore, it will be appropriate to deduct the said amount from total compensation. After deducting Rs.25,000/­ from the amount of Rs.2,55,520/­, it comes to Rs.2,30,520/­. 22.Taking into consideration, the period of pendency of claim petition 10 M.A.C.P.No.700/2015, [ Judgment ]. and the amount of compensation, it will be appropriate to grant interest @8% per annum from the date of filing petition till the realization of entire compensation. Accordingly, I answer Issue No.3 and proceed to pass following order. O R D E R 1.The petition is partly allowed. 2.The claimant is entitle to total compensation of Rs.2,55,520/­ inclusive of No Fault Liability. 3.The respondent No.1 & 2 do pay an amount of Rs.2,30,520/­ as compensation exclusive of No Fault Liability to the claimant jointly and severally along with interest 8% per annum from the date of filing of petition, till realization of entire amount. 4.The amount of compensation be paid to the claimant by account payee cheque on proper identification. 5.The respondent No.1 & 2 do pay proportionate cost of the petition to the claimant and bear their own cost. 6.Award be drawn accordingly.

He has further deposed that he was owner of ambulance 8 M.A.C.P.No.700/2015, [ Judgment ]. and by plying the said ambulance, he was earning handsome income of Rs.20,000/­ per month. To show that the claimant was working with Hedgewar Hospital and plying private ambulance, he has not produced any documentary evidence or any other evidence and earning Rs.37,500/­ per month. In absence of any evidence about the income of the claimant, it will be appropriate to take Rs.4,500/­ as notional income of claimant. The annual income of the claimant comes to Rs.54,000/­. 17.The claimant has deposed in his affidavit of evidence that at the time of accident, his age was 32 years but has not filed any document on record in support of his age. The claimant has filed MLC at Exh­32­A and Medical Certificate at Exh­33. The age of the claimant mentioned in both the documents is 32 years. Therefore, it will be appropriate to consider his age as 32 years at the time of accident. Therefore, the multiplier of 16 is applied as per the guidelines issued by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sarla Verma vs Delhi Transport Corporation and another reported in AIR 2009 SC 3104 . By applying multiplier of 16 to the income of Rs.54,000/­, the loss of earning comes to Rs.8,64,000/­. 18.The claimant has examined Dr. Parmeshwar Shivlal Jaiswal orthopedic surgeon who has deposed that claimant was operated for dynamic screw at lateral condyle of tibia right side. He has scar of operation at right knee measuring 7 Cms. He has shortening of right leg by 1 Cm. He has restriction of 9 M.A.C.P.No.700/2015, [ Judgment ]. movement of right knee, flexion by 20 degree. He cannot squatt or sit cross legged. He has permanent disability 18% by MC bride scale. The disability certificate produced by CW2 at Exh­41, shows that the claimant is suffering 18% disability. Therefore, 18% of Rs.8,64,000/­ comes to Rs. 1,55,520/­ which is loss of earning of claimant. 19.It has also come in the evidence that the claimant has suffered injuries because of the motor accident. Therefore, in my opinion, it would be just and proper to grant compensation to the claimant for the pains, damages and mental trauma suffered by him. Hence, I grant Rs.50,000/­ for the damages, pains and mental trauma suffered by the claimant because of the motor accident. 20.It also appears from the evidence of CW2 the doctor examined by the claimant to prove the disability certificate that the claimant was operated for dynamic screw at lateral condyle of tibia right side during the course of treatment. Therefore, in my opinion, it will be appropriate to grant an amount of Rs.50,000/­ to the claimant towards expenses incurred on his medical treatment. Therefore, the claimant is entitle to total compensation of Rs.2,55,520/­. 21.It appears from the record that the claimant has received an amount of Rs.25,000/­ towards interim compensation. Therefore, it will be appropriate to deduct the said amount from total compensation. After deducting Rs.25,000/­ from the amount of Rs.2,55,520/­, it comes to Rs.2,30,520/­. 22.Taking into consideration, the period of pendency of claim petition 10 M.A.C.P.No.700/2015, [ Judgment ]. and the amount of compensation, it will be appropriate to grant interest @8% per annum from the date of filing petition till the realization of entire compensation. Accordingly, I answer Issue No.3 and proceed to pass following order. O R D E R 1.The petition is partly allowed. 2.The claimant is entitle to total compensation of Rs.2,55,520/­ inclusive of No Fault Liability. 3.The respondent No.1 & 2 do pay an amount of Rs.2,30,520/­ as compensation exclusive of No Fault Liability to the claimant jointly and severally along with interest 8% per annum from the date of filing of petition, till realization of entire amount. 4.The amount of compensation be paid to the claimant by account payee cheque on proper identification. 5.The respondent No.1 & 2 do pay proportionate cost of the petition to the claimant and bear their own cost. 6.Award be drawn accordingly.

Shri. P . B. Khedkar, Advocate for the claimant. Shri R. K. Dharpale, Advocate for Respondents no.1 & 2. Shri R.B.Bhosale, Advocate for respondent No.3. .......................................................................................... JUDGMENT ( Delivered on 27­08­2018 ) 1]This is an application under section 166 of the Motor 2 [MACP No.446/2015 [J] Vehicles Act, 1988, claiming compensation on account of the personal injuries sustained by applicant Sk.Nasir Sk.Khabir in motor accident dated 23.12.2014 near Palaswadi Village on Aurangabad – Kannad Road involving Car bearing Registration No.MH­20­AG­5613. 2]Brief facts of the petition are as under : On 23.12.2014 at about 07­30 p.m., the claimant was travelling on his motorcycle bearing registration No.MH­20­BJ­9104 from Aurangabad to Kannad. When he reached near Palaswadi village, at that time, one Car bearing Registration No.MH­20­AG­ 5613 driven by respondent no.1 in a rash and negligent manner and in high speed gave dash to the motorcycle of the claimant. Due to severe dash, the claimant sustained serious injuries on several parts of body and sustained fracture to his right leg. Immediately, the claimant was shifted to MGM Hospital, Aurangabad for medical treatment where he was treated as indoor patient from 23.12.2014 to 24.12.2014. He is not completely cured. 3]On the basis of complaint filed by claimant, Khultabad Police Station registered Crime no. I­188/2014 against respondent no.1 i.e. driver of Car bearing Registration No.MH­20­AG­5613 for offences punishable under sections 279, 337, 338, 427 of Indian Penal Code and u/S.134/177 of the Motor Vehicles Act. 4]According to the applicant, prior to alleged accident he 3 [MACP No.446/2015 [J] was able bodied person running gold shop and doing the work of preparing gold ornaments and maintaining himself and his family. Due to the accident he has sustained serious injury and became 15% permanent disabled. Therefore, he claimed sum of Rs.5,00,000/­ as a compensation from respondents jointly and severally under all permissible heads. 5]Respondents no.1 and 2 filed their Written Statement vide Exh.19 and opposed the claim of claimant. Respondents no.1 and 2 denied that the alleged accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of Respondent no.1. Respondents no.1 and 2 contended that, the accident occurred due to rash and negligent act of the claimant in driving the motorcycle. Respondents no.1 and 2 further contended that, at the time of accident, Tata Indica Car bearing No.MH­20­AG­5613 was having valid insurance policy for the period between 31.3.2014 to 30.3.2015 and respondent no.1 was having valid driving license. Respondents no.1 and 2 further submitted that, the claim amount is exorbitant and excessive. Respondents no.1 and 2 lastly prayed for dismissal of claim petition. 6]Respondent no.3 New India Assurance Company Limited filed its written statement vide Exh.14 and opposed the claim of claimant. Respondent no.3 denied that the alleged accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of Respondent no.1. Respondent 4 [MACP No.446/2015 [J] no.3 further contended that, offending vehicle of respondent no.1 was not having fitness certificate and thus, there is breach of terms of insurance policy in between respondents no.2 and 3. Respondent no.3 further contended that, claimant drove his motorcycle in rash and negligent manner and gave dash to the car of respondent no.2. Respondent no.3 further contended that, the claimant has not made party to the insurance company of motorcycle driven by him and therefore, the claim petition is liable to be dismissed for want of joinder of necessary party. The insurance company further submitted that, the claim amount is exorbitant and excessive. The Insurance Company lastly prayed for dismissal of claim petition. 7]On the basis of above pleadings of the parties, the then Member, MACT framed the following Issues at Exh.21. So I reword said Issues as under: SR. No. ISSUES 1Whether the claimant proves that, he has sustained injury and thereby caused permanent disability in the accident occurred on 23.12.2014 at about 7­30 p.m. due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle i.e. Car bearing registration No.MH20­AG­5613 ? 2Does the petitioner prove that, the said accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of driver of offending vehicle respondent no.1 and owned by respondent no.2 and insured by respondent no.3 ? 3Whether petitioner is entitled for compensation, If yest, 5 [MACP No.446/2015 [J] what is just and rerasonable amount of compensation and against whom it is to be awarded ? 4What order and award ? My findings to the above issues for the reasons stated below are as under: Findings 1.Affirmative. 2. Affirmative. 3.Yes, Rs.50,000/­ along with interest @ 9% p.a. from respondent no.1 to 3 jointly and severally. 4. As per final order. REASONS AS TO ISSUES NO.1 TO 4 : 8]In order to prove the claim, applicant Shaikh Nasir deposed as PW­1 vide Exh.22. He has also examined PW­2 Dr.Parmeshwar Shivlal Jaiswal vide Exh­36, Orthopedic Surgeon, who issued Permanent Disability Certificate as per Exh.37 and filed copies of FIR as per Exh­25, Charge Sheet Exh­26, Statement of complainant Nasir Exh­27, Spot Panchanama Exh­28, Driving License of respondent no.1 Eknath Abarao Khosre Exh­29, Registration Certificate of Car bearing registration No.MH­20­AG­5613 belonging to Dadabhau Haribhau Kadam i.e. respondent no.2 vide Exh­30, Insurance Cover Note of offending vehicle vide Exh­31, Shop License 6 [MACP No.446/2015 [J] under the Bombay Shops & Establishment Act in the name of claimant Sk.Nasir Sk.Kabir Exh­32, Form Comp. 'AA' Exh­33, Injury Certificate issued by MGM Hospital, Aurangabad and Medicine Purchase Bills vide Exh­38 and 42/1 to 42/5. Claimant filed Evidence Close Pursis Exh­43 and thereby closed his side. Respondents no.1 and 2 did not adduce evidence in support of their contentions. Respondent no.3 Insurance Company filed Evidence Close Pursis Exh­44. 9]On perusal of the deposition of PW­1 Sk.NAsir along with Police paper i.e. FIR Exh.25, Charge Sheet Exh­26, Spot Panchanama Exh.27 and Form Comp. 'AA' Exh33, it reveals that, offending Car bearing No. MH­20­AG­5613 gave dash to the claimant. In fact, claimant Sk. Nasir is victim of alleged incident. The contents of FIR and Spot Panchanama clearly point out towards negligence on the part of driver of Car bearing No. MH­20­AG­5613 i.e. respondent no.1. PW­2 Dr.PArmeshwar Jaiswal deposed vide Exh­ 36 that, he examined claimant and issued Disability Certificate Exh­ 37. According to him, claimant has sustained 15% permanent disability. 10]Although respondents no.1 to 3 have contended in Written Statement Exh­14 and 19 that TATA Indica Car bearing No. MH­20­AG­5613 was not driven at high speed and in rash and 7 [MACP No.446/2015 [J] negligent manner, but not adduced evidence to substantiate the said contention. I must, therefore, hold that the accident in question was caused solely on account of the rash and negligent driving of the car in question by its driver i.e. respondent no.1 Eknath Abarao Khosre. 11]The copy of Insurance Cover Note of TATA Indica Car bearing No. MH­20­AG­5613 filed on record Exh.31 shows, the car is standing in the name of respondent no.2 Dadabhau Haribhau Kadam and it is insured with respondent no.3 The New India Assurance Company Limited for the period from 31.3.2014 to 30.3.2015. Police paper i.e. FIR Exh­25 and Spot Panchanama Exh.28 filed on record show, alleged accident took place on 23.12.2014. Admittedly, on the day of alleged accident the car was insured with respondent no.3 Insurance Company. 12]In main petition Exh.1 applicant has pleaded that after alleged accident, he took medical treatment at MGM Hospital, Aurangabad from 23.12.2014 to 24.12.2014 as indoor patient. In order to prove the same, applicant Sk.Nasir has deposed in his affidavit Exh.22 as per pleading in main petition. He has also filed Injury Certificate vide Exh­38 and Medicines Purchase Receipts as per Exh­42/1 to 42/5 showing, he paid near about Rs.1,600/­ to purchase medicines. Injury Certificate Exh­38 shows reference of fracture injury to his right foot. So, from the all above aspects, it is 8 [MACP No.446/2015 [J] clear that, in the alleged accident, claimant has sustained grievious injury. Therefore, apart from hospital bill, he is entitled to claim amount paid by him to purchase medicines i.e. Rs.1,600/­ as rounded off Rs.2,000/­. No doubt, the hospital bill is not filed on record or claimant has not examined any witness to that effect. However, it does not mean that, without paying single pie, medical treatment was provided to him. So, the issue of hospital bill will be considered while awarding compensation under other heads i.e. pain and agony etc., 13]Learned advocate for claimant submitted that applicant has sustained permanent disability due to injury sustained in alleged accident. In order to prove the said permanent disability, applicant has examined PW­2 Dr.Parmeshwar Jaiswal vide Exh­36 who medically examined applicant on 12.1.2017 and issued Disability Certificate vide Exh.37. As per reference in the said Disability Certificate, applicant Sk.Nasir sustained in all 15% permanent disability. In such circumstances, according to me, only production of Disability Certificate Exh.37 and examining PW­2 Dr.Parmeshwar Jaiswal who is not part of providing medical aid to Sk.Nisar is not sufficient to claim compensation for loss of future income. It must be proved by medical evidence that there is a functional disability which occurred due to permanent disability and which ultimately resulted 9 [MACP No.446/2015 [J] in loss of earning capacity. So it cannot be said that, applicant Sk.Nisar has lost earning capacity. In such circumstances, applicant Sk.Nisar is not entitled to get compensation on account of loss of earning capacity. 14]In short, in the light of above aspects, according to me, the applicant is not entitled to claim amount only on the basis of permanent Disability Certificate like Exh­37 as discussed above. However, considering contents in the FIR, Spot Panchanama, Form Comp.'AA' as well as main petition and affidavit of claimant, we can not ignore the fact of alleged accident. Therefore, considering the age of claimant, according to me, he is justified in getting an amount of Rs.20,000/­ towards pains and agony. Moreover, an amount of Rs.10,000/­ is just and proper towards loss of future happiness and an amount of Rs.10,000/­ is just and proper to loss of shortening of life span. Similarly, applicant is justified in getting an amount of Rs.5,000/­ towards special diet. Moreover, applicant was required to visit the hospital from time to time for treatment. So an amount of Rs.3,000/­ is just and proper towards transportation charges. 15]Thus, petitioner Sk.Nisar is entitled to get net compensation of Rs.50,000 ( Rupees Fifty thousand ). Admittedly, car involved in accident is driven by respondent no.1 and owned by respondent no.2 at the time of accident. So respondent no.1 to 3 are 10 [MACP No.446/2015 [J] jointly and severally liable to pay compensation of Rs.50,000/­ (Rupees Fifty thousand only) to applicant Sk.Nisar along with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till realization of entire amount of compensation. Hence, I answer Issues no. 1 to 3 accordingly and in answer to Issue No.4, pass following order: ORDER 1.Application is partly allowed with cost. 2.Respondents no.1 to 3 shall jointly and/or severally pay sum of Rs.50,000/­(Rupees Fifty thousand only) inclusive of the NFL, to the applicant along with interest @ 9% p.a from the date of filing of the petition till realization of the amount. 4.Respondents no.1 to 3 are further directed to issue A/c payee cheque in the name of applicant Shaikh Nasir Shaikh Khabir as above by depositing the same in the Tribunal. 5.The Account officer/Nazir is directed to handover cheque to the applicant by obtaining acknowledgment thereof. 6. An award shall be drawn up accordingly. Dictated & pronounced in open court. Sd/­ Dated:27.08.2018 .

CLAIM:U nder Section 166 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 for compensation of Rs. 2,00,000 /­. ********************************************************** Shri Mohsin Kazi ­ Advocate for the claimant. Shri F. R. Shaikh ­ Advocate for respondents No. 1 and 2. ********************************************************** ­­2­­ MACP No. 127/2015 (Judgment) J U D G M E N T (Delivered on 14th Day of July, 2016) Present petition is filed by the claimant for getting compensation from respondents as per Section 166 of Motor Vehicle's Act. 02] It is the case of the claimant that on 20.04.2014 he was travelling by bus bearing No. MH­20­BL­1830 from Khamgaon to Chikhali when the said bus is rash and negligent and in high speed. Due to which the bus turned turtle and the accident took place. Because of the said accident claimant sustained serious injuries on several parts of the body. He was shifted to Civil Hospital at Akola and thereafter shifted to Korde General Hospital at Akola. The medical treatment was given to the claimant in the said Hospital from 20­04­2014 to 25­04­2014 as indoor patient. The relative of the claimant incurred the amount of Rs. 1,00,000/­ for medical treatment of the injured claimant such as hospitalization charges, doctor's fees etc. After the accident, complaint was filed against the opponent No.2 and the crime was registered against him under section 279, 337 and 338 of Indian Penal Code. At the time of accident claimant was 29 years of age. Due to accidental injuries, he sustained permanent disablement and is unable to do daily work. He sustained shock and pain and lost amenities. Due to disablement he is dependent on others. He is still not recovered from the accidental injuries and his medical ­­3­­ MACP No. 127/2015 (Judgment) treatment is still going on. Before the accident he was self­ employed doctor and was getting income of Rs. 20,000/­ per month. He was maintaining himself and his family. Respondent No. 1 is M.S.R.T.C. who is owner of the said bus and respondent No.2 was driver of the said bus at the time of the accident. Therefore, the claimant is praying for directing respondents No. 1 and 2 to pay compensation of Rs. 2,00,000/­ to him. 03]Respondent No. 1 appeared and filed W.S. at Exh. 19. Respondent No. 2 appeared and filed W.S. at Exh.16. It is contended by the respondent No. 1 that the contents of claim petition are false and incorrect. It is denied that the bus driver drove his bus in rash and negligent manner and in high speed. It is also denied that the claimant suffered permanent disability because of the accident. Age and income of the claimant is also denied by respondents. While respondent No. 2 also denied the contents of the petition. It is admitted that, he was driver on the said bus and under control and supervision of respondent No.1. It is contended that he was driving the S.T. Bus at the time of accident by observing all traffic rules and with moderate speed. It is further contended that the claimant has not filed any documentary proof about his income or about permanent disability. It is further contended that, the respondent is not at all responsible for alleged accident. It is further contended that, respondent No. 1 is the owner and insurer of the S.T. Bus. Hence, in case if the Court comes to the conclusion claimant is entitled for compensation then liability to pay the same may be shifted to ­­4­­ MACP No. 127/2015 (Judgment) respondent No.1. As such he prayed for rejecting the petition. 04]Following issues were framed by my predecessor and I have recorded their findings for the reasons discussed below :­ ISSUES FINDINGS 1]Whether the claimant proves that on 20.04.2014 at about 04.00 a.m. on Khamgaon to Chikli within the jurisdiction of Khamgaon Police Station, District Buldhana an accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of S.T.Bus bearing Registration No.MH­20­BL­1830 by its owner i.e. Respondent No. 1 and driver i.e. Respondent No.2 ?In the affirmative. 2]Whether the claimant proves that she sustained permanent disability in the alleged accident ? In the negative. 3]Whether the claimant is entitled to get compensation? If yes, what should be quantum of compensation ? Rs. 50,000/­ against respondents No. 1 and 2 4]What should be rate of interest ? @ Rs. 9 % per annum 5]What order ? Petition is allowed. R E A S O N S AS TO ISSUE NO.1 : ­ 05]It is the case of the claimant that on 20.04.2014 at ­­5­­ MACP No. 127/2015 (Judgment) about 4. a.m. accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.2 who was driving bus bearing No. MH­20­BL­ 1830 owned by respondent No.1. For support of this case, the claimant examined himself on oath. He deposed that while he was travelling on 20.04.2014 by the said bus from Khamgaon to Chikhali, accident occurred at about 4.00 a.m. due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.2. The claimant has also filed on record police papers including complaint. The said complaint was filed by one of the passenger who was travelling by the said bus. In the said complaint, it is mentioned that near Madhani Phata the bus turned turtle because of the rash and negligent driving of the driver. Respondents No.1 and 2 have not denied the fact of accident. It is only their case that it did not happen due to rash and negligent act of the driver. The police papers show that the accident occurred because of the rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. Hence, I found that claimant has proved that on 20.04.2014 at about 4.00 a.m. on Khamgaon to Chikhali road accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. Hence, I answer issue No. 1 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO.2 : ­ 06]It is the case of claimant that because of the said accident he suffered permanent disability. However, for support of this contention he deposed on oath and has also filed Disability Certificate issued by Dr. Sachin Bedmutha. The claimant has not examined the said doctor. It is the case of the claimant that after the accident he was shifted to Civil Hospital, Akola and thereafter ­­6­­ MACP No. 127/2015 (Judgment) shifted to Korde General Hospital and in the said Hospital operations were conducted over the injured. However, there is absolutely no documentary evidence for proof of this contentions. It is the case of the claimant that thereafter he was admitted in Korde General Hospital at Akola. He has filed the Discharge Card of the said Hospital. It is mentioned that, there was severe back pain with history of blunt trauma in S.T. Bus accident. In this Discharge Card there is no mention that any operation has been conducted with respect to the said patient. Even in the bill of the said Hospital no charges such as X­rays or operations were accepted from the claimant. The claimant has not examined any other witness such as Medical Officer or any Doctor in support of his case that there was any permanent disability sustained by him. The Disability Certificate is issued by one Private Doctor namely Sachin Bedmutha who has not examined by the claimant. In the cross­examination the claimant deposed that there was fracture injury on his backbone, shoulder and hand. But there is absolutely no document showing any such injury. In the evidence he has not deposed anything about any other disability. Advocate of the claimant and advocate of respondents filed on record one pursis contending that the disability of the claimant be held as 7.5 %. Even though it is so, without proof of any such permanent disability it cannot be considered that in fact the permanent disability of the claimant is 7.5 % relied on the joint pursis filed by the advocate of the claimant and advocate for respondents. I have already discussed that, the claimant has failed to prove any such permanent disability. Hence, I answer issue No.2 in the negative. ­­7­­ MACP No. 127/2015 (Judgment) AS TO ISSUES NO. 3, 4 AND 5 :­ 07]I have already discussed that the claimant has proved that he met with an accident on 20.04.2014 at about 4.00 a.m. on Khamgaon to Chikhali road because of the rash and negligent driving of respondent No.2. I have also discussed that the claimant has failed to prove that he has sustained permanent disability in the accident. So also even if it is presumed for the sake of arguments that there was permanent disability to the claimant because of the accident, it was necessary for the claimant to prove that due to said disability there is loss in his earning capacity. The claimant has deposed in his cross­examination that he will file reports about his M.R.I. Tests and about the alleged treatment taken by him by Dr.Bedmutha. But he has filed it on record any single paper regarding the same and so the adverse inference has to be drawn against the claimant. In his cross­examination he has deposed that, his educational qualification is B. H. M. S. but he has not produced on record any Degree Certificate nor he has produced on record any document about his registration as a Doctor. On the contrary he deposed that, he is running 'Shifa Clinic' at Padegaon. As such it is clear that, there is no loss of earning capacity to the present claim. Hence, there is no point in considering the age and the percentage of his alleged disability. But he has proved that, he met with an accident because of the rash and negligent driving of respondent No.2 and so he is entitled to get compensation for pain and suffering etc. ­­8­­ MACP No. 127/2015 (Judgment) 08]Advocate for the claimant relied on the case of Shaikh Farooq Mohammad Gaouse Vs. Transport Manager, Thane Municipal Transport Undertaking reported in 2013 (2) T.A.C. Page 404 (Bom.) In this case the injured was aged about 33 years and he suffered multiple fracture to his ribs, spinal cord, burst compression and permanent disability. It was held that there was 100 % loss of earning capacity and injured deprived of pleasures of matrimonial life ­ Bills produced on record were also considered and the compensation for future expenditure was also awarded. Certain amount was granted for future medical treatment. But in the present case, I have already discussed that the claimant has failed to prove the permanent disability. He has filed on record certain medical bills and the advocate for claimant also relied on the same case for the point that the claimant was not expected to maintain account in minute details of the amount spent on the purchase of medicines and other equipments. Hence, amount of bills produced on record was granted to him. It was also considered that he will have to spend medicines in future. As per the case of the claimant himself the accident occurred on 20.04.2014. But the medical bills which are produced by him of Ajwa Medicals are for the period of August 2014 to February 2015. I have already discussed that, the claimant has failed to examine the Doctor who has treated him. He was the best available witness to the claimant for the proof that, he requires future medical treatment. But no such evidence is brought on record by the claimant. Hence, I found that those medical bills cannot be considered. ­­9­­ MACP No. 127/2015 (Judgment) 09]Advocate of the claimant is also relied on the case of Syed Sadiq and others Versus Divisional Manager, United India Insurance Co.Ltd. reported in 2014 A.C. 365 (SC) . He submitted that, in this case the income of the injured was held as Rs. 6,500/­ per month by Hon'ble Apex Court, even though the injured was vegetable vendor. He further argued that, the claimant is having qualification of B.H.M.S. and so his monthly income has to be considered as Rs. 8,000/­ to 9,000/­. I have already discussed that the claimant has failed to prove that there is any loss of his earning capacity. He has not filed on record any documentary proof regarding his practice or his educational qualification. Therefore there is no question of considering his income. Hence with due respect to the views held by their Lordships of Hon'ble Supreme Court and Hon'ble High Court in the above mentioned cases, I found that those are not applicable to the present case. 10] I have already discussed that claimant has proved that he has suffered pain in the accident which occurred because of the rash and negligent driving of respondent No.2 I found that he is entitled for the pain and sufferings. Hence, I found that he is entitled for amount of Rs. 25,000/­ as he was admitted in the Hospital from 20.04.2014 to 24.04.2014. It can be considered that, in that case he might have purchased medicines for his treatment of about Rs. 10,000/­. As per the Discharge Card he was admitted for the reason of severe back pain and also of head. He ­­10­­ MACP No. 127/2015 (Judgment) must have paid for attendants charges. Hence, I found that he is entitled for the amount of Rs.10,000/­ for attendants charges. He is also entitled for Rs. 5,000/­ for litigation expenses. In the result, I found that he is entitled for the total amount of Rs. 50,000/­. 11]Respondent No. 2 has admitted that he was driving the said bus at the time of said accident and respondent No. 1 i.e. M.S.R.T.C. is owner of the said bus. Hence, I found that respondents No. 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay the said amount. Hence I answer issues No. 3, 4 and 5 accordingly. In the result, I pass the following order : ORDER 01]Petition is hereby partly allowed. 02]Reaspondents No. 1 and 2 do pay jointly and severally compensation amount of Rs. 50,000/­ ( Rupees Fifty Thousand only ) including NFL amount to the claimant alongwith interest at the rate of Rs. 9 % per annum from the date of filing of petition till realization. 03]Respondents do pay costs of the petition to claimant and shall bear their own costs. 04]Award be drawn accordingly. sd/­ Date : 14­07­2016.

CLAIM:U nder Section 166 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 for compensation of Rs. 2,00,000 /­. ********************************************************** Shri Mohsin Kazi ­ Advocate for the claimant. Shri F. R. Shaikh ­ Advocate for respondents No. 1 and 2. ********************************************************** ­­2­­ MACP No. 127/2015 (Judgment) J U D G M E N T (Delivered on 14th Day of July, 2016) Present petition is filed by the claimant for getting compensation from respondents as per Section 166 of Motor Vehicle's Act. 02] It is the case of the claimant that on 20.04.2014 he was travelling by bus bearing No. MH­20­BL­1830 from Khamgaon to Chikhali when the said bus is rash and negligent and in high speed. Due to which the bus turned turtle and the accident took place. Because of the said accident claimant sustained serious injuries on several parts of the body. He was shifted to Civil Hospital at Akola and thereafter shifted to Korde General Hospital at Akola. The medical treatment was given to the claimant in the said Hospital from 20­04­2014 to 25­04­2014 as indoor patient. The relative of the claimant incurred the amount of Rs. 1,00,000/­ for medical treatment of the injured claimant such as hospitalization charges, doctor's fees etc. After the accident, complaint was filed against the opponent No.2 and the crime was registered against him under section 279, 337 and 338 of Indian Penal Code. At the time of accident claimant was 29 years of age. Due to accidental injuries, he sustained permanent disablement and is unable to do daily work. He sustained shock and pain and lost amenities. Due to disablement he is dependent on others. He is still not recovered from the accidental injuries and his medical ­­3­­ MACP No. 127/2015 (Judgment) treatment is still going on. Before the accident he was self­ employed doctor and was getting income of Rs. 20,000/­ per month. He was maintaining himself and his family. Respondent No. 1 is M.S.R.T.C. who is owner of the said bus and respondent No.2 was driver of the said bus at the time of the accident. Therefore, the claimant is praying for directing respondents No. 1 and 2 to pay compensation of Rs. 2,00,000/­ to him. 03]Respondent No. 1 appeared and filed W.S. at Exh. 19. Respondent No. 2 appeared and filed W.S. at Exh.16. It is contended by the respondent No. 1 that the contents of claim petition are false and incorrect. It is denied that the bus driver drove his bus in rash and negligent manner and in high speed. It is also denied that the claimant suffered permanent disability because of the accident. Age and income of the claimant is also denied by respondents. While respondent No. 2 also denied the contents of the petition. It is admitted that, he was driver on the said bus and under control and supervision of respondent No.1. It is contended that he was driving the S.T. Bus at the time of accident by observing all traffic rules and with moderate speed. It is further contended that the claimant has not filed any documentary proof about his income or about permanent disability. It is further contended that, the respondent is not at all responsible for alleged accident. It is further contended that, respondent No. 1 is the owner and insurer of the S.T. Bus. Hence, in case if the Court comes to the conclusion claimant is entitled for compensation then liability to pay the same may be shifted to ­­4­­ MACP No. 127/2015 (Judgment) respondent No.1. As such he prayed for rejecting the petition. 04]Following issues were framed by my predecessor and I have recorded their findings for the reasons discussed below :­ ISSUES FINDINGS 1]Whether the claimant proves that on 20.04.2014 at about 04.00 a.m. on Khamgaon to Chikli within the jurisdiction of Khamgaon Police Station, District Buldhana an accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of S.T.Bus bearing Registration No.MH­20­BL­1830 by its owner i.e. Respondent No. 1 and driver i.e. Respondent No.2 ?In the affirmative. 2]Whether the claimant proves that she sustained permanent disability in the alleged accident ? In the negative. 3]Whether the claimant is entitled to get compensation? If yes, what should be quantum of compensation ? Rs. 50,000/­ against respondents No. 1 and 2 4]What should be rate of interest ? @ Rs. 9 % per annum 5]What order ? Petition is allowed. R E A S O N S AS TO ISSUE NO.1 : ­ 05]It is the case of the claimant that on 20.04.2014 at ­­5­­ MACP No. 127/2015 (Judgment) about 4. a.m. accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.2 who was driving bus bearing No. MH­20­BL­ 1830 owned by respondent No.1. For support of this case, the claimant examined himself on oath. He deposed that while he was travelling on 20.04.2014 by the said bus from Khamgaon to Chikhali, accident occurred at about 4.00 a.m. due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.2. The claimant has also filed on record police papers including complaint. The said complaint was filed by one of the passenger who was travelling by the said bus. In the said complaint, it is mentioned that near Madhani Phata the bus turned turtle because of the rash and negligent driving of the driver. Respondents No.1 and 2 have not denied the fact of accident. It is only their case that it did not happen due to rash and negligent act of the driver. The police papers show that the accident occurred because of the rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. Hence, I found that claimant has proved that on 20.04.2014 at about 4.00 a.m. on Khamgaon to Chikhali road accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. Hence, I answer issue No. 1 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO.2 : ­ 06]It is the case of claimant that because of the said accident he suffered permanent disability. However, for support of this contention he deposed on oath and has also filed Disability Certificate issued by Dr. Sachin Bedmutha. The claimant has not examined the said doctor. It is the case of the claimant that after the accident he was shifted to Civil Hospital, Akola and thereafter ­­6­­ MACP No. 127/2015 (Judgment) shifted to Korde General Hospital and in the said Hospital operations were conducted over the injured. However, there is absolutely no documentary evidence for proof of this contentions. It is the case of the claimant that thereafter he was admitted in Korde General Hospital at Akola. He has filed the Discharge Card of the said Hospital. It is mentioned that, there was severe back pain with history of blunt trauma in S.T. Bus accident. In this Discharge Card there is no mention that any operation has been conducted with respect to the said patient. Even in the bill of the said Hospital no charges such as X­rays or operations were accepted from the claimant. The claimant has not examined any other witness such as Medical Officer or any Doctor in support of his case that there was any permanent disability sustained by him. The Disability Certificate is issued by one Private Doctor namely Sachin Bedmutha who has not examined by the claimant. In the cross­examination the claimant deposed that there was fracture injury on his backbone, shoulder and hand. But there is absolutely no document showing any such injury. In the evidence he has not deposed anything about any other disability. Advocate of the claimant and advocate of respondents filed on record one pursis contending that the disability of the claimant be held as 7.5 %. Even though it is so, without proof of any such permanent disability it cannot be considered that in fact the permanent disability of the claimant is 7.5 % relied on the joint pursis filed by the advocate of the claimant and advocate for respondents. I have already discussed that, the claimant has failed to prove any such permanent disability. Hence, I answer issue No.2 in the negative. ­­7­­ MACP No. 127/2015 (Judgment) AS TO ISSUES NO. 3, 4 AND 5 :­ 07]I have already discussed that the claimant has proved that he met with an accident on 20.04.2014 at about 4.00 a.m. on Khamgaon to Chikhali road because of the rash and negligent driving of respondent No.2. I have also discussed that the claimant has failed to prove that he has sustained permanent disability in the accident. So also even if it is presumed for the sake of arguments that there was permanent disability to the claimant because of the accident, it was necessary for the claimant to prove that due to said disability there is loss in his earning capacity. The claimant has deposed in his cross­examination that he will file reports about his M.R.I. Tests and about the alleged treatment taken by him by Dr.Bedmutha. But he has filed it on record any single paper regarding the same and so the adverse inference has to be drawn against the claimant. In his cross­examination he has deposed that, his educational qualification is B. H. M. S. but he has not produced on record any Degree Certificate nor he has produced on record any document about his registration as a Doctor. On the contrary he deposed that, he is running 'Shifa Clinic' at Padegaon. As such it is clear that, there is no loss of earning capacity to the present claim. Hence, there is no point in considering the age and the percentage of his alleged disability. But he has proved that, he met with an accident because of the rash and negligent driving of respondent No.2 and so he is entitled to get compensation for pain and suffering etc. ­­8­­ MACP No. 127/2015 (Judgment) 08]Advocate for the claimant relied on the case of Shaikh Farooq Mohammad Gaouse Vs. Transport Manager, Thane Municipal Transport Undertaking reported in 2013 (2) T.A.C. Page 404 (Bom.) In this case the injured was aged about 33 years and he suffered multiple fracture to his ribs, spinal cord, burst compression and permanent disability. It was held that there was 100 % loss of earning capacity and injured deprived of pleasures of matrimonial life ­ Bills produced on record were also considered and the compensation for future expenditure was also awarded. Certain amount was granted for future medical treatment. But in the present case, I have already discussed that the claimant has failed to prove the permanent disability. He has filed on record certain medical bills and the advocate for claimant also relied on the same case for the point that the claimant was not expected to maintain account in minute details of the amount spent on the purchase of medicines and other equipments. Hence, amount of bills produced on record was granted to him. It was also considered that he will have to spend medicines in future. As per the case of the claimant himself the accident occurred on 20.04.2014. But the medical bills which are produced by him of Ajwa Medicals are for the period of August 2014 to February 2015. I have already discussed that, the claimant has failed to examine the Doctor who has treated him. He was the best available witness to the claimant for the proof that, he requires future medical treatment. But no such evidence is brought on record by the claimant. Hence, I found that those medical bills cannot be considered. ­­9­­ MACP No. 127/2015 (Judgment) 09]Advocate of the claimant is also relied on the case of Syed Sadiq and others Versus Divisional Manager, United India Insurance Co.Ltd. reported in 2014 A.C. 365 (SC) . He submitted that, in this case the income of the injured was held as Rs. 6,500/­ per month by Hon'ble Apex Court, even though the injured was vegetable vendor. He further argued that, the claimant is having qualification of B.H.M.S. and so his monthly income has to be considered as Rs. 8,000/­ to 9,000/­. I have already discussed that the claimant has failed to prove that there is any loss of his earning capacity. He has not filed on record any documentary proof regarding his practice or his educational qualification. Therefore there is no question of considering his income. Hence with due respect to the views held by their Lordships of Hon'ble Supreme Court and Hon'ble High Court in the above mentioned cases, I found that those are not applicable to the present case. 10] I have already discussed that claimant has proved that he has suffered pain in the accident which occurred because of the rash and negligent driving of respondent No.2 I found that he is entitled for the pain and sufferings. Hence, I found that he is entitled for amount of Rs. 25,000/­ as he was admitted in the Hospital from 20.04.2014 to 24.04.2014. It can be considered that, in that case he might have purchased medicines for his treatment of about Rs. 10,000/­. As per the Discharge Card he was admitted for the reason of severe back pain and also of head. He ­­10­­ MACP No. 127/2015 (Judgment) must have paid for attendants charges. Hence, I found that he is entitled for the amount of Rs.10,000/­ for attendants charges. He is also entitled for Rs. 5,000/­ for litigation expenses. In the result, I found that he is entitled for the total amount of Rs. 50,000/­. 11]Respondent No. 2 has admitted that he was driving the said bus at the time of said accident and respondent No. 1 i.e. M.S.R.T.C. is owner of the said bus. Hence, I found that respondents No. 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay the said amount. Hence I answer issues No. 3, 4 and 5 accordingly. In the result, I pass the following order : ORDER 01]Petition is hereby partly allowed. 02]Reaspondents No. 1 and 2 do pay jointly and severally compensation amount of Rs. 50,000/­ ( Rupees Fifty Thousand only ) including NFL amount to the claimant alongwith interest at the rate of Rs. 9 % per annum from the date of filing of petition till realization. 03]Respondents do pay costs of the petition to claimant and shall bear their own costs. 04]Award be drawn accordingly. sd/­ Date : 14­07­2016.

Jadhav – Advocate for claimant Mr.F.R. Shaikh – Advocate for Respondents ************************************** J U D G M E N T [Delivered on this 7th day of October, 2017] 2 1]The claimant has filed this claim petition under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act for compensation amount of Rs.1,50,000/­. 2]In short, the claimant's case can be summarized as follows :­ It is the case of the claimant that, victim / injured Sunil Karbhari Malkar, aged about 17 years was traveling by ST bus bearing No. MH­14­BT­1173 on dated 19.11.2014. On that day when the said ST bus was on Pune – Bangalore highway near Mahadik petrol pump at about 21.15 hours at village Nerle District Sangli, that time the driver of the offending vehicle – Respondent No.1 driven the said ST bus in a rash and negligent manner. At that time Respondent No.1 – driver of the offending bus, gave dash to one Truck / Container which was ahead to the bus. That time the claimant / injured Sunil Karbhari Malkar had lost his four teeth / broken. Therefore, he was admitted in Loknete Rajarambapu Patil Hospital and Research Center at Urun­Islampur Taluka Walwa District Sangli, where he was admited from 19.11.2014 to 2011.2014. Sunil Vs. Uttam & anr. 3 Judgment – MACP No.325/2015 3]Police authority of police station Kasegaon registered a crime bearing No. I­54/2014 on dated 23.11.2014 against Respondent No.1 – Uttam Jagannath Jadhav ­ driver of ST bus of the offence under section 279, 337, 338 and 427 of the IPC. 4]Due to the said injuries, injured lost his four teeth claimant / injured incurred the expenses at about Rs.20,000/­ towards hospital and medical bills. As such claimant is permanently disabled due to broken of tooth and fracture of upper jaw. Hence, claimant required near about Rs.75,000/­ for fixing the artificial tooth and for treatment and expenses in future. Due to this the claimant had lost his opportunity to join in Defence service. 5]Further, claimant is unable to eat food daily properly and therefore, he could not maintain his health, he could not eat the hard food. As such claimant has claimed Rs.1,00,000/­ for pain and suffering and disabilities caused to the body and compensation of Rs.50,000/­ towards future medical treatment and expenses and also entitled for Rs.1,00,000/­ for fixing the artificial tooth and hospital bills. 4 6]The accident was caused due to the rash and negligent driving of driver of the offending vehicle ­ Respondent No.1. Respondent no.2 being the employer of Respondent No.1, they both are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation of Rs.2,50,000/­ to the claimant. However, claimant has restricted his claim for an amount of Rs.1,50,000/­ as he is not in a position to pay the court fees. Lastly, the claimant submitted to allow the claim as against both the respondents directing them to pay compensation of Rs.1,50,000/­ with 9% interest from the date of filing of this petition till its full and final realization. 7]In response to the claim petition of the petitioner, both the respondents have filed their written statement vide exh.17 and 13 respectively. Both the respondents have denied about the rash and negligent driving at the hands of Respondent No.1 and had also denied the claim of the claim petition about the pament of compensation. Further, denied about age of the claimant. It is contended by both the respondents that, the claim petition is not maintainable. According to them, the claim petition is false and it is about excessive, exorbitant compensation amount. Sunil Vs. Uttam & anr. 5 Judgment – MACP No.325/2015 Further, they contended that, Respondent No.1 was not at fault while driving the said ST bus. They further contended that, the unknown vehicle had suddenly applied the break and stopped on the road therefore, driver of unknown vehicle is responsible for the accident. Respondents also denied about the entire claim and lastly submitted to dismiss the claim petition. 8]Considering the pleading of both sides and rival contentions, I have framed the issues vide exh.18, those are being reproduced as follows, and my findings thereon with reasons are as follows :­ ISSUES FINDINGS 1]Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the motor vehicle bearing registration No. MH­ 14­BT­1173 driven by respondent no.1 ?In the affirmative. 2]Whether the claimant sustained permanent disability due to the injuries suffered by him in the said accident ? If yes, to what extent ? No. 3]Whether the claimant is entitled to get compensation amount ? If yes, to what extent ? Yes, Rs.30,000/­ only. 4]Who is liable to pay compensation ? As per final order . 5]What order and award ? As per final order. 6 R E A S O N S 9]Heard argument of learned counsel Mr.P.R. Jadhav for the claimant and learned counsel Mr.F.R. Shaikh for respondents at length. Perused the record and proceeding carefully. 10]In order to establish and prove the claim, the claimant has led his oral evidence at exh.21 and also relied on the documents i.e. a true copy of FIR vide exh.24, a true copy of complaint of complainant PHC Vijay Vishnu Patil vide exh.25, a true copy of statement of witness Manik Tukaram Gatte vide exh.26, a true copy of spot panchanama vide exh.27, a true copy of inspection report about the offending vehicle bus no. MH­14­BT­ 1173 vide exh.28, a true copy of driving licence of respondent no.1 Uttam Jadhav vide exh.29 and a true copy of injury certificate issued by Dr.Subhash Sachin Pawar of Loknete Rajaram Bapu Patil Hospital, Islampur vide exh.30. 11]Claimant further failed to lead evidence despite given sufficient time hence, evidence of the claimant is closed vide order below exh.1. Moreover, Respondents side have closed their evidence vide purshis exh.31 without leading any evidence. Sunil Vs. Uttam & anr. 7 Judgment – MACP No.325/2015 AS TO ISSUE NO.1 :­ 12]In the instant case, no doubt, the accident had occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the driver of the offending ST bus – Respondent No.1 and said offending ST bus was owned by Respondent No.2. 13]In the oral evidence of CW1 Sunil Karbhari Malkar at exh.21 deposed that, the accident has occurred on 19.11.2014 when he was proceeding to Islampur District Sangli from Pune by ST Bus bearing No. MH­14­BT­1173. That bus was being driven by Respondent No.1 Uttam Jadhav in a rash and negligent manner and gave dash to unknown motor vehicle – Container from its back side. As such accident occurred. In his oral evidence he further deposed that, he sustained injury to his mouth and his four upper teeth were uprooted. As such he was admitted to Loknete Rajaram Bapu Patil Hospital and Research Center at Urun­Islampur. He was admitted in that hospital till 20.11.2014. 14]According to CW1 Sunil Karbharni Malkar, police has drawn the spot panchanama, FIR was lodged as against Respondent No.1 and Respondent No.1 was prosecuted by the 8 police authority of police station Kasegaon. According to him as deposed by him, he lost opportunity of service in Defence and he has 100% functional disability. 15]CW1 Sunil Karbhari Malkar further deposed that, he had incurred Rs.40,000/­ for fixing artificial teeth. As such he claimed Rs.2,00,000/­ towards compensation with 9% interest from the respondents. 16]From perusal of copy of FIR at exh.24, complaint at exh.25, statement of witness Manik Tukaram Gatte at exh.26, spot panchanama at exh.27 and inspection report a bout the offending vehicle bus no. MH­14­BT­1173 issued by the police authority of police station Kasegaon, it goes to prove and establish that, the driver of offending ST bus was Respondent No.1 and the same was owned by Respondent No.1 and the accident had occurred due to rash and negligent driving of Respondent no.1 and claimant had sustained the injruy. 17]From these police case papers, it is well established that, Respondent No.1 Uttam Jagannath Jadhav was rash and Sunil Vs. Uttam & anr. 9 Judgment – MACP No.325/2015 negligent while driving his offending vehicle – ST Bus No. MH­14­ BT­1173 on the date of accident. As such issue no.1 is proved at all hence, I answer issue no.1 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NOS.2 TO 4 :­ 18]From the police case papers on record as well as oral evidence of claimant it is well established that, the claimant met with an accident. From the police case papers on record as aforesaid it reveals that, claimant Sunil Karbhari Malkar was admitted in Loknete Rajaram Bapu Patil Hospital and Research Center and in this regard the claimant has filed on record the injury certainly vide exh.30, in which it is mentioned that, he was admitted in that hospital on 19.11.2014 and discharged on 20.11.2014, wherein it is mentioned about the grievous injury and upper four incisor teeth broken. 19] In the instant case, certainly there is no proof or evidence about the permanent disability i.e. percentage of the permanent disability, as claimant failed to lead medical evidence on record. It appears that, the injured / claimant had lost four upper teeth. Furthermore, there is no documentary evidence about 10 the medical expenses incurred by him. Furthermore, there is no case of the claimant that, he was earning hand as claimed in the claim petition, it is shown as monthly income of the injured – not applicable. The claimant relied on the following rulings :­ 1}United India Insurance Company Limited Vs. Thomas – 1991 CJ(Ker) 362 2}Smt.Meena Devi and others Vs. Lahar Chand and others 2003(3) T.A.C. 461 (M.P.) I have gone through the aforesaid rulings and considered the same as guidelines for me. 20]In the circumstances it is not established that, the claimant has suffered permanent disability. However, certainly he met with an accident and sustained the injury i.e. four upper teeth were uprooted.

Jadhav – Advocate for claimant Mr.F.R. Shaikh – Advocate for Respondents ************************************** J U D G M E N T [Delivered on this 7th day of October, 2017] 2 1]The claimant has filed this claim petition under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act for compensation amount of Rs.1,50,000/­. 2]In short, the claimant's case can be summarized as follows :­ It is the case of the claimant that, victim / injured Sunil Karbhari Malkar, aged about 17 years was traveling by ST bus bearing No. MH­14­BT­1173 on dated 19.11.2014. On that day when the said ST bus was on Pune – Bangalore highway near Mahadik petrol pump at about 21.15 hours at village Nerle District Sangli, that time the driver of the offending vehicle – Respondent No.1 driven the said ST bus in a rash and negligent manner. At that time Respondent No.1 – driver of the offending bus, gave dash to one Truck / Container which was ahead to the bus. That time the claimant / injured Sunil Karbhari Malkar had lost his four teeth / broken. Therefore, he was admitted in Loknete Rajarambapu Patil Hospital and Research Center at Urun­Islampur Taluka Walwa District Sangli, where he was admited from 19.11.2014 to 2011.2014. Sunil Vs. Uttam & anr. 3 Judgment – MACP No.325/2015 3]Police authority of police station Kasegaon registered a crime bearing No. I­54/2014 on dated 23.11.2014 against Respondent No.1 – Uttam Jagannath Jadhav ­ driver of ST bus of the offence under section 279, 337, 338 and 427 of the IPC. 4]Due to the said injuries, injured lost his four teeth claimant / injured incurred the expenses at about Rs.20,000/­ towards hospital and medical bills. As such claimant is permanently disabled due to broken of tooth and fracture of upper jaw. Hence, claimant required near about Rs.75,000/­ for fixing the artificial tooth and for treatment and expenses in future. Due to this the claimant had lost his opportunity to join in Defence service. 5]Further, claimant is unable to eat food daily properly and therefore, he could not maintain his health, he could not eat the hard food. As such claimant has claimed Rs.1,00,000/­ for pain and suffering and disabilities caused to the body and compensation of Rs.50,000/­ towards future medical treatment and expenses and also entitled for Rs.1,00,000/­ for fixing the artificial tooth and hospital bills. 4 6]The accident was caused due to the rash and negligent driving of driver of the offending vehicle ­ Respondent No.1. Respondent no.2 being the employer of Respondent No.1, they both are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation of Rs.2,50,000/­ to the claimant. However, claimant has restricted his claim for an amount of Rs.1,50,000/­ as he is not in a position to pay the court fees. Lastly, the claimant submitted to allow the claim as against both the respondents directing them to pay compensation of Rs.1,50,000/­ with 9% interest from the date of filing of this petition till its full and final realization. 7]In response to the claim petition of the petitioner, both the respondents have filed their written statement vide exh.17 and 13 respectively. Both the respondents have denied about the rash and negligent driving at the hands of Respondent No.1 and had also denied the claim of the claim petition about the pament of compensation. Further, denied about age of the claimant. It is contended by both the respondents that, the claim petition is not maintainable. According to them, the claim petition is false and it is about excessive, exorbitant compensation amount. Sunil Vs. Uttam & anr. 5 Judgment – MACP No.325/2015 Further, they contended that, Respondent No.1 was not at fault while driving the said ST bus. They further contended that, the unknown vehicle had suddenly applied the break and stopped on the road therefore, driver of unknown vehicle is responsible for the accident. Respondents also denied about the entire claim and lastly submitted to dismiss the claim petition. 8]Considering the pleading of both sides and rival contentions, I have framed the issues vide exh.18, those are being reproduced as follows, and my findings thereon with reasons are as follows :­ ISSUES FINDINGS 1]Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the motor vehicle bearing registration No. MH­ 14­BT­1173 driven by respondent no.1 ?In the affirmative. 2]Whether the claimant sustained permanent disability due to the injuries suffered by him in the said accident ?

As per final order . 5]What order and award ? As per final order. 6 R E A S O N S 9]Heard argument of learned counsel Mr.P.R. Jadhav for the claimant and learned counsel Mr.F.R. Shaikh for respondents at length. Perused the record and proceeding carefully. 10]In order to establish and prove the claim, the claimant has led his oral evidence at exh.21 and also relied on the documents i.e. a true copy of FIR vide exh.24, a true copy of complaint of complainant PHC Vijay Vishnu Patil vide exh.25, a true copy of statement of witness Manik Tukaram Gatte vide exh.26, a true copy of spot panchanama vide exh.27, a true copy of inspection report about the offending vehicle bus no.

Moreover, Respondents side have closed their evidence vide purshis exh.31 without leading any evidence. Sunil Vs. Uttam & anr. 7 Judgment – MACP No.325/2015 AS TO ISSUE NO.1 :­ 12]In the instant case, no doubt, the accident had occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the driver of the offending ST bus – Respondent No.1 and said offending ST bus was owned by Respondent No.2. 13]In the oral evidence of CW1 Sunil Karbhari Malkar at exh.21 deposed that, the accident has occurred on 19.11.2014 when he was proceeding to Islampur District Sangli from Pune by ST Bus bearing No. MH­14­BT­1173. That bus was being driven by Respondent No.1 Uttam Jadhav in a rash and negligent manner and gave dash to unknown motor vehicle – Container from its back side. As such accident occurred. In his oral evidence he further deposed that, he sustained injury to his mouth and his four upper teeth were uprooted. As such he was admitted to Loknete Rajaram Bapu Patil Hospital and Research Center at Urun­Islampur. He was admitted in that hospital till 20.11.2014. 14]According to CW1 Sunil Karbharni Malkar, police has drawn the spot panchanama, FIR was lodged as against Respondent No.1 and Respondent No.1 was prosecuted by the 8 police authority of police station Kasegaon. According to him as deposed by him, he lost opportunity of service in Defence and he has 100% functional disability. 15]CW1 Sunil Karbhari Malkar further deposed that, he had incurred Rs.40,000/­ for fixing artificial teeth. As such he claimed Rs.2,00,000/­ towards compensation with 9% interest from the respondents. 16]From perusal of copy of FIR at exh.24, complaint at exh.25, statement of witness Manik Tukaram Gatte at exh.26, spot panchanama at exh.27 and inspection report a bout the offending vehicle bus no. MH­14­BT­1173 issued by the police authority of police station Kasegaon, it goes to prove and establish that, the driver of offending ST bus was Respondent No.1 and the same was owned by Respondent No.1 and the accident had occurred due to rash and negligent driving of Respondent no.1 and claimant had sustained the injruy. 17]From these police case papers, it is well established that, Respondent No.1 Uttam Jagannath Jadhav was rash and Sunil Vs. Uttam & anr. 9 Judgment – MACP No.325/2015 negligent while driving his offending vehicle – ST Bus No. MH­14­ BT­1173 on the date of accident. As such issue no.1 is proved at all hence, I answer issue no.1 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NOS.2 TO 4 :­ 18]From the police case papers on record as well as oral evidence of claimant it is well established that, the claimant met with an accident. From the police case papers on record as aforesaid it reveals that, claimant Sunil Karbhari Malkar was admitted in Loknete Rajaram Bapu Patil Hospital and Research Center and in this regard the claimant has filed on record the injury certainly vide exh.30, in which it is mentioned that, he was admitted in that hospital on 19.11.2014 and discharged on 20.11.2014, wherein it is mentioned about the grievous injury and upper four incisor teeth broken. 19] In the instant case, certainly there is no proof or evidence about the permanent disability i.e. percentage of the permanent disability, as claimant failed to lead medical evidence on record. It appears that, the injured / claimant had lost four upper teeth. Furthermore, there is no documentary evidence about 10 the medical expenses incurred by him. Furthermore, there is no case of the claimant that, he was earning hand as claimed in the claim petition, it is shown as monthly income of the injured – not applicable. The claimant relied on the following rulings :­ 1}United India Insurance Company Limited Vs. Thomas – 1991 CJ(Ker) 362 2}Smt.Meena Devi and others Vs. Lahar Chand and others 2003(3) T.A.C. 461 (M.P.) I have gone through the aforesaid rulings and considered the same as guidelines for me. 20]In the circumstances it is not established that, the claimant has suffered permanent disability. However, certainly he met with an accident and sustained the injury i.e. four upper teeth were uprooted. At the most Rs.25,000/­ lump­sum amount would be reasonable and fair compensation amount to be awarded by this Tribunal. Furthermore, Rs.5,000/­ for the pain and suffering would be reasonable. It comes to Rs.30,000/­ which would be reasonable amount payable by the respondents with 9% interest as per the ruling of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Smt.Neeta w/o Kallappa Kadolkar and others Vs. The Divisional Manager, MSRTC, Kolhapur, 2015(1) T.A.C. 340 (S.C.) . Hence, I answer Sunil Vs. Uttam & anr. 11 Judgment – MACP No.325/2015 issue nos.2 to 4 accordingly. Lastly, I hold that, the claim of the claimant under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act deserves to be allowed partly with proportionate costs. Hence, I pass the following order :­ ORDER 1]The claim petition of the claim petitioner is hereby allowed partly with proportionate costs. 2]Both the Respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay Rs.30,000/­ to the claimant with 9% interest from the date of filing of this claim petition till its full realization, including NFL amount of Rs.25,000/­. 3]This amount be paid to the claimant by account payee cheque. 4]Award be prepared accordingly.

The accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No.1. 3. Police authorities of Chhavni police station, Aurangabad registered offence punishable under Section 279,304- A, of The Indian Penal Code and under Section 134/183 of The Motor Vehicles Act vide crime No. I-91/2015 against driver of the offending vehicle. 4.Deceased Babasaheb was 32 years old at the time of accident. He was working as a waiter in a hotel at Waluj and was getting income of Rs.15,000/- per month. Deceased was also having agricultural land admeasuring 40 Are in his name at village 4 M.A.C.P. No.478/2015 :Judgment Lonwadi, Tq. Sillod, Dist. Aurangabad. From agricultural land, deceased Babasaheb was earning Rs.1,00,000/- per year. Claimants were dependents on his income. Due to sad demise of Babasaheb, claimants are suffering from starvation. 5.At the time of accident, the offending vehicle was o driven by respondent No.1, owned by respondent No.2 and it was validly insured with respondent No.3. Claimants have claimed compensation of Rs.10,00,000/- alongwith interest @18% p.a. from respondent Nos.1 to 3 jointly and severally. 6.Petition proceeded exparte against respondent Nos. 1 and 2. 7.Respondent No. 3 filed its written statement at Exh. 13 and denied contents of the petition. It is denied that, the offending vehicle was involved in present accident. It is further denied that, accident took place due to negligence of driver of the offending vehicle. It is submitted that, accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of motorcycle bearing registration No.MH-20-CM-1605. Age and income of the deceased at the 5 M.A.C.P. No.478/2015 :Judgment relevant time is denied. It is also denied that, the offending vehicle was validly insured with this respondent at the time of accident. Claimants have claimed excessive compensation and rate of interest. As motorcycle driver invited the accident, principle of contributory negligence be applied. Driver of the offending vehicle was not holding valid and effective motor driving license at the time of alleged accident. Therefore, there is breach of terms and conditions of insurance policy. Lastly, it is prayed to dismiss the petition against it. 8.Following issues are framed issues at Exh.20. I record my findings thereon for the reasons stated thereafter. ISSUES FINDINGS 1.Whether due to rash and negligent driving of Truck bearing registration No. GJ-03-AW-4987 the accident occurred and as a consequence thereof Babasaheb Shenphadu Sultane died ?In the affirmative 2.Whether the claimants are entitled to get compensation ? If yes, what should be the quantum ?In the affirmative as per final order 3.Who is liable to pay the compensation ? Respondent Nos.1 to 3 jointly and severally 4.What award ? As per final order 6 M.A.C.P. No.478/2015 :Judgment REASONS 9.In order to substantiate claim petition, on behalf of the claimants, claimant No.1 Padma wd/o Babasaheb Sultane filed her affidavit of examination-in-chief at Exh.22. Apart from this, claimants have filed on record certified copies of FIR (Exh.25), Spot panchnama (Exh.26), Provisional postmortem report (Exh.27), Form Comp.AA (Exh.28), Motor driving license of respondent No.1 (Exh.29), PUC Certificate of offending vehicle (Exh.30), Insurance cover note of offending vehicle (Exh.31) and 7/12 extracts (Exh.32 and 33). AS TO ISSUE NO.1 :- 10. Affidavit of examination-in-chief of claimant No.1 Padma wd/o Babasaheb Sultane is at Exh.22, wherein she deposed on the line of petition. During her cross-examination by learned Advocate for respondent No.3, except denial, nothing could be elicited to falsify occurrence of the accident. Spot panchnama (Exh.26) shows that, on 15.06.2015 at about 15.30 hours, Truck bearing registration No.GJ-03-AW-4987 gave severe dash to 7 M.A.C.P. No.478/2015 :Judgment motorcycle bearing registration No.MH-20-CM-1605 from front side. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of truck driver causing death of pillion rider of the motorcycle. Postmortem report (Exh.27) shows that, as per police inquest Babasaheb Shenphadu Sultane died on 15.06.2015 i.e on the date of accident due to 'shock and hemorrhage due to multiple injuries.' Respondents have not adduced any rebuttal evidence. Registration of crime against driver of the offending vehicle prima facie shows his negligence. Perusal of record shows that, driver of the offending vehicle has not challenged the charges levelled against him. So also, he did not step into the witness box to prove his innocence. Police papers filed on record are not denied by the respondents. In the light of above discussion, it is proved that, due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle, the accident occurred and in said accident Babasaheb Shenphadu Sultane died. Hence, I answer issue No.1 accordingly in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO. 2 :- 11.Claimant No.1 is widow, claimant No.2 is son, claimant No.3 is daughter and claimant Nos.4 and 5 are mothers of 8 M.A.C.P. No.478/2015 :Judgment deceased Babasaheb Sultane. There is no specific income of the claimants on record. Therefore, the claimants being dependents, are entitled to claim compensation on account of accidental death of Babasaheb Shenphadu Sultane. 12.Claimants have pleaded in the petition that, deceased Babasaheb Sultane was working as a waiter in a hotel and was earning Rs.15,000/- per month. In addition to this, he was also earning Rs.1,00,000/- per year from agriculture. However, claimants have not filed on record documents showing monthly income of deceased Babasaheb as Rs.15,000/-. 7/12 extracts at Exh. 32 and 33 respectively do not show exact income of deceased Babasaheb from agriculture. In the circumstances, it would be just and proper to take notional income of deceased for the purpose of awarding just compensation. Considering the date of accident, as well as rates of wages prevalent at that time, notional income of the deceased is taken as Rs.4,500/- per month. 13.There are five dependents on income of deceased. So , 1/4th amount of monthly income of the deceased is to be deducted 9 M.A.C.P. No.478/2015 :Judgment for his personal expenses. After said deduction, monthly loss of dependency would be Rs.3,375/-. Annual loss of dependency would be Rs.40,500/- 14.Claimants have pleaded age of deceased as 32 years at the time of accident. Copy of school leaving certificate of deceased Babasaheb shows his date of birth as 17.05.1983. The accident took place on 15.06.2015. It means, deceased was 32 years of age at the time of accident. Therefore, it is held that, deceased Babasaheb Sultane was 32 years of age at the time of accident. As per the ratio laid down by The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Sarla Varma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & Anr., 2009 ACJ 1298, multiplier of 16 will have to be taken. After applying said multiplier, amount of compensation comes to Rs.6,48,000/- (Rs.40,500 x 16). 15.Apart from this, claimant No.1 being widow is entitled to Rs.40,000/- for loss of consortium. Claimants are also entitled to Rs.15,000/- for loss of estate and Rs.15,000/- for funeral expenses. Thus, claimants are entitled to total amount of compensation of Rs.7,18,000/-. Hence, I answer Issue No. 2 accordingly as mentioned against it. 10 M.A.C.P. No.478/2015 :Judgment AS TO ISSUE NO.3 :- 16.Learned Advocate for respondent No.3-Insurance Company argued that, the accident took place as a result of head on collision. Therefore, in this case principle of contributory negligence be applied. 17.As per pleadings of claimants as well as police papers, deceased Babasaheb Sultane was travelling on the motorcycle as a pillion rider at the time of accident. The accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No.1. Deceased Babasaheb was not driving the motorcycle at the relevant time of accident. Therefore, principle of contributory negligence cannot be applied in this case. It is held while answering issue No.1 that,the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No.1. As per the police papers on record, at the time of accident, respondent No.1 is driver, respondent No.2 is owner and respondent No.3 is insurer of the offending vehicle. Hence, respondent Nos.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to claimants for the accidental death of Babasaheb Sultane. I answer Issue No.3 11 M.A.C.P. No.478/2015 :Judgment accordingly as mentioned against it and in answer to Issue No.4, pass following order. ORDER The Petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs as under :- 1]Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 jointly and severally do pay Rs.7,18,000/- (Rs.

Claim :­ Petition under section 166 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 for compensation of Rs.40,00,000/­ _________________________________________ Shri G.B. Gaikwad, Advocate for claimants Exparte against respondent No.1. Shri M.S. Mene, Advocate for respondent No.2 _________________________________________ JUDGMENT (Delivered on : 29.09.2017) 1.This claim petition is filed under Section 166 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 seeking compensation of Rs.40,00,000/­ due to death of Ishwar Ganesh Sapkal in motor vehicular accident. 2.Brief facts of this petition, are as under :­ On 28.01.2015, in the night at about 23.00 hours to 23.45 hours, Ishwar Sapkal was travelling from Bauli to Sillod in 3 M.A.C.P. No.451/2015 [Judgment] TATA Tipper bearing registration No. MH­20­CT­9879 on Sillod­ Ajintha road, Dongargaon shivar, Tq. Sillod, Dist. Aurangabad. At that time, one truck bearing registration No. MH­20­AA­7816 (hereinafter referred to as 'the offending vehicle') came from opposite direction in a very high and excessive speed, in rash and negligent manner and gave a heavy dash to the TATA Tipper on its driver side. In said accident, Ishwar Sapkal sustained grievous bodily injuries. After the accident, he was shifted to hospital at Sillod. The concerned doctors after check­up declared him dead. Accordingly, postmortem was carried out. 3.The police authorities of Sillod police station registered offence punishable under Section 279,304­A,337,338, of The Indian Penal Code vide crime No. I­07/2015 against driver of the offending vehicle. 4.Deceased Ishwar Sapkal was 25 years old at the time of accident. He was doing business of transport and was earning Rs.50,000/­ per month from said business. The deceased was studied upto D.Ed. He was also serving as an Assistant Teacher in 4 M.A.C.P. No.451/2015 [Judgment] Siddhivinayak Shikshan Sanstha, Daygaon, Tq. Gangapur, Dist. Aurangabad and was getting salary of Rs.5,200/­ to Rs.20,200/­ per month. The deceased was also doing agriculture work and was earning Rs.30,000/­ per month. The deceased was only Karta of his family. All the claimants were dependents on his income. Due to sad demise of Ishwar, the claimants are suffering from financial hardship. 5.At the time of accident, the offending vehicle was owned and driven by respondent No.1 and was insured with respondent No.2. The claimants claimed compensation of Rs.40,00,000/­ alongwith interest @18% p.a. from respondent Nos.1 and 2 jointly and severally. 6.Inspite of due service, respondent No.1 did not appear. Hence, the petition proceeded exparte against him. 7.Respondent No. 2 filed its written statement at Exh. 11 and denied contents of the petition. It is admitted that, the offending vehicle was insured at the material time of the accident. Driver of the offending vehicle was not holding valid and effective 5 M.A.C.P. No.451/2015 [Judgment] driving license at the time of accident. Therefore, there is breach of terms of insurance policy. The offending vehicle was not involved in the accident. The deceased himself is responsible for the accident. It is denied that, at the time of accident, deceased Ishwar was 25 years old and was earning monthly income, as alleged, from different sources. Registration of offence at Sillod police station is admitted by this respondent. The claimants have claimed excessive compensation. Lastly, it is prayed to dismiss the petition. 8.Following issues are framed at Exh. 16. I record my findings thereon for the reasons stated thereafter. ISSUES FINDINGS 1.Whether due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing registration No. MH­20­AA­7816 the accident occurred and as a consequence thereof Ishwar Ganesh Sapkal died ?In the affirmative 2.Whether the claimants are entitled to get compensation ? If yes, what should be the quantum ?In the affirmative As per final order 3.Who is liable to pay the compensation ? Respondent Nos.1&2 jointly&severally 4.What order ? As per final order 6 M.A.C.P. No.451/2015 [Judgment] REASONS 9.In order to substantiate the claim petition, on behalf of the claimants, claimant No.1 Chhaya wd/o Ishwar Sapkal filed her affidavit of examination­in­chief at Exh. 18. Apart from this, the claimants have filed on record certified copies of FIR (Exh.23), Spot panchnama (Exh.24), Form Comp.AA (Exh.25), Inquest panchnama (Exh.26), Police report alongwith dead body alongwith Postmortem (Exh.27), Permit of offending vehicle (Exh.30), Fitness certificate of the offending vehicle (Exh.31), Motor driving license of respondent No.1 (Exh.32),Insurance cover note of the offending vehicle (Exh.33), Charge­sheet (Exh. 40), 7/12 extract of land in Gut No.50/1 at village Sillod, Dist. Aurangabad(Exh. 41) and other documents. AS TO ISSUE NO.1 :­ 10. Affidavit of examination­in­chief of claimant No.1 Chhaya wd/o Ishwar Sapkal is replica of the claim petition. During her cross­examination by Advocate for respondent No.2, nothing 7 M.A.C.P. No.451/2015 [Judgment] could be elicited to falsify occurrence of accident. She denied all adverse suggestions during her cross­examination. 11.Spot panchnama (Exh.24) shows that, the spot of accident is located on Sillod­Ajintha road in Dongargaon shivar. Said road is 20 feet wide and there is kaccha road of 5 feet on its both sides. Pieces of fiber of Tipper vehicle bearing No. MH­20­ CT­9879 are seen on kaccha road. The Tipper is seen dashed to Sirsam tree from cleaner side. Cabin of the Tipper is pressed. Blood is seen inside and outside of its cabin. The Tipper is damaged to the extent of 75 per cent. Sketch of spot also supports contention of the claimants about the accident. Apart from this, FIR(Exh.23) shows that, the offence is registered against respondent No.1 i.e. driver of the offending vehicle for causing death by rash and negligent driving. Concerned police after investigation have filed charge­sheet against driver of the offending truck i.e. respondent No.1. 12. Respondent No. 2 has not adduced any rebuttal 8 M.A.C.P. No.451/2015 [Judgment] evidence. Registration of crime against driver of the offending vehicle prima facie shows his negligence. Perusal of record shows that, respondent No.1 has not challenged charges levelled against him. Respondent No.1 did not step into the witness box to prove his innocence. The police papers filed on record are not denied by the respondents. Inquest panchnama (Exh.26) reveals that, Ishwar Ganesh Spakal died on 8.01.2015 i.e. on the date of accident. Accordingly, inquest was conducted on the same day. Postmortem report (Exh.27) also depicts that, Ishwar Sapkal died on 28.01.2015, mentioning cause of death as 'Cardio respiratory arrest due to hemorrhage and shock due to head injuries.' In the light of above discussion, it is proved that, due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No.1, the accident occurred and in said accident Ishwar Ganesh Sapkal died. Hence, I answer issue No.1 accordingly in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE Nos. 2 & 3 :­ 13.Claimant No.1 is widow, claimant No.2 is father, claimant No.3 is mother, claimant No.4 is brother and claimant 9 M.A.C.P. No.451/2015 [Judgment] No.5 is minor daughter of deceased Ishwar Sapkal. Claimant No.4 Chetan is major brother of the deceased. During lifetime of his parents, claimant No.4 cannot be dependent on income of the deceased. Therefore, the claimant Nos.1 to 3 and 5 being dependents, are entitled to claim compensation on account of accidental death of Ishwar Sapkal. 14.The claimants have pleaded in the petition that, deceased Ishwar Sapkal was serving as Assistant Teacher in Siddhivinayak Shikshan Sanstha at Daygaon, Tq. Gangapur, Dist. Aurangabad and was earning salary of Rs.5,200/­ to Rs.20,200/­ per month. The deceased was also doing business of supply of sand by the Tipper and was earning Rs.50,000/­ per month. The deceased was also earning Rs.1,00,000/­ to Rs.2,00,000/­ annually from agriculture work. 15.Learned Advocate for respondent No.2 argued that, although the claimants have pleaded monthly income of the deceased under different heads, however, they have not filed on 10 M.A.C.P. No.451/2015 [Judgment] record any documentary evidence showing exact monthly income of the deceased. In the circumstances, the notional income of the deceased be taken into consideration for the purpose of calculation of compensation. 16.The claimants have not filed on record cogent and convincing documentary evidence showing monthly income of the deceased. The 7/12 extract ( Exh. 41) shows that, the agricultural land is standing in the name of father of the deceased. There is no specific income brought on record of the deceased. Hence, I find substance in the arguments of learned Advocate for respondent No.2. In the circumstances, it would be just and proper to take notional income of the deceased for the purpose of computation of compensation. Considering the date of accident, as well as rates of wages prevalent at that time, notional income of the deceased is taken as Rs.5,000/­ per month. 17.There are four dependents on the income of the deceased. Therefore, 1/4th amount of monthly income of the 11 M.A.C.P. No.451/2015 [Judgment] deceased is to be deducted towards his personal expenses. After said deduction, monthly loss of dependency would be Rs.3,750/­. Annual loss of dependency would be Rs.45,000/­ 18.The claimants have pleaded age of the deceased as 26 years at the time of accident. Copy of Secondary School Certificate of the deceased shows his date of birth as 08.05.1989. The present accident took place on 28.01.2015. It is cleared that, deceased Ishwar Sapkal was 26 years of age at the time of accident. Therefore, as per the ratio laid down by The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Sarla Varma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & Anr., 2009 ACJ 1298, multiplier of 17 will have to be taken. After applying said multiplier, amount of compensation comes to Rs.7,65,000/­(Rs.45,000 x 17). 19.Apart from this, claimant No.1 being widow is entitled to Rs.1,00,000/­ for loss of consortium, claimant Nos.2 to 5 are entitled to Rs.1,00,000/­ for loss of love and affection. The claimants are also entitled to Rs.25,000/­ for funeral expenses. 12 M.A.C.P. No.451/2015 [Judgment] Thus, the claimants are entitled to total amount of compensation of Rs.9,90,000/­. 20.As discussed earlier, it is proved that, at the time of accident, the offending vehicle was owned and driven by respondent No.1 and was validly insured with respondent No.2­ insurance company. It is also proved that, due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No.1, the accident happened and Ishwar Sapkal succumbed to the injuries sustained in said accident. Therefore, respondent Nos.1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the claimants for the accidental death of Ishwar Sapkal. Hence, I answer Issue Nos.2 and 3 accordingly as mentioned against it and in answer to issue No.4, pass following order :­ ORDER The Petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs as under :­ 1]Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 jointly and severally do pay Rs.9,90,000/­ (Rs. Nine Lakh Ninety Thousand only) (inclusive of NFL amount) alongwith interest @ 8% per annum from the date of the petition till its realization to the claimants. 13 M.A.C.P. No.451/2015 [Judgment] 2]Out of said amount, Rs.5,00,000/­ be given to claimant No. 1. Out of said amount, Rs.2,00,000/­ be invested in the Fixed Deposit in her name, in any nationalized bank of her choice for the period of three years. She shall be at liberty to withdraw the amount of interest accrued on the fixed deposit amount monthly, if desired. Remaining amount of Rs.3,00,000/­ be given to her by account payee cheque in her name on due identification. 3]Out of compensation amount, Rs.50,000/­ each be given to claimant Nos.2 and 3 by account payee cheques in their respective names on due identification. 4]Out of compensation amount, Rs.25,000/­ be given to claimant No.4 by account payee cheque in his name on due identification. 5]Out of compensation amount, Rs.3,65,000/­ be given to claimant No.5. Since she is minor, said amount be invested in fixed deposit in her name under guardianship of claimant No.1 in any Nationalized Bank, till she attains majority.

Claim : Compensation u/section 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act for grant of compensation amount. ….......................................................................... Shri P . B. Khedkar, Advocate for the claimant. Shri S.D.Shinde, Advocate for respondent no.1. Shri C. N. Andure, Advocate for respondents no.2 & 3. .............................................................................. 2 [MACP 41/2015 [J] JUDGMENT ( Delivered on 28­08­2018 ) 1] This is an application under section 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, claiming compensation on account of injuries sustained to claimant Sanket in motor accident dated 29­04­2012 Near Rama Nagar Bridge on Aurangabad­Jalna Road, within the jurisdiction of Aurangabad City involving Ape Rickshaw bearing No. MH­20­AA­3446 driven by respondent no.3. 2]In short, the case of applicant is that, on 29­04­2012 at about 04.00 p.m claimant along with his friend, Saurabh Bhanudas Aswar was proceeding in Ape Rickshaw bearing No. MH­20­AA­3446 driven by respondent no.3 towards his house after completion of tuition from Cidco, Aurangabad. When he reached near Ramnagar Bridge, due to rash and negligent driving, the Ape Rickshaw got turtled and the claimant sustained serious injuries. The claimant was taken to Sahyadari Multispeciality Hospital, Mukundwadi, Aurangabad for medical treatment from 24.4.2012 to 01.5.2012 for which he was required to spend Rs.50,000/­. 3]The claimant was 15 years old studying in 10th standard. In the alleged accident, he sustained permanent disability to his left hand. Prior to the accident, he was selling news papers and getting Rs.5,000/­ per month and helping his family but due to 3 [MACP 41/2015 [J] injuries, the same is stopped and whole family is suffering starvation. 4]After preliminary inquiry, Police Station Officer of Police Station, MIDC Cidco, Aurangabad registered Crime No.I­15/2013 for offences u/S.279, 337, 338, 427 of IPC against driver i.e. respondent no.3 Bhagchand Nataji Patere on the basis of statement of Bhanudas Dhondiram Aswar etc. During investigation, it was transpired, respondent no.3 drove the offending Ape Rickshaw bearing No. MH­ 20­AA­3446 in rash and negligent manner and the Apex Rickshaw got turtled due to which the claimant sustained grievous injuries to his left hand and other parts of body. It is further transpired, the offending vehicle was insured with respondent no.1 and it was owned by respondent no.2. Thus, by way of this petition, the claimant has claimed total compensation of Rs.5 lakhs from respondents no.1 to 3 jointly and severally. 5]Respondent no.1 Insurance Company filed its Written Statement vide Exh.13 denying all adverse allegations made by the claimant. The insurance company contended that, the claimant in collusion with respondents no.2 and 3 has filed this claim petition by preparing false and fabricated documents only to grab compensation amount from this respondent and therefore, this respondent is not at all liable to pay compensation to the claimant. Respondent no.1 further contended that, 24 days unexplained delay in lodging the FIR 4 [MACP 41/2015 [J] creates doubt about truthfulness of alleged accident. Respondent no.3 was not having valid and effective driving license and respondent no.2 was not having valid fitness certificate and permit on the date of alleged accident and therefore, owner and driver of offending Ape Rickshaw committed breach of terms of insurance policy. Therefore, this respondent is not liable to pay compensation amount, if any. For these reasons, insurance company has prayed for dismissal of application with costs. 6]Respondents no.2 and 3 filed their joint Written Statement vide Exh­21 and thereby denied all adverse allegations made against them. They contended that, there was no fault on the part of driver of Ape Rickshaw bearing registration No.MH­20­AA­ 3446 and false complaint is filed against respondent no.3. They further contended that, offending Ape Rickshaw was validly insured with respondent no.1 Insurance Company from 21.6.2011 to 20.6.2012 and there is no breach of terms of insurance policy. They further contended that, if this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that, respondents no.2 and 3 are liable to pay compensation amount to the claimant, then liability may be shifted to respondent no.1 Insurance Company. For these reasons, respondents no.2 and 3 prayed for dismissal of application with cost. 7]On the basis of above pleadings of the parties, the then 5 [MACP 41/2015 [J] Member, MACT framed the following issues at Exh.28: SR.No. ISSUES 1Does the claimant prove that, the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of Ape Rickshaw bearing registration No.MH­20­AA­3446 ? 2Does the claimant prove that, he sustained permanent disability in the above motor vehicular accident ? If yes, to what extent ? 3Does the claimant prove that, respondent no.2 is owner of Ape Rickshaw bearing registration No.MH­20­AA­3446, respondent no.3 is its driver and respondent no.1 is its Insurance Company ? 4Whether claimants are entitled for compensation ? If yes, to what extent ? 5Who is liable to pay compensation amount ? 6What order ? My findings to the above issues for the reasons stated below are as under: Findings 1.Affirmative. 2. Affirmative. 3.Affirmative 4.Yes, Rs.1,50,000/­ along with 9% p.a. interest. 5. Respondents no.1 to 3 jointly and severally. 6.As per final order. 6 [MACP 41/2015 [J] REASONS AS TO ISSUE NO.1 TO 3 : 8]In order to prove the claim, the father of Sanket, namely, Pandurang Punjaram Raut deposed as PW­1 vide Exh.29. He has also examined PW­2 Dr.Sachin Surendra Bedmutha vide Exh­39. Applicant has produced copies of Charge Sheet Exh­32, FIR Exh­33, Spot Panchanama Exh­34, Certificate of Registration of Vehicle Ape Rickshaw No.MH­20AA­3446 Exh­48, Permit of Ape Rickshaw Exh­ 49, Insurance Cover Note of Ape Rickshaw Exh­35, Accident Information Report (Form 54) of claimant Exh­36, Driving License of respondent no.3 Exh­37, Certificate of Fitness of Ape Rickshaw Exh­ 50, Discgharge Card Exh­40, Cash Memo Exh­41, Receipt of Hopsital Bill Exh­42, and Certificate for removal of Nail Exh­44, Permanent Disability Certificate Exh­43 and closed evidence by filing Pursis vide Exh­45. 9]On the other hand, respondent no.1 Insurance Company filed Purshis Exh­46 and thereby closed its side. 10]As regard rash and negligent driving, Crime No. 15/2013 is registered against driver of offending vehicle i.e. Ape Rickshaw bearing NO. MH­20­AA­3446. The driver of Ape Rickshaw did not enter into the witness box to rebute the allegations of rash and negligent driving by him. FIR Exh­33 and Spot Panchanama 7 [MACP 41/2015 [J] Exh­34 show reference of how the driver of offending vehicle i.e. Ape Rickshaw was rash and negligent at the time of alleged accident. Already charge sheet (SCC No.2379/2013) is also filed against driver of offending vehicle i.e. Ape Rickshaw. Respondent no.1 Insurance Company has not examined any witness to deny the case of claimant. 11]The copy of registration certificate of Ape Rickshaw bearing No. MH­20­AA­3446 Exh­48 filed on record shows since 18.11.2005 said Ape Rickshaw is standing in the name of respondent no.2 Shaikh Qadar Shaikh Fattu. Insurance Policy Cover Note Exh.35 filed on record with regard to truck bearing No. MH­20­AA­3446 shows said Ape rickshaw was insured for the period between 21.06.2011 to 20.6.2012. Investigation papers on record show, alleged accident took­place on 29.04.2012. So it is clear that on the day of alleged accident Ape Rickshaw involved in this accident was fully insured. 12]In the light of all above discussion, it is clear that alleged accident took­place because of rash and negligent driving at the hands of driver of offending vehicle i.e. Ape rickshaw. Therefore, I hold that the accident in question was caused solely on account of negligence driving of the Ape Rickshaw in question by its driver namely Bhagchand Nataji Patere. So, respondents no.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable for compensation of alleged accident. 8 [MACP 41/2015 [J] 13]Learned advocate for claimant submitted that applicant is sustained permanent disability due to injury sustained in alleged accident. In order to prove the said permanent disability, applicant has examined PW­2 Dr. Suchin Bedmutha (Jain) who examined applicant Sanket on 10.5.2017 and issued Disability Certificate as per Exh.43. As per reference in the said Disability Certificate, applicant Sanket sustained in all 17% permanent disability. Basically, if we peruse the Disability Certificate on record Exh­43 minutely, it reveals, the date of physical examination of claimant Sanket shown as 10.5.2017. Dr.Sachin Bedmutha also deposed that, he examined said Sanket on 10.5.2017 and prior to that, since 19.4.2012, he treated him i.e. Sanket. In other words, according to PW­2 Dr.Sachin Bedmutha, after alleged accident Sanket was admitted in his hospital for medical treatment. So, I have no reason to disbelieve the evidence of PW­2 Dr.Sachin Bedmutha. Therefore I answer Issues no. 1 to 3 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUES NO.4 TO 6: 14]In order to prove the fact of payment of hospital bill and purchase of medicine, PW­1 Pandurang deposed in detail vide Exh­29 as per pleadings in the petition. PW­2 Dr.Sachin Bedmutha also deposed that, Sanket was admitted in his hospital and he provided medical aid to him as per Discharge Card Exh­40. Further, he has 9 [MACP 41/2015 [J] also deposed that, an amount of Rs.30,000/­ was paid on behalf of claimant Sanket as a hospital bill (Exh­41 and 42). He further deposed that, Sanket need Rs.30,000/­ for future medical treatment as per Exh­44. Ld. Advocate for respondent no.1 Insurance Company cross­examined him but nothing has come on record to create doubt about the medical examination to Sanket. So, claimant is entitled to recover Rs.60,000/­ under the head of past and future medical expenses. 15]In addition to this learned advocate for claimant submitted that applicant has sustained permanent disability due to injury sustained in alleged accident. In order to prove the said permanent disability, applicant has examined PW­2 Dr. Sachin Surendra Bedmutha vide Exh.39. This witness i.e. PW­2 Dr. Bedmutha deposed that on 10­05­2017 he examined applicant Sanket and issued disability certificate as per Exh.43. It is revealed that from the said disability certificate that applicant Sanket sustained total 17% permanent disability, Dr. Bedmutha has treated him i.e. applicant Sanket. Considering the testimony of Dr. Bedmutha i.e. expert in medical field, I am of the opinion that 17% disability can be taken in consideration. 16]Considering the permanent disability of 17% as sustained by petitioner Sanket, he is justified in getting an amount of 10 [MACP 41/2015 [J] Rs.50,000/­ towards pains and agony. Moreover, an amount of Rs.10,000/­ (Rupees Ten thousand only) is just and proper towards loss of future happiness and an amount of Rs.10,000/­(Rupees Ten thousand only) is just and proper to loss of shortening of life span. Similarly, applicant is justified in getting an amount of Rs.10,000/­ (Rupees Ten thousand only) towards special diet. Attendant was there to look­after the applicant during his admission in the hospital. So he is justified in getting an amount of Rs.5,000/­ (Rupees Five thousand only) towards attendants charges. Moreover, applicant was required to visit the hospital from time to time for treatment. So an amount of Rs.5,000/­ (Rupees Five thousand only) is just and proper towards transportation charges. As stated above, applicant is entitled to get an amount of Rs.90,000/­ (Rupees Ninety thousand only). 17]Thus, petitioner Sanket is entitled to get net compensation of Rs. 60,000 + 90,000 = Rs.1,50,000/­ (Rupees One lakh Fifty thousand only ) including NFL amount. Admittedly Ape Rickshaw involved in accident is owned by applicant no.2 and it was driven by respondent no.3 at the time of accident. Respondent no.2 is owner of the said Ape Rickshaw and respondent no.3 is its insurance company. So respondent no.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation of Rs.1,50,000/­ ( Rupees One lakh Fifty thousand only) including NFL amount to applicant Sanket along with interest 11 [MACP 41/2015 [J] @ 9% per annum from the date of filing of the petition till realization of entire amount of compensation. Hence, I answer Issues no. 4, 5 accordingly and in answer to issue no.6 pass following order. ORDER 1.Application is partly allowed with costs. 2.Respondents no.1 to 3 shall jointly and/or severally pay sum of Rs.1,50,000/­(Rupees One lac Fifty thousand only) inclusive of the NFL to the applicant along with interest @ 9% p.a from the date of filing of the petition till realization of the entire amount. 3.On depositing compensation amount of Rs.1,50,000/­ along with interest thereon in the Tribunal by respondents, Rs.50,000/­ be invested in any nationalised bank in the name of claimant Sanket Pandurang Raut for a period of three years. 4.The claimant is entitled to receive remaining balance amount together with interest on entire compensation amount through his father, natural guardian Pandurang Punjaram Raut, for his i.e. claimant's welfare by account payee cheque. 5.The Account officer/Nazir is directed to handover cheque to the applicant by obtaining acknowledgment thereof. 6. An award shall be drawn up accordingly. Dictated and pronounced in open court.

J U D G M E N T [ Delivered on 10th January, 2017 ] The present petition is filed for grant of compensation U/s 166 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, on account of unfortunate death of Bhagwan Bhausaheb Karad R/o Chittegaon road, near Petrol Pump, Bidkin Tq. Paithan, District Aurangabad in a motor vehicle accident. 2.Claimants are legal representatives of deceased Bhagwan Bhausaheb Karad who lost his life on 11.3.2015 because of injuries sustained to him in motor vehicle accident. Claimant No.1 is the widow, claimant No.2 & 3 are children and claimant No.4 & 5 are the parents of deceased Bhagwan Bhausaheb Karad. 3.Brief facts of the case­ [ 3] M.A.C.P.No.299/2015, [Judgment]. It is the case of claimants that on 11.3.2015 at about 2.45 p.m. deceased Bhagwan Bhausaheb Karad was travelling on his motorcycle bearing registration No. MH­20­BG­0474. He was proceeding from Bidkin towards Paithan. When he reached in Taherpur Shivar, Tq. Paithan, one Tata ACE pickup van bearing registration No.MH­20­DE­2398 came in high speed, rash and negligent manner and gave severe dash to the motorcycle of deceased from backside, due to which the accident occurred and the deceased sustained multiple injuries to his vital parts of body. The deceased was immediately shifted to Rural Hospital at Bidkin where he was declared dead by the Medical Officer. 4.On the basis of report lodged by one Rajendra Annasaheb Kharad, on 12.3.2015, Bidkin Police Station registered an offence vide Crime No.I­ 56/2015 under Section 279, 304­A of IPC against the driver of Tata ACE bearing registration No. MH­20­DE­2398 i.e. respondent No.1. 5.The claimants further contended that at the time of accident, the deceased was 40 years of age and used to earn Rs.11,835/­ per month by working with Matrix Science Private Ltd. The claimants further contended that the respondent No.1 was driving Tata ACE bearing registration No. MH­20­DE­2398 at the time of accident, said Tata ACE was owned by respondent No.2 and insured with respondent No.3. Therefore, respondent No.1,2 & 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the claimants. The claimants have claimed [ 4] M.A.C.P.No.299/2015, [Judgment]. compensation to the tune of Rs.25,00,000/­ including the compensation under other conventional heads. 6.Respondent No.1 filed his Written Statement at Exh­22. He contended that the deceased was driving his vehicle in high speed and in negligent manner because of which the accident occurred. He further denied the age and income of the deceased and prayed that the petition be rejected. 7.Respondent No.2 filed his Written Statement at Exh­23. He took the defence taken by respondent No.1 and submitted that the petition be rejected. 8.Respondent No.3 filed their Written Statement at Exh­16 and contended that the deceased has himself given dash to Tata ACE bearing registration No.MH­20­DE­2398. They further denied the age, income of the deceased and prayed that the petition be rejected. 9.On rival pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed by me at Exh­21 and I record my findings against each of them for the reasons stated below. I S S U E S F I N D I N G S 1.Whether the claimants prove that deceased Bhagwan Bhausaheb Kharad died in a motor accident held on 11.03.2015 ? .. Yes. 2.Whether the claimants prove that respondent No.1 was driving Tata ACE bearing No.MH­20­DE­2398 [ 5] M.A.C.P.No.299/2015, [Judgment]. in a rash and negligent manner and gave dash to the motorcycle bearing No.MH­20­BG­0474 of deceased from backside because of which the accident occurred ? ..

Yes, Rs.17,65,679/­from respondent No.1 to 3 jointly & severally @ 7% per annum. 4.What order & award ? .. As per final order. R E A S O N S 10.In order to substantiate the contentions raised in the petition, claimant No.1 Alka Bhagwan Kharad deposed before this court as CW1 by filing her affidavit of evidence at Exh­27 and also examined Nitish Kumar Satish Vyas at Exh­41. Claimant has also placed on record certified copies of relevant police papers pertaining to the accident in question. They are FIR at Exh­29, Report at Exh­28, Spot Panchanama at Exh­30, Form Compound­AA at Exh­31, Postmortem Report at Exh­32, Driving License of respondent No.1 at Exh­33, Registration Certificate of offending vehicle at Exh­34, Insurance Policy of offending vehicle at Exh­35, Fitness Certificate of offending vehicle at Exh­36, Form T.C. At Exh­37, School Leaving Certificate of deceased at Exh­43, Attendance Register of Matrix Fine Science Private Ltd. at Exh­45, Pass Book of deceased of Bank of Maharashtra at Exh­38, Salary Slip at Exh­44 and filed [ 6] M.A.C.P.No.299/2015, [Judgment]. evidence closed Pursis at Exh­47. 11.Respondent No.1 & 2 did not lead any evidence and filed evidence close Pursis at Exh­48. 12.Respondent No.3 failed to adduce any evidence, hence their evidence was closed vide order dated 05.01.2015. 13.Heard Learned advocate Shri S.K.Hivale for the claimants. Shri Jagdish Rathod Advocate for respondent No.1 & 2, and Shri K.A.Bankar Advocate for respondent No.3. As to Issue No.1 & 2 : 14.The Learned advocate appearing for claimants submitted that police papers pertaining to the accident in question clearly indicates that respondent No.1 was driving Tata ACE bearing registration No.MH­20­DE­2398 in rash and negligent manner and gave dash to the motorcycle bearing registration No.MH­ 20­BG­0474 of deceased from backside and caused death of deceased Bhagwan Bhausaheb Kharad. He further submitted that respondent No.2 is the owner of offending Tata ACE and the same was insured with respondent No.3. Therefore, they are vicariously liable to pay for negligency of their driver i.e. respondent No.1. 15.Respondent No.3 submitted that perusal of spot panchanama at Exh­30 filed by the claimants shows that the front portion of the motorcycle [ 7] M.A.C.P.No.299/2015, [Judgment]. bearing registration No.MH­20­BG­0474 was damaged. The claimant has contended that the offending vehicle has given dash to the motorcycle from backside and the motorcycle was not damaged from backside which clearly established that the alleged accident has occurred because of negligency of the deceased. He further submitted that the police papers on record does not show that the deceased was wearing helmet while driving his motorcycle at the time of accident. He further submitted that if the deceased was wearing the helmet, it would have prevented the impact of the accident. Therefore, the facts on record shows that the deceased was not wearing helmet therefore, he is also contributory to the accident and relied upon the judgment passed by the Hon'ble High Court of Kerla in Siby Paul Vs Praveen Kumar G.N. Reported in 2008 CJ (Ker) 431 and submitted that the accident has not occurred because of negligency of respondent No.1. 16.It is seen that on 11.3.2015 deceased sustained injuries in motor accident and died on the same day. The cause of death given in Postmortem Report at Exh­32 is “Hemorrhage due to multiple Neurogenic shock, due to multiple injuries of head, chest and other parts of body, rupture of multiple organ in TRA”. 17.It is seen from the testimony of CW1, the copy of report at Exh­28, FIR at Exh­29 and Spot Panchanama at Exh­30 that the respondent No.1 was [ 8] M.A.C.P.No.299/2015, [Judgment]. driving Tata ACE bearing registration No. MH­20­DE­2398 in rash and negligent manner. The respondent No.1 driver of offending vehicle Tata ACE has not stepped into witness box so as to rebut the testimony of CW1 and the documents filed by the claimants. The submission of Learned advocate for respondent No.3 that the deceased was negligent in driving his vehicle does not find any support on the evidence on record. Hence, I answer Issue No.1 & 2 as 'Yes'. As to Issue No.3 : 18.CW1 in her deposition has stated that her husband was working in Matrix Fine Science Private Ltd., MIDC, Paithan District Aurangabad as electrician and was earning salary of Rs.11,835/­ per month. CW2 the Accountant in Matrix Fine Science Private Ltd. has deposed that the deceased Bhagwan Bhausaheb Kharad was working in their company as electrician. He was appointed in their company on 20.3.2014 and was earning gross salary of Rs.11,835/­. He further deposed that the salary of said deceased was paid in his bank account and the deceased was employed in their company because he was holding I.T.I. Diploma in electrician. The salary certificate filed at Exh­44 shows that the deceased was getting net salary of Rs.8,911/­ per month. The bank pass book at Exh­38 shows that salary for the month of February was credited in the bank account of the deceased. Therefore, it will be proper to take Rs.8,911/­ as income of the deceased. Therefore, the annual income of deceased will be [ 9] M.A.C.P.No.299/2015, [Judgment]. Rs.8,911 X 12 Months = Rs.1,06,932/­. It appears from the record that the deceased was having five dependents at the time of accident. Therefore, 1/4th of his annual income is deducted as his personal expenses. His annual earning after deduction will come to Rs.80,199/­. CW1 has deposed that the age of deceased was 40 years at the time of accident. To prove the age of deceased, the claimants have filed School Leaving Certificate of deceased at Exh­43. The date of birth mentioned in the school leaving certificate of the deceased is 12.7.1972. The accident has taken place on 11.3.2015. Therefore, the age of deceased at the time of accident was 43 years. Hence, the multiplier of 14 is applied as per the guidelines issued by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Smt. Sarla Verma Vs Delhi Transportation Corporation and another reported in AIR 2009 (SC) 3104. Therefore, the loss of dependency comes to Rs.11,22,786/­. 19.The Hon'ble Apex Court in Rajesh & Ors. Vs Rajbir Singh & Ors. Reported in 2013 (9) SCC 54 has held that “death of persons who are self employed or persons with fixed wages should be given future prospectus”. The age of deceased as per Exh­43 was 43 years at the time of accident. Therefore, 30% of loss of dependency is taken as future prospectus i.e. Rs.3,36,836/­. 20.It appears from the police papers filed on record that the deceased was not wearing helmet at the time of accident. The deceased was not responsible for the accident but if he had been wearing helmet, it would have [ 10] M.A.C.P.No.299/2015, [Judgment]. reduced the impact of the accident. Therefore, it would be proper in the present case to deduct 15% from the loss of dependency and future earning amount as contributory of the deceased towards the accident. Therefore, an amount of Rs.2,18,943/­ is deducted from total loss of dependency of deceased. 21.The claimant No.1 has lost her husband, therefore, she is entitle to an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ towards consortium. The claimant No.1 is also entitle for an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ towards loss of estate as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kalpanaraj & Ors. Vs Tamilnadu State Transport Corporation reported in 2014 (5) Scale 479 . The claimant No.2 & 3 have lost their father, therefore, they are entitle for Rs.1,00,000/­ each towards lost of love and affection as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Juju Kuruvila & Ors. Vs Kunjujamma Mohan & Others reported in (2013) 9 S.C.C. 166 . The claimant No.4 & 5 have lost their son, therefore, they are entitle for Rs.50,000/­ each towards love and affection of their deceased son as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in M. Mansoor and Anr. Vs United India Insurance Co.Ltd., reported in 2013 12 Scale 324 . 22.The claimants are further entitle to an amount of Rs.25,000/­ towards funeral expenses of deceased. Therefore, the claimants are entitle to total compensation of Rs.17,65,679/­. 23.The claimants have received Rs.50,000/­ towards interim compensation under the head of 'No Fault Liability'. Therefore, it will be [ 11] M.A.C.P.No.299/2015, [Judgment]. appropriate to deduct the said amount from total compensation. After deducting the amount of interim compensation, an amount of Rs. 17,15,679/­. 24.It is seen from Exh­28, 29, 30, 31 & 35 that the offending vehicle was owned by respondent No.2 and insured with respondent No.3. In such circumstances, respondent No.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to claimants for the death of deceased. 25.So far as rate of interest is concern, considering the period of pendency of matter and the amount of compensation, interest @ 7% per annum from the date of petition, till realization of compensation amount would meet the ends of justice. Hence, I answer issue No.3 accordingly and pass the following order. O R D E R 1.The petition is partly allowed. 2.Claimant No.1 to 5 are entitle to get compensation of Rs.17,65,679/­ inclusive of No Fault Liability. 3.Respondent No.1 to 3 do pay an amount of 17,15,679/­ exclusive of 'No Fault Liability' amount to claimant No.1 to 5, towards compensation jointly and severally, along with 7% interest per annum, from the date of filing of petition, till realization of entire amount. 4.The amount of 17,15,679/­ be appropriated amongst claimant No.1 to 5 as under­ i)Claimant No.1 Rs.4,43,139/­. ii)Claimant No.2 & 3 Rs.3,43,135/­ each. iii)Claimant No.4 & 5 Rs. 2,93,135/­ each. [ 12] M.A.C.P.No.299/2015, [Judgment]. 5.Out of compensation amount payable to claimant No.1, an amount of Rs.2,25,000/­ be invested in Fixed Deposit in her name, in any Nationalized Bank, for the period of two years and remaining amount be paid to her by account payee cheque, on identification. 6.Compensation amount payable to claimant No.2 & 3 be fixed in their names, in any Nationalized Bank, till they attains majority and the claimant No1 is at liberty to receive the interest on fixed deposit quarterly, if she desire so. 7.Out of compensation amount payable to claimant No.4 & 5, an amount of Rs.1,25,000/­ each be invested in Fixed Deposit in their name, in any Nationalized Bank, for the period of one year and remaining amount be paid to them by account payee cheque, on identification. 8.Respondent No.1 to 3 do pay jointly and severally proportionate cost of the petition to the claimants and bear their own cost. 9.Award be drawn accordingly.

J U D G M E N T [ Delivered on 10th January, 2017 ] The present petition is filed for grant of compensation U/s 166 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, on account of unfortunate death of Bhagwan Bhausaheb Karad R/o Chittegaon road, near Petrol Pump, Bidkin Tq. Paithan, District Aurangabad in a motor vehicle accident. 2.Claimants are legal representatives of deceased Bhagwan Bhausaheb Karad who lost his life on 11.3.2015 because of injuries sustained to him in motor vehicle accident. Claimant No.1 is the widow, claimant No.2 & 3 are children and claimant No.4 & 5 are the parents of deceased Bhagwan Bhausaheb Karad. 3.Brief facts of the case­ [ 3] M.A.C.P.No.299/2015, [Judgment]. It is the case of claimants that on 11.3.2015 at about 2.45 p.m. deceased Bhagwan Bhausaheb Karad was travelling on his motorcycle bearing registration No. MH­20­BG­0474. He was proceeding from Bidkin towards Paithan. When he reached in Taherpur Shivar, Tq. Paithan, one Tata ACE pickup van bearing registration No.MH­20­DE­2398 came in high speed, rash and negligent manner and gave severe dash to the motorcycle of deceased from backside, due to which the accident occurred and the deceased sustained multiple injuries to his vital parts of body. The deceased was immediately shifted to Rural Hospital at Bidkin where he was declared dead by the Medical Officer. 4.On the basis of report lodged by one Rajendra Annasaheb Kharad, on 12.3.2015, Bidkin Police Station registered an offence vide Crime No.I­ 56/2015 under Section 279, 304­A of IPC against the driver of Tata ACE bearing registration No. MH­20­DE­2398 i.e. respondent No.1. 5.The claimants further contended that at the time of accident, the deceased was 40 years of age and used to earn Rs.11,835/­ per month by working with Matrix Science Private Ltd. The claimants further contended that the respondent No.1 was driving Tata ACE bearing registration No. MH­20­DE­2398 at the time of accident, said Tata ACE was owned by respondent No.2 and insured with respondent No.3. Therefore, respondent No.1,2 & 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the claimants. The claimants have claimed [ 4] M.A.C.P.No.299/2015, [Judgment]. compensation to the tune of Rs.25,00,000/­ including the compensation under other conventional heads. 6.Respondent No.1 filed his Written Statement at Exh­22. He contended that the deceased was driving his vehicle in high speed and in negligent manner because of which the accident occurred. He further denied the age and income of the deceased and prayed that the petition be rejected. 7.Respondent No.2 filed his Written Statement at Exh­23. He took the defence taken by respondent No.1 and submitted that the petition be rejected. 8.Respondent No.3 filed their Written Statement at Exh­16 and contended that the deceased has himself given dash to Tata ACE bearing registration No.MH­20­DE­2398. They further denied the age, income of the deceased and prayed that the petition be rejected. 9.On rival pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed by me at Exh­21 and I record my findings against each of them for the reasons stated below. I S S U E S F I N D I N G S 1.Whether the claimants prove that deceased Bhagwan Bhausaheb Kharad died in a motor accident held on 11.03.2015 ? .. Yes. 2.Whether the claimants prove that respondent No.1 was driving Tata ACE bearing No.MH­20­DE­2398 [ 5] M.A.C.P.No.299/2015, [Judgment]. in a rash and negligent manner and gave dash to the motorcycle bearing No.MH­20­BG­0474 of deceased from backside because of which the accident occurred ? .. Yes. 3.Whether claimants are entitle for compensation, if yes, to what extent and from whom ? .. Yes, Rs.17,65,679/­from respondent No.1 to 3 jointly & severally @ 7% per annum. 4.What order & award ? .. As per final order. R E A S O N S 10.In order to substantiate the contentions raised in the petition, claimant No.1 Alka Bhagwan Kharad deposed before this court as CW1 by filing her affidavit of evidence at Exh­27 and also examined Nitish Kumar Satish Vyas at Exh­41. Claimant has also placed on record certified copies of relevant police papers pertaining to the accident in question. They are FIR at Exh­29, Report at Exh­28, Spot Panchanama at Exh­30, Form Compound­AA at Exh­31, Postmortem Report at Exh­32, Driving License of respondent No.1 at Exh­33, Registration Certificate of offending vehicle at Exh­34, Insurance Policy of offending vehicle at Exh­35, Fitness Certificate of offending vehicle at Exh­36, Form T.C. At Exh­37, School Leaving Certificate of deceased at Exh­43, Attendance Register of Matrix Fine Science Private Ltd. at Exh­45, Pass Book of deceased of Bank of Maharashtra at Exh­38, Salary Slip at Exh­44 and filed [ 6] M.A.C.P.No.299/2015, [Judgment]. evidence closed Pursis at Exh­47. 11.Respondent No.1 & 2 did not lead any evidence and filed evidence close Pursis at Exh­48. 12.Respondent No.3 failed to adduce any evidence, hence their evidence was closed vide order dated 05.01.2015. 13.Heard Learned advocate Shri S.K.Hivale for the claimants. Shri Jagdish Rathod Advocate for respondent No.1 & 2, and Shri K.A.Bankar Advocate for respondent No.3. As to Issue No.1 & 2 : 14.The Learned advocate appearing for claimants submitted that police papers pertaining to the accident in question clearly indicates that respondent No.1 was driving Tata ACE bearing registration No.MH­20­DE­2398 in rash and negligent manner and gave dash to the motorcycle bearing registration No.MH­ 20­BG­0474 of deceased from backside and caused death of deceased Bhagwan Bhausaheb Kharad. He further submitted that respondent No.2 is the owner of offending Tata ACE and the same was insured with respondent No.3. Therefore, they are vicariously liable to pay for negligency of their driver i.e. respondent No.1. 15.Respondent No.3 submitted that perusal of spot panchanama at Exh­30 filed by the claimants shows that the front portion of the motorcycle [ 7] M.A.C.P.No.299/2015, [Judgment]. bearing registration No.MH­20­BG­0474 was damaged. The claimant has contended that the offending vehicle has given dash to the motorcycle from backside and the motorcycle was not damaged from backside which clearly established that the alleged accident has occurred because of negligency of the deceased. He further submitted that the police papers on record does not show that the deceased was wearing helmet while driving his motorcycle at the time of accident. He further submitted that if the deceased was wearing the helmet, it would have prevented the impact of the accident. Therefore, the facts on record shows that the deceased was not wearing helmet therefore, he is also contributory to the accident and relied upon the judgment passed by the Hon'ble High Court of Kerla in Siby Paul Vs Praveen Kumar G.N. Reported in 2008 CJ (Ker) 431 and submitted that the accident has not occurred because of negligency of respondent No.1. 16.It is seen that on 11.3.2015 deceased sustained injuries in motor accident and died on the same day. The cause of death given in Postmortem Report at Exh­32 is “Hemorrhage due to multiple Neurogenic shock, due to multiple injuries of head, chest and other parts of body, rupture of multiple organ in TRA”. 17.It is seen from the testimony of CW1, the copy of report at Exh­28, FIR at Exh­29 and Spot Panchanama at Exh­30 that the respondent No.1 was [ 8] M.A.C.P.No.299/2015, [Judgment]. driving Tata ACE bearing registration No. MH­20­DE­2398 in rash and negligent manner. The respondent No.1 driver of offending vehicle Tata ACE has not stepped into witness box so as to rebut the testimony of CW1 and the documents filed by the claimants. The submission of Learned advocate for respondent No.3 that the deceased was negligent in driving his vehicle does not find any support on the evidence on record. Hence, I answer Issue No.1 & 2 as 'Yes'. As to Issue No.3 : 18.CW1 in her deposition has stated that her husband was working in Matrix Fine Science Private Ltd., MIDC, Paithan District Aurangabad as electrician and was earning salary of Rs.11,835/­ per month. CW2 the Accountant in Matrix Fine Science Private Ltd. has deposed that the deceased Bhagwan Bhausaheb Kharad was working in their company as electrician. He was appointed in their company on 20.3.2014 and was earning gross salary of Rs.11,835/­. He further deposed that the salary of said deceased was paid in his bank account and the deceased was employed in their company because he was holding I.T.I. Diploma in electrician. The salary certificate filed at Exh­44 shows that the deceased was getting net salary of Rs.8,911/­ per month. The bank pass book at Exh­38 shows that salary for the month of February was credited in the bank account of the deceased. Therefore, it will be proper to take Rs.8,911/­ as income of the deceased. Therefore, the annual income of deceased will be [ 9] M.A.C.P.No.299/2015, [Judgment]. Rs.8,911 X 12 Months = Rs.1,06,932/­. It appears from the record that the deceased was having five dependents at the time of accident. Therefore, 1/4th of his annual income is deducted as his personal expenses. His annual earning after deduction will come to Rs.80,199/­. CW1 has deposed that the age of deceased was 40 years at the time of accident. To prove the age of deceased, the claimants have filed School Leaving Certificate of deceased at Exh­43. The date of birth mentioned in the school leaving certificate of the deceased is 12.7.1972. The accident has taken place on 11.3.2015. Therefore, the age of deceased at the time of accident was 43 years. Hence, the multiplier of 14 is applied as per the guidelines issued by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Smt. Sarla Verma Vs Delhi Transportation Corporation and another reported in AIR 2009 (SC) 3104. Therefore, the loss of dependency comes to Rs.11,22,786/­. 19.The Hon'ble Apex Court in Rajesh & Ors. Vs Rajbir Singh & Ors. Reported in 2013 (9) SCC 54 has held that “death of persons who are self employed or persons with fixed wages should be given future prospectus”. The age of deceased as per Exh­43 was 43 years at the time of accident. Therefore, 30% of loss of dependency is taken as future prospectus i.e. Rs.3,36,836/­. 20.It appears from the police papers filed on record that the deceased was not wearing helmet at the time of accident. The deceased was not responsible for the accident but if he had been wearing helmet, it would have [ 10] M.A.C.P.No.299/2015, [Judgment]. reduced the impact of the accident. Therefore, it would be proper in the present case to deduct 15% from the loss of dependency and future earning amount as contributory of the deceased towards the accident. Therefore, an amount of Rs.2,18,943/­ is deducted from total loss of dependency of deceased. 21.The claimant No.1 has lost her husband, therefore, she is entitle to an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ towards consortium. The claimant No.1 is also entitle for an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ towards loss of estate as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kalpanaraj & Ors. Vs Tamilnadu State Transport Corporation reported in 2014 (5) Scale 479 . The claimant No.2 & 3 have lost their father, therefore, they are entitle for Rs.1,00,000/­ each towards lost of love and affection as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Juju Kuruvila & Ors. Vs Kunjujamma Mohan & Others reported in (2013) 9 S.C.C. 166 . The claimant No.4 & 5 have lost their son, therefore, they are entitle for Rs.50,000/­ each towards love and affection of their deceased son as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in M. Mansoor and Anr. Vs United India Insurance Co.Ltd., reported in 2013 12 Scale 324 . 22.The claimants are further entitle to an amount of Rs.25,000/­ towards funeral expenses of deceased. Therefore, the claimants are entitle to total compensation of Rs.17,65,679/­. 23.The claimants have received Rs.50,000/­ towards interim compensation under the head of 'No Fault Liability'. Therefore, it will be [ 11] M.A.C.P.No.299/2015, [Judgment]. appropriate to deduct the said amount from total compensation. After deducting the amount of interim compensation, an amount of Rs. 17,15,679/­. 24.It is seen from Exh­28, 29, 30, 31 & 35 that the offending vehicle was owned by respondent No.2 and insured with respondent No.3. In such circumstances, respondent No.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to claimants for the death of deceased. 25.So far as rate of interest is concern, considering the period of pendency of matter and the amount of compensation, interest @ 7% per annum from the date of petition, till realization of compensation amount would meet the ends of justice. Hence, I answer issue No.3 accordingly and pass the following order. O R D E R 1.The petition is partly allowed. 2.Claimant No.1 to 5 are entitle to get compensation of Rs.17,65,679/­ inclusive of No Fault Liability. 3.Respondent No.1 to 3 do pay an amount of 17,15,679/­ exclusive of 'No Fault Liability' amount to claimant No.1 to 5, towards compensation jointly and severally, along with 7% interest per annum, from the date of filing of petition, till realization of entire amount. 4.The amount of 17,15,679/­ be appropriated amongst claimant No.1 to 5 as under­ i)Claimant No.1 Rs.4,43,139/­. ii)Claimant No.2 & 3 Rs.3,43,135/­ each. iii)Claimant No.4 & 5 Rs. 2,93,135/­ each. [ 12] M.A.C.P.No.299/2015, [Judgment]. 5.Out of compensation amount payable to claimant No.1, an amount of Rs.2,25,000/­ be invested in Fixed Deposit in her name, in any Nationalized Bank, for the period of two years and remaining amount be paid to her by account payee cheque, on identification. 6.Compensation amount payable to claimant No.2 & 3 be fixed in their names, in any Nationalized Bank, till they attains majority and the claimant No1 is at liberty to receive the interest on fixed deposit quarterly, if she desire so. 7.Out of compensation amount payable to claimant No.4 & 5, an amount of Rs.1,25,000/­ each be invested in Fixed Deposit in their name, in any Nationalized Bank, for the period of one year and remaining amount be paid to them by account payee cheque, on identification. 8.Respondent No.1 to 3 do pay jointly and severally proportionate cost of the petition to the claimants and bear their own cost. 9.Award be drawn accordingly.

Shinde, Advocate for respondent No.3. __________________________________________________ J U D G M E N T (Delivered on 27.02.2020) 1.The claimants are married daughters of deceased Narmadabai Ramesh Jadhav have filed this claim for compensation under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 for accidental death of deceased. 2.The facts emerge from claim petition are that, Narmadabai Ramesh Jadhav was working as domestic helper was proceeding towards Samarthnagar from her work. On the way from Savarkar chowk to Vivekanand College, she met with an accident at about 12.30 hours. One motorcycle bearing No. MH­20­CA­2987 gave dash to her in rash and negligent manner from front side. Narmadabai sustained grievous injuries. People present there had shifted her to the Govt. Medical College and Hospital Aurangabad. The driver of offending vehicle fled away from the spot. It is contention of the claimant that pillion rider of motorcycle also got injuries in the said 3 MACP No. 553/2015 (Judgment) accident and she was shifted to the Government hospital in the same auto in which injured Narmadabai was carried. It is alleged that due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle, the accident arose. MLC no. R­104/15 was registered on the day of accident. After getting information from elder brother of deceased, her cousin brother Sachin Bankar informed about the accident to police authorities and FIR came to be registered. The spot of incident was inspected by police on 23.3.2019, statements of witnesses were recorded. After investigation, crime No. 152/2015 U/s. 304A, 279, 337, 338 of IPC was registered against driver of offending vehicle Ramesh Bhisan Shinde who was arrested on 23.3.2015. 3.The claimants made claim that deceased was 43 years old was earning Rs.8000/­ to Rs.10,000/­ per month. She was only karta in the family as her husband predeceased her. Deceased could have survived for 60 years and would have earned more money for children. Due to accident, claimant have to suffer loss of their loving mother which could not be compensated in terms of money as the mother was only elder member of the family to look after them. Earlier in claim petition, son of deceased Shankar Ramesh Jadhav was claimant but during pendency of claim petition, he died. My learned Predecessor had passed order below Exh.45 on 29.6.2019 for addition of claimant namely Monika Balu Salve, 4 MACP No. 553/2015 (Judgment) married daughter of deceased. The claimants restricted their claim to Rs.8,00,000/­ only at the interest of 9% per annum and cost of proceeding of Rs.10,000/­. 4.Respondent nos. 1 and 2 driver and owner of offending vehicle appeared but did not file written statement hence, matter proceeded without W.S. against them by order dated 4.2.2015. Respondent no.3 Insurance Company United India Insurance Company filed its say vide Exh.18 and denied the occurrence of accident and involvement of offending vehicle and the facts of the claim that deceased was only earning member and was getting monthly income of Rs.8000/­ to Rs.10,000/. Further, the negligence on the part of deceased was stated to be caused of accident occurred and therefore, respondent no. 3 insurance company is not liable to pay the compensation to the claimant. The grounds that, driver of offending vehicle was not holding proper, valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident which gave rise to breach the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. The additional grounds of written statement are non compliance of Section 158(3) of M.V.Act by police authorities, permission sought to defend the claim without prejudiced to the provisions of Section 147 and 149 of M.V.Act as of mandate U/s.170 of the Act. 5.The learned Advocate for respondent no.3 vehemently argued that on perusal of police papers i.e. FIR, spot panchnama and 5 MACP No. 553/2015 (Judgment) other documents, involvement of motorcycle bearing no. MH­20­CA­ 2897 has not been disclosed as initially the offence was registered against driver of unknown vehicle­ motorcycle. Therefore, its involvement is doubtful. The delay of three days for lodging FIR dated 23.3.2015 for occurrence of accident dated 20.3.2015 cast doubt on truthfulness of the alleged accident. 6.In view of the rival submissions of the parties following issues are framed at Exh.19. I have recorded my findings against them for the reasons stated below : ISSUESFINDINGS 1.Do petitioners prove that death of Narmadabai Ramesh Jadhav occurred due to motor vehicular accident ? :In the affirmative. 2.Do petitioners further prove that accident occurred on 20.03.2015 at about 12.30 pm because of rash and negligent driving of motorcycle TVS Star City bearing no. MH­ 20­CA­2987 by opponent no.2 ?:In the affirmative. 3.Are petitioners entitled for getting compensation ? If yes, up to what extent ?:Yes, Rs.7,00,000/­ 4.What order ? :As per final order. R E A S O N S 7.AS TO ISSUE NO.1 :­ Claimant Bharati Ramesh Jadhav 6 MACP No. 553/2015 (Judgment) adduced her evidence on affidavit vide Exh.22 in support of claim and reiterated the contents of claim petition that, respondent nos. 1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay amount of compensation along with interest @12% per annum from the date of accident till its actual realisation. In cross­examination of claimant Bharati, she denied all the material suggestions as to non occurrence of accident and non involvement of offending vehicle in the accident and challenge to the earnings of her mother. She also admitted that she is married and her husband is labourer who look after her and that she has not filed original Form AA on record. 8.Certified copies of documents i.e. FIR of accident (Exh.31), spot panchnama (Exh.32), memorandum of postmortem examination (Exh.33), registration certificate of motorcycle (Exh.34), copy of R.C.Book (Exh.35), Form AA (Exh.40). Perusal of these documents reveals that, crime No. 52/2015 was registered on 23.3.2015 about accident occurred on 20.3.2015 against the driver of two wheeler vehicle. It is specifically mentioned in FIR that “ ददचचकक चचलकचचच पतच मचहहतत नचहत.” however, two mobile numbers are mentioned in the column. 9.The cousin brother of claimant had informed about the accident after getting receipt of information of accident dated 20.3.2015, he rushed to Aurangabad from Mumbai and lodged the report wherein, in clear terms, it has mentioned that, registration 7 MACP No. 553/2015 (Judgment) number of said motorcycle is not known and the driver has not stopped the vehicle after giving dash to deceased and one rickshaw driver namely Ramesh Kisanrao who had shifted the deceased in his auto rickshaw to the hospital had disclosed that he also shifted the injured pillion rider of the offending vehicle and had got mobile number of relative and the rider of said motorcycle. After investigation, accused rider of motorcycle TVS Star City bearing no. MH­20­CA­2987 was chargesheet. In cross­examination of claimant except suggestion and its denial nothing available which could support the arguments of learned Advocate of Insurance Company that offending vehicle was not at all involved in accident. 10.The statement filed along with copy of chargesheet of Ramesh Kisanrao Gajakwar reveals that he had not witnessed the incident, his rickshaw was stopped at Savarkar chowk and injured Narmadabai and pillion rider of motorcycle MH­20­CA­2897 namely Usha Suresh was shifted to Ghati Hospital Aurangabad. His statement was recorded on 26.3.2015. This corroborates with the involvement of offending vehicle though the at first instance neither the name of vehicle number and name of rider was mentioned in FIR, but the fact of occurrence of accident dated 20.3.2013 is not challenged. Under such facts and circumstances, as a strict proof of evidence is not applicable to determine the compensation. The claimant with the documents on record had proved the involvement of the offending vehicle in the accident. 8 MACP No. 553/2015 (Judgment) 11.The occurrence of accident and involvement of the offending vehicle is made out. Therefore, rash and negligent act of respondent no.2, the driver of the offending vehicle, can not be denied. The accidental injuries was possible for causing death of deceased. The offending vehicle was insured with respondent no.3. The insurance policy of offending vehicle bearing no.2307003114P107536508 was valid from 15.12.2014 to 14.12.2015. The defence of contributory negligence is not supported with proof. The claimants have proved that deceased Narmadabai died in the accident which was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.2. Therefore, I answer Issue nos. 1 and 2 in the affirmative. 12.AS TO ISSUE NO. 3 :­ In National Insurance Company Limited vs. Pranay Sethi & Ors 2017 CJ(SC) 1226, the Hon'ble Aped Court in regard to the term of just compensation had settled that it does not mean perfect or absolute compensation. Mainly it requires examination of the particular situation obtaining uniquely in an individual case. Therefore, the entitlement of the married daughters in present case in hand for the compensation in the death claim of their mother requires evaluation of the facts and circumstances of the present case. 13.At first stage, claimants in this regard relied on the Judgment of Hon'ble Madras High Court in case of M. Kavitha vs. G. 9 MACP No. 553/2015 (Judgment) Murugan, 1 June 2017 , wherein, the Hon'ble High Court dealt with question (1) Whether claim for compensation can be declined on the ground that the married daughters are not dependents ?, (2) Whether the compensation should be awarded under the statutory liability ?, (3) Whether compensation should be awarded can not be less than the compensation under statutory liability?. In answer to these questions, factum laid down in Manjuri Bela's case is referred, “ the legal representative is one who suffer on account of the death of a person due to motor vehicle accident and need not necessarily be wife, husband, parents and child.” Further the observations in reference to the expression legal representatives and persons covered by it, in case of Gujarat State Road Transporation vs. Ramanbhai Prabhatbhai and another (1987) 3 SCR 402 . ""the crux of the judgment is that, even if there is no loss of dependency, the claimant if he or she is a legal representative, will be entitled to compensation, the quantum of which shall not be less than the liability following from section 140 of the Act. Therefore, it does not mean that when there is evidence available to show the extent of contribution of the deceased to the estate of the deceased the beneficiaries of the estate of the deceased can claim compensation, after adducing necessary proof.” The Hon'ble Madras High Court in this background had held that, “The dependency of a daughter need not always be financial dependency, but it can also be any other dependency like physical dependency, moral dependency, emotional 10 MACP No. 553/2015 (Judgment) dependency, psychological dependency etc. The law recognizes not only parameters which can be arithmetically calculated, but also other parameters which can be notionally estimated. Say for example, loss of enjoyment of amenities and loss of expectation of life, for which there is no numerical calculations readily available.” Further the Hon'ble High Court in consideration of compulsion of the married woman to seek assistance from their parents being the primary provider for domestic and child care responsibilities it has observed that, “ Grandparents, the deceased person (if the claimants beget children in their married life) would have played an important role in taking up the responsibility of taking care of their grandchildren, Grand parents are the major providers of child care for preschool children, particularly for babies and toddlers, when both their parents are in the workforce.” “ Moreover, when there is a liability for the married daughters to maintain the parents under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, then there is no reason as to why they should be deprived of the benefits emanating on account of death of their parents.” The Hon'ble Court of the view that, so far as the mother is concerned, her services which she should have rendered in house hold responsibilities and other services to the married daughters, have to be calculated towards loss to estate. 11 MACP No. 553/2015 (Judgment) 14.In these background, the present claimants who have lost their mother though are married, had certainly suffered loss and damage due to sudden death of their mother as they were deprived of love and affection, support moral as well as financial loss and her company. The loss of mother even for a married daughter is lifelong trauma only because the daughters are married, the loss of mother can not be scaled down. The fact that, they were not dependent on the deceased as they were married and residing with their husband. But in view of ratio of cited case supra, they are entitled for compensation for the loss of their mother. 15.The next question needs to be determined t he concept of just compensation from the point of view of prism of fairness, reasonableness and non­violation of principles of equality, its determination and calculations should be on the foundation of evidence brought on record as regards to age and income of deceased and after application of apposite multiplier, with regard to the future prospect to the income for its purpose and medical expenses and the compensation under the conventional head. 16. The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of Sarla Verma and others vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another, AIR 2009 Supreme Court 3104 , laid down that this Tribunal is bound to determine compensation in cases of death by following three steps i.e. ascertaining the multiplicand, the multiplier and actual calculation. 12 MACP No. 553/2015 (Judgment) 17.To find out the multiplicand, nothing is placed on record except bare words that deceased was earning Rs.8,000/­ to Rs.10,000/­ per month from domestic labour work. In such case, notional income of deceased is to be ascertained. The accident was occurred in the year 2015. Generally the domestic servant could work in a day near about 4 to 5 house holds for helping, cleaning, washing of utensils, clothes, house. The deceased might have getting Rs.400/­ for each of the work even if it is assumed that she was helping for household work of five families, at least doing two household jobs in each house, she might be earning Rs.400/­ for each job. Thus, she might have earning Rs.4000/­ per month. Thus, notional income of deceased, a domestic helper could be ascertained @ Rs.4,000/­ per month. 18.The age of deceased is not proved on record by way of filing documentary evidence. However, police record and postmortem report (Exh.43), the age of deceased is not challenged seriously. There is no impediment to rely medical opinion as to the age of deceased. This Tribunal is duty bound to follow the doctrine of actual income at the time of death and to add amount with regard to future prospects to the income for the purpose of determination of just multiplicand. 19.The deceased was self­employed, she was between age group of 40 to 50, an addition of 25% of the established income of 13 MACP No. 553/2015 (Judgment) the deceased towards future prospectus will be just and proper as per ratio of Pranay Sethi's case. The total dependency after death of brother of claimant are the claimants Bharati and Monica. The calculated established income of deceased 4000 x 12 = 48,000/­ and its 25% is Rs.12,000/­. That brings multiplicand of 48,000+12,000= 60,000/­/ The calculated multiplicand of Rs.60,000/­ required to be deducted with 1/4th amount of total income towards personal expenses of deceased which comes Rs.15,000/­ per annum. Thus, the established income of deceased is calculated to the tune of Rs.45,000/­ per annum. 20.The deceased was of age group 41 to 45 therefore, as per Sarla Verma's case, the multiplier 14 is applicable. The claimants are entitled to get towards future loss of income Rs.45,000/­ x 14 = 6,30,000/­. 21.In consequences to the above calculation, the claimants are entitled for the compensation U/s. 166 of M.V.Act for Rs.6,30,000/­ towards future loss of income. In case of Pranay Sethi's case, the Hon'ble Apex Court has fixed the amount of compensation payable to the dependent under the conventional head as Rs.40,000/­ towards loss of consortium Rs.15,000/­ towards loss of estate and Rs.15,000/­ towards funeral expenses. Thus, the claimants are entitled to Rs.70,000/­ under conventional head. 14 MACP No. 553/2015 (Judgment) The total amount of compensation is Rs.7,00,000/­. The liability to pay the compensation amount is joint and several of respondent no.1 to 3. The offending vehicle was driven by respondent no.2 and it was owned by respondent no.1 and insured with respondent no.3. 22.In the year 2015, the rate of interest of the nationalized bank was 9% per annum therefore, the same rate of interest is payable on the amount of compensation awarded to the claimants from the date of filing of claim petition till actual realization of amount of compensation. During pendency of claim, the claimants have not pressed the application (Exh.5) U/s. 140 of the Act on 18.11.2016. Hence, I answer point no.3 accordingly, and proceed to pass following order. ORDER 1. Claim petition is allowed with proportionate costs against respondent nos.1 to 3 . 2.The claimants are entitled to get Rs.7,00,000/­ (Rs. Seven lakhs only). 3.Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 jointly and severally do pay Rs.7,00,000/­ (Rs.

Shinde, Advocate for respondent No.3. __________________________________________________ J U D G M E N T (Delivered on 27.02.2020) 1.The claimants are married daughters of deceased Narmadabai Ramesh Jadhav have filed this claim for compensation under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 for accidental death of deceased. 2.The facts emerge from claim petition are that, Narmadabai Ramesh Jadhav was working as domestic helper was proceeding towards Samarthnagar from her work. On the way from Savarkar chowk to Vivekanand College, she met with an accident at about 12.30 hours. One motorcycle bearing No. MH­20­CA­2987 gave dash to her in rash and negligent manner from front side. Narmadabai sustained grievous injuries. People present there had shifted her to the Govt. Medical College and Hospital Aurangabad. The driver of offending vehicle fled away from the spot. It is contention of the claimant that pillion rider of motorcycle also got injuries in the said 3 MACP No. 553/2015 (Judgment) accident and she was shifted to the Government hospital in the same auto in which injured Narmadabai was carried. It is alleged that due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle, the accident arose. MLC no. R­104/15 was registered on the day of accident. After getting information from elder brother of deceased, her cousin brother Sachin Bankar informed about the accident to police authorities and FIR came to be registered. The spot of incident was inspected by police on 23.3.2019, statements of witnesses were recorded. After investigation, crime No. 152/2015 U/s. 304A, 279, 337, 338 of IPC was registered against driver of offending vehicle Ramesh Bhisan Shinde who was arrested on 23.3.2015. 3.The claimants made claim that deceased was 43 years old was earning Rs.8000/­ to Rs.10,000/­ per month. She was only karta in the family as her husband predeceased her. Deceased could have survived for 60 years and would have earned more money for children. Due to accident, claimant have to suffer loss of their loving mother which could not be compensated in terms of money as the mother was only elder member of the family to look after them. Earlier in claim petition, son of deceased Shankar Ramesh Jadhav was claimant but during pendency of claim petition, he died. My learned Predecessor had passed order below Exh.45 on 29.6.2019 for addition of claimant namely Monika Balu Salve, 4 MACP No. 553/2015 (Judgment) married daughter of deceased. The claimants restricted their claim to Rs.8,00,000/­ only at the interest of 9% per annum and cost of proceeding of Rs.10,000/­. 4.Respondent nos. 1 and 2 driver and owner of offending vehicle appeared but did not file written statement hence, matter proceeded without W.S. against them by order dated 4.2.2015. Respondent no.3 Insurance Company United India Insurance Company filed its say vide Exh.18 and denied the occurrence of accident and involvement of offending vehicle and the facts of the claim that deceased was only earning member and was getting monthly income of Rs.8000/­ to Rs.10,000/. Further, the negligence on the part of deceased was stated to be caused of accident occurred and therefore, respondent no. 3 insurance company is not liable to pay the compensation to the claimant. The grounds that, driver of offending vehicle was not holding proper, valid and effective driving license at the time of alleged accident which gave rise to breach the terms and conditions of the insurance policy. The additional grounds of written statement are non compliance of Section 158(3) of M.V.Act by police authorities, permission sought to defend the claim without prejudiced to the provisions of Section 147 and 149 of M.V.Act as of mandate U/s.170 of the Act. 5.The learned Advocate for respondent no.3 vehemently argued that on perusal of police papers i.e. FIR, spot panchnama and 5 MACP No. 553/2015 (Judgment) other documents, involvement of motorcycle bearing no. MH­20­CA­ 2897 has not been disclosed as initially the offence was registered against driver of unknown vehicle­ motorcycle. Therefore, its involvement is doubtful. The delay of three days for lodging FIR dated 23.3.2015 for occurrence of accident dated 20.3.2015 cast doubt on truthfulness of the alleged accident. 6.In view of the rival submissions of the parties following issues are framed at Exh.19. I have recorded my findings against them for the reasons stated below : ISSUESFINDINGS 1.Do petitioners prove that death of Narmadabai Ramesh Jadhav occurred due to motor vehicular accident ? :In the affirmative. 2.Do petitioners further prove that accident occurred on 20.03.2015 at about 12.30 pm because of rash and negligent driving of motorcycle TVS Star City bearing no. MH­ 20­CA­2987 by opponent no.2 ?:In the affirmative. 3.Are petitioners entitled for getting compensation ? If yes, up to what extent ?:Yes, Rs.7,00,000/­ 4.What order ? :As per final order. R E A S O N S 7.AS TO ISSUE NO.1 :­ Claimant Bharati Ramesh Jadhav 6 MACP No. 553/2015 (Judgment) adduced her evidence on affidavit vide Exh.22 in support of claim and reiterated the contents of claim petition that, respondent nos. 1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay amount of compensation along with interest @12% per annum from the date of accident till its actual realisation. In cross­examination of claimant Bharati, she denied all the material suggestions as to non occurrence of accident and non involvement of offending vehicle in the accident and challenge to the earnings of her mother. She also admitted that she is married and her husband is labourer who look after her and that she has not filed original Form AA on record. 8.Certified copies of documents i.e. FIR of accident (Exh.31), spot panchnama (Exh.32), memorandum of postmortem examination (Exh.33), registration certificate of motorcycle (Exh.34), copy of R.C.Book (Exh.35), Form AA (Exh.40). Perusal of these documents reveals that, crime No. 52/2015 was registered on 23.3.2015 about accident occurred on 20.3.2015 against the driver of two wheeler vehicle. It is specifically mentioned in FIR that “ ददचचकक चचलकचचच पतच मचहहतत नचहत.” however, two mobile numbers are mentioned in the column. 9.The cousin brother of claimant had informed about the accident after getting receipt of information of accident dated 20.3.2015, he rushed to Aurangabad from Mumbai and lodged the report wherein, in clear terms, it has mentioned that, registration 7 MACP No. 553/2015 (Judgment) number of said motorcycle is not known and the driver has not stopped the vehicle after giving dash to deceased and one rickshaw driver namely Ramesh Kisanrao who had shifted the deceased in his auto rickshaw to the hospital had disclosed that he also shifted the injured pillion rider of the offending vehicle and had got mobile number of relative and the rider of said motorcycle. After investigation, accused rider of motorcycle TVS Star City bearing no. MH­20­CA­2987 was chargesheet. In cross­examination of claimant except suggestion and its denial nothing available which could support the arguments of learned Advocate of Insurance Company that offending vehicle was not at all involved in accident. 10.The statement filed along with copy of chargesheet of Ramesh Kisanrao Gajakwar reveals that he had not witnessed the incident, his rickshaw was stopped at Savarkar chowk and injured Narmadabai and pillion rider of motorcycle MH­20­CA­2897 namely Usha Suresh was shifted to Ghati Hospital Aurangabad. His statement was recorded on 26.3.2015. This corroborates with the involvement of offending vehicle though the at first instance neither the name of vehicle number and name of rider was mentioned in FIR, but the fact of occurrence of accident dated 20.3.2013 is not challenged. Under such facts and circumstances, as a strict proof of evidence is not applicable to determine the compensation. The claimant with the documents on record had proved the involvement of the offending vehicle in the accident. 8 MACP No. 553/2015 (Judgment) 11.The occurrence of accident and involvement of the offending vehicle is made out. Therefore, rash and negligent act of respondent no.2, the driver of the offending vehicle, can not be denied. The accidental injuries was possible for causing death of deceased. The offending vehicle was insured with respondent no.3. The insurance policy of offending vehicle bearing no.2307003114P107536508 was valid from 15.12.2014 to 14.12.2015. The defence of contributory negligence is not supported with proof. The claimants have proved that deceased Narmadabai died in the accident which was occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.2. Therefore, I answer Issue nos. 1 and 2 in the affirmative. 12.AS TO ISSUE NO. 3 :­ In National Insurance Company Limited vs. Pranay Sethi & Ors 2017 CJ(SC) 1226, the Hon'ble Aped Court in regard to the term of just compensation had settled that it does not mean perfect or absolute compensation. Mainly it requires examination of the particular situation obtaining uniquely in an individual case. Therefore, the entitlement of the married daughters in present case in hand for the compensation in the death claim of their mother requires evaluation of the facts and circumstances of the present case. 13.At first stage, claimants in this regard relied on the Judgment of Hon'ble Madras High Court in case of M. Kavitha vs. G. 9 MACP No. 553/2015 (Judgment) Murugan, 1 June 2017 , wherein, the Hon'ble High Court dealt with question (1) Whether claim for compensation can be declined on the ground that the married daughters are not dependents ?, (2) Whether the compensation should be awarded under the statutory liability ?, (3) Whether compensation should be awarded can not be less than the compensation under statutory liability?. In answer to these questions, factum laid down in Manjuri Bela's case is referred, “ the legal representative is one who suffer on account of the death of a person due to motor vehicle accident and need not necessarily be wife, husband, parents and child.” Further the observations in reference to the expression legal representatives and persons covered by it, in case of Gujarat State Road Transporation vs. Ramanbhai Prabhatbhai and another (1987) 3 SCR 402 . ""the crux of the judgment is that, even if there is no loss of dependency, the claimant if he or she is a legal representative, will be entitled to compensation, the quantum of which shall not be less than the liability following from section 140 of the Act. Therefore, it does not mean that when there is evidence available to show the extent of contribution of the deceased to the estate of the deceased the beneficiaries of the estate of the deceased can claim compensation, after adducing necessary proof.” The Hon'ble Madras High Court in this background had held that, “The dependency of a daughter need not always be financial dependency, but it can also be any other dependency like physical dependency, moral dependency, emotional 10 MACP No. 553/2015 (Judgment) dependency, psychological dependency etc. The law recognizes not only parameters which can be arithmetically calculated, but also other parameters which can be notionally estimated. Say for example, loss of enjoyment of amenities and loss of expectation of life, for which there is no numerical calculations readily available.” Further the Hon'ble High Court in consideration of compulsion of the married woman to seek assistance from their parents being the primary provider for domestic and child care responsibilities it has observed that, “ Grandparents, the deceased person (if the claimants beget children in their married life) would have played an important role in taking up the responsibility of taking care of their grandchildren, Grand parents are the major providers of child care for preschool children, particularly for babies and toddlers, when both their parents are in the workforce.” “ Moreover, when there is a liability for the married daughters to maintain the parents under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, then there is no reason as to why they should be deprived of the benefits emanating on account of death of their parents.” The Hon'ble Court of the view that, so far as the mother is concerned, her services which she should have rendered in house hold responsibilities and other services to the married daughters, have to be calculated towards loss to estate. 11 MACP No. 553/2015 (Judgment) 14.In these background, the present claimants who have lost their mother though are married, had certainly suffered loss and damage due to sudden death of their mother as they were deprived of love and affection, support moral as well as financial loss and her company. The loss of mother even for a married daughter is lifelong trauma only because the daughters are married, the loss of mother can not be scaled down. The fact that, they were not dependent on the deceased as they were married and residing with their husband. But in view of ratio of cited case supra, they are entitled for compensation for the loss of their mother. 15.The next question needs to be determined t he concept of just compensation from the point of view of prism of fairness, reasonableness and non­violation of principles of equality, its determination and calculations should be on the foundation of evidence brought on record as regards to age and income of deceased and after application of apposite multiplier, with regard to the future prospect to the income for its purpose and medical expenses and the compensation under the conventional head. 16.

This Tribunal is duty bound to follow the doctrine of actual income at the time of death and to add amount with regard to future prospects to the income for the purpose of determination of just multiplicand. 19.The deceased was self­employed, she was between age group of 40 to 50, an addition of 25% of the established income of 13 MACP No. 553/2015 (Judgment) the deceased towards future prospectus will be just and proper as per ratio of Pranay Sethi's case. The total dependency after death of brother of claimant are the claimants Bharati and Monica. The calculated established income of deceased 4000 x 12 = 48,000/­ and its 25% is Rs.12,000/­. That brings multiplicand of 48,000+12,000= 60,000/­/ The calculated multiplicand of Rs.60,000/­ required to be deducted with 1/4th amount of total income towards personal expenses of deceased which comes Rs.15,000/­ per annum. Thus, the established income of deceased is calculated to the tune of Rs.45,000/­ per annum. 20.The deceased was of age group 41 to 45 therefore, as per Sarla Verma's case, the multiplier 14 is applicable. The claimants are entitled to get towards future loss of income Rs.45,000/­ x 14 = 6,30,000/­. 21.In consequences to the above calculation, the claimants are entitled for the compensation U/s. 166 of M.V.Act for Rs.6,30,000/­ towards future loss of income.

JUDGMENT ( Delivered on 29­08­2018 ) 1] This is an application under section 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, claiming compensation on account of death of Akash Dilip Nikam in motor accident on 08­05­2015 on Aurangabad Phulambri Road near Maula Ali Dargah involving Innova Car bearing No.MH­42­K­2294. 2]Applicant no.1 Anita is mother and applicant no.2 Dilip is father of deceased Akash. 3]In short, the case of applicants is that, on 08.05.2015, Akash Dilip Nikam was proceeding as a pillion rider on motorcycle bearing no.MH­20­DG­5772 driven by his uncle, namely, Vilas Sheshrao Nikam from Wanegaon towards Aurangabad. When he reached near Maula Ali Dargah at about 01.00 p.m on Aurangabad­Phulambri Road, one Innova Car bearing No.MH­42­K­2294 driven by respondent no.1 came from Aurangabad towards Phulambri in a high speed and rashly and negligently and gave dash to the said motorcycle due to which Akash sustained multiple injuries on several parts of his body. The 3 [MACP 409/2015 [J] injured was immediately shifted to Apex Hospital, Aurangabad. He died on the same day. His body was sent to Government Medical College & Hospital (Ghati), Aurangabad where postmortem was conducted. On the basis of report lodged by Vilas Sheshrao Nikam with Police Station, Phulambri, PSO registered an offence vide Crime no.79/2015 for offences u/S.279, 304­A, 337, 338 of IPC against respondent no.1. Spot panchanama was drawn up. Inquest was held on dead body of the deceased at Govt. Medical College & Hospital, Aurangabad. The cause of death was “Head injury with multiple long bones fractures”. 4]According to applicants, the deceased was aged about 17 years and had passed 12th Standard Examiantion and apart from education, he was doing private service and was earning more than Rs.6,000/­ per month and was supplying milk to milk dairy and was earning Rs.3,000/­ per month. In all, the deceased used to earn Rs.9,000/­ per month and was maintaining his family. Applicants state that they were depending upon the income of deceased Akash. 5]Applicants have claimed sum of Rs.29,50,000/­ (Rupees Twenty Nine lacs Fifty thousand only) under all permissible heads by way of compensation. 6]Respondent no.1 and 2 filed their written statement at Exh­12 and thereby denied all adverse allegations made against 4 [MACP 409/2015 [J] them. Respondents contended that, Innova Car bearing No.MH­ 42­K­2294 has no concerned with the alleged accident. Innova Car bearing No.MH­42­K­2294 is validly insured with respondent no.3 and therefore, if any liability is fixed on these respondents, the same may be recovered from respondent no.3. They lastly prayed for dismissal of claim petition. 7]Respondent no.3 Insurance Company filed its Written Statement vide Exh­08 and thereby denied all adverse allegations made against it. Respondent no.3 denied occurrence of accident due to rash and negligent driving of Innova Car bearing No.MH­ 42­K­2294. According to this respondent, uncle of the deceased, namely, Vilas Sheshrao Nikam was driving the vehicle without following traffic rules and not having driving license and due to the negligence of the uncle of deceased, the accident occurred. It is a case of contributory negligence and therefore, this respondent is not liable to pay compensation to the claimants. The Insurance Company submitted that, the accident occurred because of negligence of the uncle of deceased himself and therefore, the claim petition is liable to be dismissed for non­joinder of necessary parties. This respondent denied the service and monthly income of the deceased at Rs.9,000/­. He lastly prayed for dismissal of the claim petition. 5 [MACP 409/2015 [J] 8]My Ld.Predecessor framed Issues vide Exh­19. Said Issues along with my findings and reasons thereon are as under : SR.No.ISSUES 1Whether claimants prove that, deceased Akash s/o.Dilip Nikam was dashed by respondent no.1 by driving Innova Car bearing No.MH­42­K­2294 rashly and negligently ? 2Whether claimants are entitled for compensation ? If yes, what is just and reasonable compensation ? 3From whom claimants are entitled to recover compensation and interest, if any ? 4What order ? My findings to the above issues for the reasons stated below are as under: Findings 1.Affirmative. 2. Yes, Rs.6,90,000/­ 3. From respondents no.1 to 3. 4. As per final order. REASONS AS TO ISSUE NO.1 AND 3 : 9]Heard Advocate for claimants as well as advocates of respondent no.1, 2 and 3 respectively. The claimants have examined applicant no.2 Dilip Sheshrao Nikam, father of deceased Akash, as PW­1 at Exh.20; Ramesh Namdeo Chhatre, Head 6 [MACP 409/2015 [J] Constable, Police Station, Phulamrbri as PW­2 at Exh36; Subhash Paroba Jadhav, milk man, as PW­3 at Exh­38. Copies of FIR, Spot Panchanama, Inquest Panchanama, Provisional Postmortem­Cum­ Provisional Cause of Death Certificate, Insurance Cover Note, Form Comp. 'AA', Final Report are at Exh­22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28 respectively. Xerox copies of Registration Certificate of Innova Car No.MH­42­K­2294 and Driving License of respondent no.1 Prakash Bhagwat Salvi are at Exh.4/5 and 4/6. Claimants filed Evidence Close Pursis vide Exh­42. 10]I have gone through entire oral as well as documentary evidence on record. Death of Akash Dilip Nikam occurred on 08.05.2015 in motor accident (Provisional Postmortem Report Exh­25 and Inquest Panchanama Exh.24) is not in dispute. Copies of RC Book Exh­4/5 and Insurance Cover note Exh­26 show, said Innova Car No.MH­42­K­2294 is standing in the name of respondent no.2 and it was insured from 27.12.2014 to 26.12.2015 with respondent no.3. Alleged accident took­place on 08­05­2015. It means, on the day of alleged accident said Innova Car No.MH­42­K­2294 was insured with respondent no.3 Insurance Company. There is no dispute about status of respondent no.1 as driver of the offending vehicle i.e. Innova Car No.MH­42­K­2294 . 11]Therefore, point in dispute remains only because of 7 [MACP 409/2015 [J] whose negligence alleged accident took­place. 12]As regard rash and negligent driving, in fact I have already mentioned that, Crime No.79/2015 is registered against driver of offending vehicle i.e. Innova Car No.MH­42­K­2294. Dilip (PW­1) also deposed about how the driver of offending vehicle i.e. Innova Car was rash and negligent. FIR Exh.22 and Spot Panchanama Exh.23 show reference of how the driver of offending vehicle i.e. Innova Car was rash and negligent at the time of alleged accident. Already Charge sheet is filed against the driver of offending vehicle i.e. Innova Car. In the light of all above discussion, it is clear that, alleged accident took­place because of rash and negligent driving at the hands of driver of offending vehicle i.e. Innova Car No.MH­42­K­2294. Therefore, I hold that, the accident in question occurred solely on account of negligent driving of the Innova Car in question by its driver i.e. respondent no.1, namely, Prakash Bhagwat Salvi. 13]In short, in the light of all above aspects, I hold that alleged accident took­place because of rash and negligent driving of driver of Innova Car No.MH­42­K­2294 . So, respondents no.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable for consequences of alleged accident. Therefore, I answer issue no. 1 and 3 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUES No.2 AND 4: 14]In view of my findings on issue no.1 and 3 above, it is 8 [MACP 409/2015 [J] clear that applicants are entitled to compensation. 15]As to the quantum, the principle of assessment in such cases is enunciated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sarla Varma and others vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another; 2009 ACJ 1298 (Supreme Court) , which have been approved by the full bench of Apex Court in the case of Reshmakumari and others vs. Madan Mohan and another. 2013 ACJ 1253 . In the case of National Insurance Company Limited vs. Pranay Sethi and others (Special Leave Petition Civil No.25590/2014 decided on 31/10/2017) the larger bench of Hon'ble Apex Court held that multiplier as per decision in Sarla Verma 2009 ACJ 1298 (SC) should be applied. 16]As regard age of deceased Akash, copies of Claim Petition Exh­1, Inquest Panchanama Exh­24 and Provisional Postmortem­cum­Death Certificate Exh­25 show the age of Akash as 17 years. Claimants have contended that, deceased Akash had passed XII Standard Examination. However, in support of their contention, they have not filed any document to show that, Akash had passed XII Standard Examination. Further, in Inquest Panchanama Exh­24 as well as Spot Panchanama Exh­23, age of Akash is shown as 17 years. So, on the day of accident, Akash was 17 years. So considering the guidelines in Sarla Verma case as mentioned above, the appropriate multiplier would be '18' for the 9 [MACP 409/2015 [J] age groups of 15 to 20 years. 17]In main petition Exh.1 as well as in examination in chief of PW­1 Dilip Exh.20, he has stated that deceased Akash was doing milk business and assisting him in agricultural work and was earning Rs.6,000/­ per month. So the annual income of deceased Akash will have to be assumed as Rs.6,000 X 12 = 72,000/­ per annum. Deceased Akash was bachelor. So, out of above annual income, ½ amount will have to be deducted as being the personal and living expenses of the deceased i.e. 72,000 – 36,000 = 36,000. The net dependency per annum would thus work out to Rs.36,000/­ X 18 = 6,48,000/­ (Rs. Eighty Six Lacs Forty Eight thousand only). So as regard loss of dependency, applicants are entitled to Rs. 6,48,000/­(Rs. Six lakhs Forty Eight thousand only). 21]In addition to loss of an amount of dependency, and in view of observations of the Hon'ble Apex Court in National Insurance Co.Ltd, vs. Pranay Sethi and others (Special Leave petition [Civil] no. 25590/2014 decided on 31/10/2017) claimants are entitled for the amount of Rs.15,000/­ ( Rupees fifteen thousand ) for loss of estate plus Rs.15,000/­ ( Rupees fifteen thousand ) as funeral expenses. So in all applicants are entitled to recover an amount of Rs.6,48,000 + 30,000 = 6,88,000/­ as rounded off Rs.6,90,000/­ (Rs. Six lakhs Ninety 10 [MACP 409/2015 [J] thousand only). 22]In short, in the light of all above discussion applicants are entitled to Rs.6,90,000 /­(Rs. Six lakhs Ninety thousand only) alongwith interest @ 9% since filing of petition till realization. Accordingly I answer issue no.2 in the affirmative and in answer to issue no.4, pass following order. ORDER 1.Application is partly allowed with cost. 2.The respondent no.1 to 3 shall jointly and/or severally pay sum of Rs.6,90,000/­(Rupees Six lakhs Ninety thousand only) inclusive of the NFL, to the applicants along with interest @ 9% p.a from the date of filing of the petition till realization of the amount. 3.Apportionment order is as under: a.Rs. 3,00,000/­( Rupees Three lakhs only ) shall be invested in the name of applicant no.1 Anita in any nationalized bank in fixed deposit for a period of three years. b. The balance together with the entire accrued interest shall be paid to applicant no.1 and 2 equally by account payee cheques duly crossed and drawn in their names. 4.The respondent no.1 to 3 are further directed to issue A/c payee cheque for investment in the name of applicant no.1 Anita by depositing the same in the Tribunal. 11 [MACP 409/2015 [J] 5.The Account officer/Nazir is directed to invest the said amount in the name of applicant no.1 Anita in any nationalized bank in the manner aforesaid and handover cheques to applicants no.1 and 2 by obtaining acknowledgment thereof. 6.

Mr A.R. Kawade, Advocate for Claimants. Petition proceeded Ex­parte against respondent Nos. 1 & 2 Mr R.S. Chandre, Advocate for Respondent No.3 ....................................................................................................... J U D G M E N T (Delivered in open court on 18/08/2017) This petition is filed by the claimants for grant of compensation of Rs. 15,00,000 /­ under Section 166 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. 2) Claimant's case in nutshell is as under :­ Claimants have alleged that an accident took place on 23.08.2014, when deceased Devidas Harishchandra Dolus was going by motorcycle bearing No. MH­20­CF­5255 with his firend from Hatnoor village towards Chalisgaon. At the time of accident, deceased was driving motorcycle. He was holding driving license. When he reached near Dhule T Point on Chalisgaon to Dhule By Pass Road at about 10.30 hours, at that time, one truck bearing No. HR­55­R­0211 came from offending side in high speed with rash and negligent manner and dashed to him. The truck was 3 [MACP No.138/2015] driving by respondent no.1. In the accident, deceased and his friend sustained serious injuries. 3)They have further contended that, immediately deceased was shifted to the Bapji Hospital Chalisgaon and thereafter, shifted to Saoji Orthopedic Hospital Aurangabad. He was admitted as indoor patient from 23.08.2014 to 03.09.2014. Thereafter, he was shifted to Max Super Speciality Hospital Aurangabad from 03.09.2014 to 22.09.2014. During treatment he expired on 22.09.2014. 4)They have further contended that, during treatment, he spent of Rs.8,00,000/­ towards hospital charges, doctor fees, medicine, transportation and other allied expenses. Thereafter, Chalisgaon Police Station has registered crime against truck driver under section 304­A, 279, 337, 338, 427 of I.P .C. The police has prepared spot and inquest panchanama. Medical Officer carried out postmortem. At the time of accident, deceased was doing agriculture and milk businesses. Out of that, he was getting of Rs.20,000/­ per month. But due to untimely death of deceased, the entire family is facing starvation. Claimant no.1 is wife and claimants no. 2 and 3 are sons of the deceased. At the time of accident, deceased was only 50 years old. 5)They further contended that, respondent no.1 is driver, respondent no.2 is registered owner and respondent no.3 is 4 Insurance Company of the truck. Therefore, all respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation. They lastly prayed compensation of Rs.15,00,000/­ with interest @ 18% p.a. be awarded. 6)Respondents no. 1 and 2 have been duly served summons vide Exh. 24 and 25 respectively. Inspite of that, they failed to appear. Thus, ex­parte order passed against them. 7)Respondent no.3 has filed written­statement vide Exh.15 and denied entire allegations. He has specifically contended that, truck bearing No. HR­55­R­0211 was insured with Insurance Company but rest of the contents are not correct. The driver of the truck was not holding license. He has committed breach of condition of policy. Therefore, company is not liable to pay compensation. The driver was not driving truck in rash and negligent manner. The speed of the truck was moderated. He has not committed any fault. The age of the deceased was more than 52 years. Moreover, claimants have not incurred Rs.8,00,000/­ for the medical expenses as alleged. On the contrary, accident occurred due to negligence of the deceased, because, he was driving motorcycle in rash and negligent manner. Police has registered crime against him without proper investigation. The claim is exorbitant. In all counts, claim deserves to be rejected. 5 [MACP No.138/2015] 8)From the rival pleadings of the parties, issues are framed vide Exh. 22 and I record my findings against each of them for the reasons given below:­ SR. NO.ISSUES FINDINGS 1)Whether the claimants prove that, the deceased died in the motor vehicular accident dated 22/09/2014 ?: In the Affirmative. 2)Whether the claimants prove that, the deceased died in the accident due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing No. HR­55­R­0211 ?: In the Affirmative. 3)What is just and reasonable amount of compensation ?: In the Affirmative. As per final order. 4)What order and Award? :As per final order. REASONS 9) The claimants are relied upon the following documents:­ Charge­sheet (Exh.28), FIR (Exh.29), Spot panchanama (Exh.30), Inquest Panchanama (Exh.31), Election Card (Exh.32), Adhar Card of Claimant No. 1 (Exh.33), Pan Card of Claimant No. 1 (Exh.34), AA Form (Exh.35), Certification of Registration of vehicle (Exh.36), Insurance Policy (Exh.37). AS TO ISSUE NOS. 1 AND 2 : 10) Issues nos. 1 and 2 are interlinked, therefore, I decide it intermingle to avoid repetitions and for court's convenience. 6 11)It is contention of the claimants that, deceased was driving motorcycle on 23.08.2014 at about 10.30 hours on Chalisgaon to Dhule Road in moderate speed. At that time, one truck bearing No. HR­55­R­0211 came by offending side in high speed with rash and negligent manner and dashed to him. In the said accident, deceased and his friend were seriously injured. Deceased was admitted in various hospital time to time but during treatment, he expired. 12)To prove the negligence, the learned advocate for the claimants has attracted my attention to chargesheet at Exh.28, FIR at Exh.29 and spot panchanama at Exh.30. In chargesheet and F .I.R., it has been clearly mentioned that, on the date of accident, deceased was driving motorcycle in moderate speed. At that time, offending vehicle came in high speed with rash and negligent manner and dashed to him. Not only this, after thorough investigation, police has registered crime against him under section 304­A, 337, 338 of I.P .C. Not only this, spot panchanama contains sketch map. It reveals that, there is sufficient wide road on spot. As driver drove the truck in high speed with rash and negligent manner, in the result, he lost control and went on the motorcycle. Panchanama also shows that, motorcycle was totally damaged. The spot in question is towards left side of the road i.e. left side of the deceased. It means, he was driving his motorcycle 7 [MACP No.138/2015] by his side but due to non control of the truck, it went wrong side and thereby accident committed. 13)Not only this, to rebut this testimonies, respondents no. 1 and 2 being driver and owner have not appeared, though summons have been duly served. In short, the evidence adduced by the claimants have gone unchallenged and unrebutted. Therefore, the contentions raised by the claimants needs to be accepted. 14)The learned advocate of claimants has further argued that, cause of death in postmortem report shows “ Multiple and Head Injures”. This also supports to the claimants theory. Considering the circumstances, I am of the view that, deceased died in the accident on 23.08.2014 due to rash and negligent of the truck driver bearing No. HR­55­R­0211. Therefore, I answer issue nos. 1 and 2 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO. 3 : 15)The learned advocate of claimants has further argued that, deceased was just 50 years old. He was doing agriculture and milk business and was getting Rs.20,000/­ per month. Learned advocate of claimants has further argued that, though he has no document regarding the income source of Rs.20,000/­ per month, but, at least Rs.6000/­ per month may be considered. To support his contention, he relied upon following citations: 8 I)M/s Shriram General Insurance Company Ltd Vs. Renuka Sopan Dange, First Appeal No. 641/2017 dated 20.07.2017, Bombay High Court Bench at Aurangabad. II)Civil Appeal No.2828/2017 Supreme Court dated 14.02.2017. I am of the view that, the above citations are not applicable to the present case, because, it was just observation of that particular case on the basis of available documents on record. It cannot be said as a ratio. It is just obiter dictum. 16)As there is no document regarding the income source of Rs.20,000/­ per month and in absence of specific income, the income of the deceased fall under “ Notional Income Theory ”. Therefore, in view of judgment Ramchandrappa Vs Royal Sundaram Aliance Insurance Company Ltd. 2011 A.C. 273 (SC) his income is assessed of Rs.4500/­. The birth date of deceased is 01.01.1994 and accident occurred on 23.08.2014. Therefore, his age would be 50 years at the time of accident. Thus, in view of Smith Sarla Verma and ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Ors. Reported in 2009 (2) T.A.C. 677 (Supreme Court) , multiplier “13” would be applicable. There is three legal heirs of deceased. Therefore, in view of Smith Sarla Verma case (cited supra) there would be ¼ th deduction. 9 [MACP No.138/2015] 17)During treatment, the claimants have incurred medical expenses of Rs.7,57,527/­. The medical bills are at Exh. 43, 44, 50, 52, 53, 55 to 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 64, 65 to 71. The total bills is of Rs.7,62,527/­. There is discount of Rs.5000/­. Therefore, the net medical bill of Rs.7,57,527/­. The medical bills are duly proved. Not only this, the learned advocate of respondent no.3 has not much disputed the medical bills. Therefore, the total medical bill would be Rs.7,57,527/­. Considering this aspect, I proceed to calculate as follows:­ Sr. No. Heads Calculations Rupees 1) Annual income of the claimant (4,500 p.m. X 12 = 54,000/­) 54,000/­ 2) Annual income Rs.54,000/­ 1/4th deduction towards personal & living expenses Rs. 54,000 – 13,500/­ = 40,500/­40,500/­ 3) Compensation after applying multiplier of “13” : Rs. 40,500 x 13 = 5,26,500/­ 4) Medical expenses 7,57,527/­ 5) Consortium 1,00,000/­ 6) Loss of love and affection. 1,00,000/­ 7) Funeral­expenses 25,000/­ Total = 15,09,027/­ Rounded as Rs.15,09,000/­ (Rs. Fifteen Lac Nine Thousand only) for convenience. 10 18)Thus, the Claimants are entitled compensation of Rs.15,09,000/­ (Rs. Fifteen Lac Nine Thousand only). 19)The claimants have requested to grant interest @ Rs.18% per annum. I am of the view that, the said interest would be exorbitant. Instead of that, as per Kanhsingh Vs Tukaram 2015 (2) T.A.C. 689 (Supreme Court) the interest @ Rs.9% per annum would be proper and reasonable. 20)In view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Khenyei versus New India Assurance Company Limited and others. The claimant can recover the aforesaid compensation from the respondents jointly and severally. 21)Considering the above discussion, I come to conclusion that, deceased died in the motor vehicular accident dated 23/08/2014 due to rash and negligent driving of truck driver bearing No. HR­55­R­0211, which is owned by respondent no. 2 and insured with respondent no. 3. Thus, I answer issue No. 3 in the affirmative and proceed to pass the following order:­ ORDER 1)The claim­petition is allowed with proportionate costs. 11 [MACP No.138/2015] 2)Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 are directed to pay compensation of Rs.15,09,000/­ (Rs. Fifteen Lac Nine Thousand only) to the claimants jointly and severally, with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of petition, i.e. 09/02/2015 till realization of the entire payment, after deducting the NFL amount, if paid. 3)Out of awarded compensation, an amount of Rs. 6,09,000/­ (Rs. Six Lac Nine Thousand Only) be given to Claimant No. 1 and the remaining amount of Rs. 9,00,000/­ (Rs. Nine Lac Only) be invested in Fixed Deposit in the name of claimant No.1 for the welfare of claimants no. 2 and 3 (sons) for five years. 4)An award be drawn up accordingly.

Mr A.R. Kawade, Advocate for Claimants. Petition proceeded Ex­parte against respondent Nos. 1 & 2 Mr R.S. Chandre, Advocate for Respondent No.3 ....................................................................................................... J U D G M E N T (Delivered in open court on 18/08/2017) This petition is filed by the claimants for grant of compensation of Rs. 15,00,000 /­ under Section 166 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. 2) Claimant's case in nutshell is as under :­ Claimants have alleged that an accident took place on 23.08.2014, when deceased Devidas Harishchandra Dolus was going by motorcycle bearing No. MH­20­CF­5255 with his firend from Hatnoor village towards Chalisgaon. At the time of accident, deceased was driving motorcycle. He was holding driving license. When he reached near Dhule T Point on Chalisgaon to Dhule By Pass Road at about 10.30 hours, at that time, one truck bearing No. HR­55­R­0211 came from offending side in high speed with rash and negligent manner and dashed to him. The truck was 3 [MACP No.138/2015] driving by respondent no.1. In the accident, deceased and his friend sustained serious injuries. 3)They have further contended that, immediately deceased was shifted to the Bapji Hospital Chalisgaon and thereafter, shifted to Saoji Orthopedic Hospital Aurangabad. He was admitted as indoor patient from 23.08.2014 to 03.09.2014. Thereafter, he was shifted to Max Super Speciality Hospital Aurangabad from 03.09.2014 to 22.09.2014. During treatment he expired on 22.09.2014. 4)They have further contended that, during treatment, he spent of Rs.8,00,000/­ towards hospital charges, doctor fees, medicine, transportation and other allied expenses. Thereafter, Chalisgaon Police Station has registered crime against truck driver under section 304­A, 279, 337, 338, 427 of I.P .C. The police has prepared spot and inquest panchanama. Medical Officer carried out postmortem. At the time of accident, deceased was doing agriculture and milk businesses. Out of that, he was getting of Rs.20,000/­ per month. But due to untimely death of deceased, the entire family is facing starvation. Claimant no.1 is wife and claimants no. 2 and 3 are sons of the deceased. At the time of accident, deceased was only 50 years old. 5)They further contended that, respondent no.1 is driver, respondent no.2 is registered owner and respondent no.3 is 4 Insurance Company of the truck. Therefore, all respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation. They lastly prayed compensation of Rs.15,00,000/­ with interest @ 18% p.a. be awarded. 6)Respondents no. 1 and 2 have been duly served summons vide Exh. 24 and 25 respectively. Inspite of that, they failed to appear. Thus, ex­parte order passed against them. 7)Respondent no.3 has filed written­statement vide Exh.15 and denied entire allegations. He has specifically contended that, truck bearing No. HR­55­R­0211 was insured with Insurance Company but rest of the contents are not correct. The driver of the truck was not holding license. He has committed breach of condition of policy. Therefore, company is not liable to pay compensation. The driver was not driving truck in rash and negligent manner. The speed of the truck was moderated. He has not committed any fault. The age of the deceased was more than 52 years. Moreover, claimants have not incurred Rs.8,00,000/­ for the medical expenses as alleged. On the contrary, accident occurred due to negligence of the deceased, because, he was driving motorcycle in rash and negligent manner. Police has registered crime against him without proper investigation. The claim is exorbitant. In all counts, claim deserves to be rejected. 5 [MACP No.138/2015] 8)From the rival pleadings of the parties, issues are framed vide Exh. 22 and I record my findings against each of them for the reasons given below:­ SR. NO.ISSUES FINDINGS 1)Whether the claimants prove that, the deceased died in the motor vehicular accident dated 22/09/2014 ?: In the Affirmative. 2)Whether the claimants prove that, the deceased died in the accident due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing No. HR­55­R­0211 ?: In the Affirmative. 3)What is just and reasonable amount of compensation ?: In the Affirmative. As per final order. 4)What order and Award? :As per final order. REASONS 9) The claimants are relied upon the following documents:­ Charge­sheet (Exh.28), FIR (Exh.29), Spot panchanama (Exh.30), Inquest Panchanama (Exh.31), Election Card (Exh.32), Adhar Card of Claimant No. 1 (Exh.33), Pan Card of Claimant No. 1 (Exh.34), AA Form (Exh.35), Certification of Registration of vehicle (Exh.36), Insurance Policy (Exh.37). AS TO ISSUE NOS. 1 AND 2 : 10) Issues nos. 1 and 2 are interlinked, therefore, I decide it intermingle to avoid repetitions and for court's convenience. 6 11)It is contention of the claimants that, deceased was driving motorcycle on 23.08.2014 at about 10.30 hours on Chalisgaon to Dhule Road in moderate speed. At that time, one truck bearing No. HR­55­R­0211 came by offending side in high speed with rash and negligent manner and dashed to him. In the said accident, deceased and his friend were seriously injured. Deceased was admitted in various hospital time to time but during treatment, he expired. 12)To prove the negligence, the learned advocate for the claimants has attracted my attention to chargesheet at Exh.28, FIR at Exh.29 and spot panchanama at Exh.30. In chargesheet and F .I.R., it has been clearly mentioned that, on the date of accident, deceased was driving motorcycle in moderate speed. At that time, offending vehicle came in high speed with rash and negligent manner and dashed to him. Not only this, after thorough investigation, police has registered crime against him under section 304­A, 337, 338 of I.P .C. Not only this, spot panchanama contains sketch map. It reveals that, there is sufficient wide road on spot. As driver drove the truck in high speed with rash and negligent manner, in the result, he lost control and went on the motorcycle. Panchanama also shows that, motorcycle was totally damaged. The spot in question is towards left side of the road i.e. left side of the deceased. It means, he was driving his motorcycle 7 [MACP No.138/2015] by his side but due to non control of the truck, it went wrong side and thereby accident committed. 13)Not only this, to rebut this testimonies, respondents no. 1 and 2 being driver and owner have not appeared, though summons have been duly served. In short, the evidence adduced by the claimants have gone unchallenged and unrebutted. Therefore, the contentions raised by the claimants needs to be accepted. 14)The learned advocate of claimants has further argued that, cause of death in postmortem report shows “ Multiple and Head Injures”. This also supports to the claimants theory. Considering the circumstances, I am of the view that, deceased died in the accident on 23.08.2014 due to rash and negligent of the truck driver bearing No. HR­55­R­0211. Therefore, I answer issue nos. 1 and 2 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO. 3 : 15)The learned advocate of claimants has further argued that, deceased was just 50 years old. He was doing agriculture and milk business and was getting Rs.20,000/­ per month. Learned advocate of claimants has further argued that, though he has no document regarding the income source of Rs.20,000/­ per month, but, at least Rs.6000/­ per month may be considered. To support his contention, he relied upon following citations: 8 I)M/s Shriram General Insurance Company Ltd Vs. Renuka Sopan Dange, First Appeal No. 641/2017 dated 20.07.2017, Bombay High Court Bench at Aurangabad. II)Civil Appeal No.2828/2017 Supreme Court dated 14.02.2017. I am of the view that, the above citations are not applicable to the present case, because, it was just observation of that particular case on the basis of available documents on record. It cannot be said as a ratio. It is just obiter dictum. 16)As there is no document regarding the income source of Rs.20,000/­ per month and in absence of specific income, the income of the deceased fall under “ Notional Income Theory ”. Therefore, in view of judgment Ramchandrappa Vs Royal Sundaram Aliance Insurance Company Ltd. 2011 A.C. 273 (SC) his income is assessed of Rs.4500/­. The birth date of deceased is 01.01.1994 and accident occurred on 23.08.2014. Therefore, his age would be 50 years at the time of accident. Thus, in view of Smith Sarla Verma and ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Ors. Reported in 2009 (2) T.A.C. 677 (Supreme Court) , multiplier “13” would be applicable. There is three legal heirs of deceased. Therefore, in view of Smith Sarla Verma case (cited supra) there would be ¼ th deduction. 9 [MACP No.138/2015] 17)During treatment, the claimants have incurred medical expenses of Rs.7,57,527/­. The medical bills are at Exh. 43, 44, 50, 52, 53, 55 to 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 64, 65 to 71. The total bills is of Rs.7,62,527/­. There is discount of Rs.5000/­. Therefore, the net medical bill of Rs.7,57,527/­. The medical bills are duly proved. Not only this, the learned advocate of respondent no.3 has not much disputed the medical bills. Therefore, the total medical bill would be Rs.7,57,527/­. Considering this aspect, I proceed to calculate as follows:­ Sr. No. Heads Calculations Rupees 1) Annual income of the claimant (4,500 p.m. X 12 = 54,000/­) 54,000/­ 2) Annual income Rs.54,000/­ 1/4th deduction towards personal & living expenses Rs. 54,000 – 13,500/­ = 40,500/­40,500/­ 3) Compensation after applying multiplier of “13” : Rs. 40,500 x 13 = 5,26,500/­ 4) Medical expenses 7,57,527/­ 5) Consortium 1,00,000/­ 6) Loss of love and affection. 1,00,000/­ 7) Funeral­expenses 25,000/­ Total = 15,09,027/­ Rounded as Rs.15,09,000/­ (Rs. Fifteen Lac Nine Thousand only) for convenience. 10 18)Thus, the Claimants are entitled compensation of Rs.15,09,000/­ (Rs. Fifteen Lac Nine Thousand only). 19)The claimants have requested to grant interest @ Rs.18% per annum. I am of the view that, the said interest would be exorbitant. Instead of that, as per Kanhsingh Vs Tukaram 2015 (2) T.A.C. 689 (Supreme Court) the interest @ Rs.9% per annum would be proper and reasonable. 20)In view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Khenyei versus New India Assurance Company Limited and others. The claimant can recover the aforesaid compensation from the respondents jointly and severally. 21)Considering the above discussion, I come to conclusion that, deceased died in the motor vehicular accident dated 23/08/2014 due to rash and negligent driving of truck driver bearing No. HR­55­R­0211, which is owned by respondent no. 2 and insured with respondent no. 3. Thus, I answer issue No. 3 in the affirmative and proceed to pass the following order:­ ORDER 1)The claim­petition is allowed with proportionate costs. 11 [MACP No.138/2015] 2)Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 are directed to pay compensation of Rs.15,09,000/­ (Rs. Fifteen Lac Nine Thousand only) to the claimants jointly and severally, with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of petition, i.e. 09/02/2015 till realization of the entire payment, after deducting the NFL amount, if paid. 3)Out of awarded compensation, an amount of Rs. 6,09,000/­ (Rs. Six Lac Nine Thousand Only) be given to Claimant No. 1 and the remaining amount of Rs. 9,00,000/­ (Rs. Nine Lac Only) be invested in Fixed Deposit in the name of claimant No.1 for the welfare of claimants no. 2 and 3 (sons) for five years. 4)An award be drawn up accordingly.

P.S.Tandulje Advocate for applicant. Proceeded Exparte against respondents No. 1 and 2 Shri. Dahiwal Advocate for respondent No.3 2 MACP 40/2015 (J) J U D G M E N T (Delivered on this 3rd day of March 2020) 1.This is an application u/s 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (hereinafter referred to as the 'Act') for award of compensation for the injured applicant Lilabai w/o Ramesh Londhe, (hereinafter referred to as 'the injured') in a motor vehicle accident. 2.The material averments in the application may be stated that o n 24/04/2012 at about 09.30 p.m. injured along with her husband were waiting for arrival of the bus near Bhadramaroti Bhakta Niwas on Khultabad­ Phulambri road for going to her village Bodakha. That time, Swift Maruti Car bearing No.MH­20­BV­9111 came from opposite side in the high speed and gave dash to the injured. As a result of which, injured sustained with multiple injuries. She was also sustained with the head injury in the accident. Accident was taken place due to the rash and negligent driving on the part of car driver. Respondent No. 1 is the driver and respondent No.2 is the owner of that vehicle. That vehicle was insured with the respondent No.3, hence all the respondents are liable to pay the compensation to the injured. 3.It is further contention of the claimant that, initially she was admitted in the Rural Hospital, Khultabad and thereafter she was shifted to GHATI Hospital, Aurangabad, but her condition was more critical hence she was shifted in hospital of Dr. Milind Dunakhe at Aurangabad for the period 23/4/2012 to 2/5/2012. She was operated and treated for the head injury. She has undergone several medical tests. Thereafter, again on 22/10/2014 she was admitted in the Hospital of Dr. Milind Dunakhe and she was inpatient for 18 days i.e. up to 10/11/2014. She has spent Rs/­5,00,000/­ for the said medical treatment and she is also required to take further medical treatment and its approximate expense is Rs/­3,00,000/­. At the time of accident she 3 MACP 40/2015 (J) was 38 years old. She was gaining income Rs/­9,000/­ per month. She has become disabled in the accident and unable to do the work which she was doing earlier. Thus, she claims compensation Rs/­8,00,000/­ for the futhre loss of income and loss of amenities. 4.Respondent No.1, though served with the notice but did not appear hence petition proceeded exparte against him. Respondent No.2, though appeared but failed to file Written Statement hence petition proceeded without Written Statement against him. 5.Respondent No.3 has resisted the claim by filing Written Statement below Exh.14. The medical bills and disability is denied. The age as well as income of the injured is denied. It has been also denied that, accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving on the part of the Car driver. 6.My learned predecessor framed f ollowing issues for the determination. I have recorded my finding and reasons thereon as under. Issues Findings 1. Does the claimant prove that accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1 Yes. 2. Does the claimant further prove that she sustained permanent disability in the alleged accident? Yes. 3. Is petitioner entitled to get compensation Rs. 5,00,612/­ If yes from whom? from respondents REASONS As to issue No.1:­ 7.The claim of the injured about involvement and rash and 4 MACP 40/2015 (J) negligent driving of Swift Maruti Car bearing No.MH­20­BV­9111 find supports from the documents produced on the record. Accident took place on 22/04/2012 and claimant was seriously injured in the accident. As she was under the medical treatment, police recorded her statement on 6/5/2012. Certified copies of FIR (Exh.23), Spot Panchanama (Exh.24) are produced on the record. On perusal of description shown in the Spot panchanama it clearly reveals that, accident was happened due to the rash and negligent driving on the part of car driver. After considering the situation on the spot, police had filed charge sheet against the driver of car for offences punishable under Section 279, 337 and 338 of the Indian Penal Code. 8.Even injured Lilabai Londhe (A.W.1) deposes about the details of manner and occurrence of the accident. She has faced the incident from very close distance. No doubt, it was suggested to her that she was crossing the road without looking the situation of vehicle hence the accident took place, but she specifically denied it. Thus, that itself may not be treated as rash and negligent act on the part of claimant. The other situation shown in the spot panchanama clearly goes to show that the car driver was unable to control his vehicle, hence he gave dash to the injured. The further cross­ examination also suggestive of the fact that erring car was involved in the accident. The driver of the vehicle did not enter into the witness box to say anything in the rebuttal. Hence, I have no hesitation to hold that, Swift Maruti Car bearing No.MH­20­BV­9111 was involved in the accident and accident was caused due to rash and negligent driving on the part of its driver. As to point No. 2 : 9.Injured claimant has deposed that immediately after the accident he was admitted in the Rural Hospital, Khultabad and thereafter she 5 MACP 40/2015 (J) was shifted to M.G.M. Hospital, Aurangabad for further treatment. However, her condition was critical hence she was admitted in the Dunakhe Hospital, at Aurangabad initially for about nine days i.e. from 23/04/2012 to 2//5/2012. Thereafter, she was again admitted in the said hospital for 18 days i.e. since 22/10/2014 to 10/11/2014 for further treatment. She has also produced injury certificate issued by the doctor of above hospital. As well as, she has also produced medical bills of the said hospital. In order to prove all these documents she has examined Dr. Milind Dunakhe (P.W.2) who has deposed about the genuineness and correctness of the amount of the bill and the documents of treatment. Medical bill Exh. 36 dated 2/5/2012 for Rs.1,04,000/­ is duly proved in the evidence of this witness. The further medical bills Exh. 37 for Rs/­1200, Exh.38 for Rs/­ 3200/­, Exh.39 for Rs/­ 2200/­, Exh.40 for Rs/­20,000/­ for Rs/­20,000/­ Exh.41 for Rs/­ 3200/­, Exh.43 for Rs/­22,100/­, Exh. 46 for Rs/­800/­ are duly proved in the evidence of Dr. Milind Dunakhe. Thus, as per above medical papers the total medical expenses of the above hospital come near about Rs/­1,56,700/­. Further, claimant has produced the bills of medicine purchased from Siddhi Medical and General Stores. She has examined to Natesh Karantkar (P.W.3) to prove all those medical bills. The total amount of these medicine bills come to Rs/­1,08,912/­. Except the general suggestions in his cross­ examination, nothing tangible is brought on the record to discard his evidence in respect of bills which are with serial numbers and most of the bill are computer generated bills showing dates and time. Thus, the total medical expenses may not be less than Rs.2,65,612/­. 10.Dr. Milind Dunakhe (P.W.2) is Neuro Surgeon. According to him, as per CT­Scan report there was hemorrhagic contusion right frontal lobe with minimal shifts of midline to left cerebral edema. Patient was operated on right front temporal, decompressive cramiectomy with evaculation of acture subdural hametoma. Thus, he has determined 25% 6 MACP 40/2015 (J) permanent disability and issued PDC Exh.42. However, it has not been clarified that whether the said percentage of disability is in respect of the whole body or in respect of the particular limb. As well as, the opinion of the Orthopedic Surgeon is not taken and the disability is not determined by the Medical Board. However, considering the nature of injuries sustained to the injured, especially the head injury, the permanent disability in respect of whole body may not be less than 15%. Thus, the permanent disability is determined 15% of the whole body. 11.According to the claimant she was earning Rs/­9,000/­ per month but there is no evidence about it. She is doing household and agricultural labour work, hence her notional income Rs/­5,000/­ per months needs to be taken into consideration. 12.P.W.4 Nirmala Salukhe is Headmistress of Zilla Parishad Primary School, Salukheda, Tal. Khultabad. She has produced copy of school register (Exh.54) in which the date of birth of the claimant is shown 05/07/1973. Hence, the age of claimant on the date of accident comes to 38 years. Her annual income at the time of the accident comes to Rs/­60,000/­. Considering the age the multiplier of 15 is made applicable hence the amount comes Rs/­9,00,000/­. If the 15% permanent disability is held the amount of compensation towards the loss of earning capacity comes to Rs/­ 1,35,000/­. 13.Claimant also deposes that her family members were also compelled to stay in the hospital. Thus, considering all above aspects, and the period of his hospitalization, she is entitled to receive compensation under different heads as under. Loss of income during treatment 30,000/­ Medical Expenses 2,65,612/­ 7 MACP 40/2015 (J) Pain and suffering 50,000/­ Healthy diet 20,000/­ Loss of earning capacity and amenities 1,35,000/­ Total 5,00,612/­ 14.In short, claimant is entitled to receive total compensation Rs/­ 5,00,612/­. It is also established that, respondent No.2 is the registered owner of the erring vehicle and the vehicle is insured with the respondent No.3 Insurance Company. Thus, the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the claimant with proportionate costs. Resultantly, following order is passed. ORDER 1. The application is partly allowed with proportionate costs. 2. The respondents to pay the sum of Rs. 5,00,612/­ (Rs. Five Lacs Six Hundred Twelve only) to the applicant inclusive of the compensation awarded u/s 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act, with interest at the rate of 8% per annum from the date of the application till realization of the amount. 3.Award be drawn accordingly on payment of deficit court fee stamp if any.

R E A S O N S ISSUE NOS.1 AND 2 : 6.Petitioner Tarabai widow of the deceased Motorcycle rider has examined herself on behalf of all petitioners. They also examined Mr.Vijay Devmane (PW2) driver of the Ambulance by which the deceased was shifted to Ghati Hospital, Aurangabad from the spot of accident. 7.In support of oral evidence the documentary evidence (Exh.33 to 44) which include the copy of FIR, the spot panchnama, inquest panchnama and postmortem notes of the deceased, copy of smart card of .. 6 .. MACP No.372/2015 (Judgment) registration, photo copy of insurance policy and report in Form COMP­'AA' of the Car involved in the accident. 8.The petitioners have also produced the purchase receipts (Exh.40 and 41) of two Cows, the certificate of Grampanchayat (Exh.42), 7/12 extract of land gut no.283, driving licence (Exh.43) of respondent no.1 and police statement of Smt.Tarabai (PW1). None of the respondents have tendered any evidence. 9.It is undisputed fact that Smt.Tarabai (PW1) had not witness the accident in question of her deceased husband. She has deposed on the basis of the papers of investigation of said accident collected from concerned police station with whom the crime was registered against respondent no.1­ driver of Car in question. Mr.Vijay Devmali (PW2) is driver of Ambulance by which the deceased was removed in injured condition to Ghati Hospital. 10.The copy (Exh.33) of FIR of Crime bearing CR No. 67/2015 registered with Phulambri Police Station shows that Mr.Ganpat Maruti More, who is brother of the deceased, gave the information of the accident to the said Police Station on 28.4.2015. The accident in question took place on 23.4.2015. From the information he had collected from the person who had removed his brother to Ghati Hospital he came to know that Swift Desire Car No.MH­19 BU­2647 came in high speed from Phulambri road by overtaking .. 7 .. MACP No.372/2015 (Judgment) another vehicle dashed to motorcycle of the deceased. The true copies of the papers of investigation produced by petitioners go to show that the said Car was standing on the spot when the panchnama dated 23.4.2015 prepared by investigating officer. 11.Having considered the impact of the collision of the motorcycle and the Car in question on their bodies, as reflects from the true copy (Exh.34) of the spot panchnama, it is very clear that it is not a case of “hit and run”. The left front side head light, bonnet, wind glass, radiator, battery, coolant tank of said Car seen in bent/damaged condition. On considering the oral evidence of Smt.Tarabai (PW1), in the light of above established fact which has been gone unchallenged, it is transpired that the accident of both vehicles was resulted due to rash and negligent, that is to say high speed and overtaking of the Car by respondent no.1. 12.The true copy (Exh.35) of inquest panchnama and true copy (Exh.36) of postmortem notes of the deceased clearly indicate that he was expired on the spot due to head injury received in the accident in question. All these established facts make me to hold that issue nos.1 and 2 are proved. Hence, I answer them in affirmative. ISSUE NOS.3 TO 5 : 13.None of the respondents have denied their relation with the Car .. 8 .. MACP No.372/2015 (Judgment) in question at the time of the accident. Therefore, there is no need to discuss more than this about issue no.3. In short, said issue is proved and I answer it in affirmative. 14.The petitioners have not produced any document in support of the age of the deceased. In postmortem report and inquest panchnama his approximately age is shown as 30 years. Relying on the approximate age mentioned in these documents, it is proper to hold that he was 30 years old at the time of his accident in question. 15.According to the petitioners the deceased was a Meson and earning for his livelihood. In addition to that he was doing dairy business having buffaloes, so also, the income from agriculture. His widow has stated said facts in her examination­in­chief. In cross­examination she has denied all suggestions given on behalf of insurance company on the point of sources and quantum of his monthly/yearly income. 16.It is significant to note that the petitioners have produced two certificates (Exh.40 and 41) respectively dated 13.6.2014 and 28.4.2014 regarding purchase of Jersey cows, issued by Grampanchayat, Pimpalgaon Peth, Tq. Sillod. It is argued on behalf of the petitioners that vide said receipts the deceased had purchased said cows for his dairy business. On perusal of these receipts, I find substance in said submission. It leads me to hold that the .. 9 .. MACP No.372/2015 (Judgment) deceased was doing dairy business and must be having at least Rs.3,000/­ monthly income from said source. The petitioners have produced the 7/12 extract of land gut no.283, situated at village Pimpalgaon Peth. In this document the land to the extent of 40 Are is shown in the name of deceased as an owner and he was in his possession. The said land is jirayat land, means he was taking seasonal crops in it. Therefore, it can be safely said that he must be having yearly income at least Rs.12,000/­ or in an average Rs.1,000/­ per month from said land. 17.Considering the age and the quantum of monthly income from three sources as has been held in above para, I hold that the deceased must be having monthly income of Rs.6,000/­ by working as a Meson @ Rs.200/­ per day, Rs.3,000/­ from his dairy business and Rs.1,000/­ from agriculture. Therefore, his monthly income, in my opinion, was Rs.10,000/­ per month on the day of accident. I hold that only respondent no.2­ owner and respondent no.3­ insurance company of the Car in question are jointly and severally liable to pay the just compensation to the petitioners, as computed below on its basis and answer issue nos.4 and 5 accordingly. Computation of the compensation 1. Monthly Notional income of the deceased Rs.10,000/­ 2.Minus 1/4 towards personal expenses.

The claimant further contended that he was admitted at AIMS Hospital, Aurangabad on 25.08.2013 and has taken treatment in the said hospital till 02.06.2013. 3.The claimant further contended that on the basis of report lodged by Pratap Dhondiram Mirge, Bhokardan Police Station registered crime bearing No.I­57/2013 under Section 279, 338, 427 of I.P.C. against the driver of offending motorcycle bearing registration No.MH­20­BP­2286 i.e. respondent No.1. 4.The claimant further contended that at the time of accident, he was 39 years of age, was having good personality and doing agricultural work and also working as L.I.C. Agent and earning Rs.2,00,000/­ per year from agriculture and Rs.3,41,447/­ from the agency. He further contended that because of said 3 M.A.C.P.No.729/2015, [ Judgment ]. accident he is not able to do agricultural work as well as run his agency as agent of L.I.C. He further contended that respondent No.1 was driving the said offending vehicle, at the time of accident and the same was owned by respondent No.2. As such, respondent No.1 & 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to him. Thus, the claimant has claimed total compensation of Rs.5,00,000/­ including the compensation under other conventional heads. 5.Respondent No.1 & 2 filed their written statement at Exh­18. They denied all adverse contentions of the claimant. They contended that they are not at all concern with the said accident. Their vehicle is falsely involved in the accident only for the purpose of claiming compensation. They further denied the age, income of the claimant and submitted that the petition be rejected. 6.From the rival pleadings of the parties, I have framed following issues below Exh­23 and I answer them for the reasons stated below. I S S U E S F I N D I N G S 1.Whether the claimant prove that he sustained injuries in motor vehicular accident held on 28.05.2013, at about 3.00 p.m., on Sillod Bhokardan road, at Ibrahimpur Phata ? ..

Rs.2,31,280/­ with interest @8% P.A. from Respondent No.1&2 jointly and severally. 4.What order and award ? .. As per final order. R E A S O N S 7.In order to substantiate the contentions raised in the petition, claimant examined himself as CW1 at Exh­25. Dr. Virendra Kamalnarayan Jaiswal as CW2 at Exh 40, Dr. Parmeshwar Shivlal Jaiswal as CW3 at Exh­43 and has produced certified copies of relevant police papers pertaining to the accident. They are F.I.R. at Exh­30, Spot Panchanama at Exh­31, Charge­sheet at Exh­32, Statement of claimant at Exh­33, Discharge Card at Exh­41, Disability Certificate at Exh­44 and filed evidence close Pursis at Exh­45. 8.Respondents have examined respondent No.1 as RW1 at Exh­47 and filed their evidence close Pursis at Exh­48. 9.Learned advocate appearing for the claimant submitted that the police papers pertaining to the accident in question clearly indicates that respondent No.1 was driving motorcycle bearing registration No.MH­20­BP­2286 in rash and negligent manner and gave dash to the motorcycle on which the 5 M.A.C.P.No.729/2015, [ Judgment ]. claimant was travelling because of which the claimant has sustained grievous injury. He further submitted that CW2 Dr. Virendra Kamalnarayan Jaiswal of AIMS Hospital examined by the claimant has stated in his deposition that the patient Raosaheb Dhondiram Mirge was admitted in their hospital on 28.05.2013 and he was unconscious, at the time of admission and has taken treatment upto 02.06.2013. He further contended that brother of the claimant who has lodged report has stated in the report that there was no one to look­after the claimant. Therefore, there is delay in lodging the report. The delay in lodging the report is explained by informant. Therefore, it cannot be said that the vehicle of respondents is falsely involved in the accident. He further submitted that at the time of accident the offending vehicle was driven by respondent No.1 and owned by respondent No.2. Therefore, respondent No.1 & 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the claimant. 10.The Learned advocate appearing for the respondents submitted that the accident has occurred on 28.05.2013. The report is lodged on 15.06.2013. The delay in lodging report is not properly explained by the claimant. He further submitted that it appears from the record that the statement of claimant is recorded on 14.05.2013 which is prior to the accident which clearly shows that the vehicle is falsely involved only for the purpose of claiming compensation from the respondents and submitted that the petition be rejected. 6 M.A.C.P.No.729/2015, [ Judgment ]. As to Issue No.1 & 2 : 11.Having considered the oral submissions made on behalf of claimant and respondents, I have gone through the oral as well as documentary evidence placed on record by the claimant. It is seen from the testimony of CW1 and copy of F.I.R. at Exh­30, Spot Panchanama at Exh­31 and charge­sheet at Exh­32 that respondent No.1 was driving the offending motorcycle in rash and negligent manner. CW1 has deposed in his cross that his statement was recorded on 07.06.2013. It appears from the record that the date 14.05.2013 is wrongly recorded in the statement of claimant has on all the other papers the date is mentioned as 14.06.2013. CW2 examined by the claimant has deposed that the claimant was unconscious when he was admitted in the hospital and has taken treatment in the hospital till 02.06.2013. The informant the brother of claimant has also explained the delay while lodging report in the report. He has stated in the report that there was no one to look­after the claimant when he was hospitalized. Hence, there is delay in lodging the report. 12.RW1 has admitted in his cross examination that he has sustained injuries in the accident for the which the claim petition is filed. From the admission of RW1, it cannot be said that the vehicle is falsely involved in the accident. RW1 has further admitted that he has not challenged the F.I.R. as well as the charge­sheet filed against him. The testimony of CW1, the admission of 7 M.A.C.P.No.729/2015, [ Judgment ]. RW1 clearly shows that the accident has occurred on 28.05.2013 and the claimant has sustained injuries in the said accident. The police papers filed on record also shows that respondent No.1 was driving the offending motorcycle in rash and negligent manner. Hence, I answer Issue No.1 & 2 as 'Yes'. As to Issue No.3 : 13.The claimant has deposed in his affidavit of evidence at Exh­25 that he was possessing good and sound health and was living free life without any disability and was doing agriculture work as well as he was having agency of LIC and earning Rs.5,41,000/­ per year from agriculture and LIC agency. The claimant has not produced any documentary evidence or any other evidence to show that he was earning Rs.5,41,000/­ per year. Therefore, Rs.4,500/­ is taken as notional income of claimant. The annual income of claimant comes to Rs.54,000/­. 14.The claimant has not deposed his age at the time of accident in the affidavit of evidence filed by him. The age of claimant is mentioned as 38 years in police papers. Therefore, the same is taken into consideration as the age of claimant, at the time of accident and the multiplier of 15 is applied as per the guidelines issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sarla Verma vs Delhi Transport Corporation and another reported in AIR 2009 SC 3104 . By 8 M.A.C.P.No.729/2015, [ Judgment ]. applying multiplier 15, the loss of earning of claimant comes to Rs.8,10,000/­. 15.The claimant has examined Dr. Parmeshwar Shivlal Jaiswal orthopedic surgeon. The said surgeon has deposed that the claimant has sustained head injury with fracture, third metatarsus right side with loss of five teeth upper jaw. Now the claimant has intense headache and pain in cervical spine. He has giddiness. He cannot concentrate on regular job. He has less memory than before. His teeth were replaced. He has difficulty in chewing and has permanent disability 30% by Mc Bride scale and has produced disability certificate at Exh­44. As per said disability certificate, the claimant is suffering 30% disability. Therefore, 30% of Rs.8,10,000/­ comes to Rs.2,43,000/­ which is loss of earning of the claimant. 16.The claimant has also examined Dr. Virendra Kamalnarayan Jaiswal of AIMS Hospital where the claimant has taken treatment. The said doctor has produced final bill issued by their hospital for the treatment of claimant. As per final bill, the claimant has incurred expenditure of Rs.21,100/­ towards his medical treatment. The claimant is entitle for the said expenses incurred by him on medical treatment. It has also come in evidence that claimant has suffered injury because of motor accident. Therefore, in my opinion, it would be just and proper to grant compensation to the claimant for the pains, damages and mental trauma suffered by him. Hence, I grant Rs.25,000/­ for the damage, pains and 9 M.A.C.P.No.729/2015, [ Judgment ]. mental trauma suffered by claimant because of the accident. Therefore, the claimant is entitle to total compensation of Rs.2,89,100/­. 17.It appears from the evidence that there is head and collision between both the motorcycles i.e. motorcycle of claimant and respondent No.1. Therefore, respondent No.1 alone cannot be held responsible for the accident. Therefore, in my opinion, it will be proper that 20% of the compensation amount is deducted as contributory negligence of claimant in the accident. After deducting 20% from the total compensation, the claimant is entitle to compensation to Rs.2,31,280/­. 18.It appears from the record that the claimant has received an amount of Rs.25,000/­ towards interim compensation. Therefore, it will be appropriate to deduct the said amount from total compensation. After deducting Rs.25,000/­ from the amount of Rs.2,31,280/­, it comes to Rs.2,06,280/­. 19.Taking into consideration, the period of pendency of claim petition and the amount of compensation, it will be appropriate to grant interest @8% per annum from the date of filing petition till the realization of entire compensation. Accordingly, I answer Issue No.3 and proceed to pass following order. O R D E R 1.The petition is partly allowed. 2.the claimant is entitle to total compensation of Rs.2,31,280/­ inclusive of No Fault Liability. 10 M.A.C.P.No.729/2015, [ Judgment ]. 3.The respondent No.1 & 2 do pay an amount of Rs.2,06,280/­ as compensation exclusive of No Fault Liability to the claimant jointly and severally along with interest 8% per annum from the date of filing of petition, till realization of entire amount. 4.The amount of compensation be paid to the claimant by account payee cheque on proper identification. 5.The respondent No.1 & 2 do pay proportionate cost of the petition to the claimant and bear their own cost. 6.Award be drawn accordingly.

The claimant was doing labour work before the accident 4 M.A.C.P. No..278/2015 [Judgment] and getting Rs.6,000/­ per month. The claimant was maintaining herself and her family members out of her income. However, due to accidental injuries and permanent disablement, the claimant can not do any work. Therefore, the claimant and her family have lost income of claimant. 6.At the time of accident, the offending truck bearing registration No.AP­16­TT­5277 was owned by respondent No.2, driven by respondent No..3 and insured with respondent No..1. The accident occurred due to sole negligence of respondent No.3. Therefore, the claimant claimed compensation from respondent Nos. 1 to 3 jointly and severally. 7.Respondent No.1­Insurance company filed its written statement at Exh. 18 and denied the contents of the application. It is denied that, the accident occurred due to rash and negligent act of respondent No.3. It is submitted by this respondent that, the accident took place at square in the middle of road. The truck was proceeding in right direction. The accident occurred due to negligence of driver of 5 M.A.C.P. No..278/2015 [Judgment] motorcycle bearing registration No. MH­21­G­9430. It is further contended that, the driver of offending truck i.e. respondent No.3 was not holding effective and valid driving license at the time of accident. Therefore, there is breach of terms and conditions of insurance policy. Age and income of the claimant at the time of accident is denied by this respondent. Alternatively, it is prayed that, the driver of motorcycle bearing registration No. MH­21­G­9430 is to be held responsible for the accident on the principle of contributory negligence. Lastly, this respondent prayed to dismiss the application with costs. 8.The respondent Nos.2 and 3 filed their written statement and say at Exh. 12 thereby they denied the contents of application. It is denied that, the accident occurred due to negligence of respondent No.3. It is also denied that, in the accident, the claimant sustained fracture injuries and concerned doctors operated the claimant and inserted rod in the left hand and left leg of the claimant. Age and income of the claimant is also denied. However, it is admitted by these 6 M.A.C.P. No..278/2015 [Judgment] respondents that, the truck bearing registration No.AP­16­TT­ 5277 was owned by respondent No.2, driven by respondent No.3 and validly insured with respondent No.1 at the time of accident. Alternatively, it is contended that, if the claimant found entitled to receive compensation, in that event, same may kindly be ordered to recover from respondent No..1­ Insurance company. Lastly, it is prayed to dismiss the claim petition against these respondents. 9.Issues are framed at Exh. 19. I record my findings thereon for the reasons to follow :­ ISSUES FINDINGS 1.Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing No.AP­16­TT­5277 by respondent No.3 ?:In the affirmative 2.Whether the claimant sustained permanent disability due to the injuries suffered by her in the said accident ?: In the affirmative 3.Whether the claimant is entitled to get compensation ?

No..278/2015 [Judgment] REASONS AS TO ISSUE No.1 :­ 10.The claimant, in support of her claim has filed her affidavit of examination­in­chief at Exh. 12. Her affidavit is replica of her petition. The claimant has also filed on record certified copy of F.I.R. (Exh.40), Spot panchnama (Exh.41), Motor driving license of respondent No.3 (Exh.42), Insurance cover note of offending vehicle (Exh.43), Certificate of information of offending vehicle issued by Government of Andhra Pradesh Transport Department (Exh.44), Certificate of fitness of offending truck vehicle (Exh.45), Discharge summary of the claimant issued by Government Medical College, Aurangabad (Exh.46), Form Comp.AA (Exh.49), Aadhar Card of claimant (Exhj.47), Disability certificate of the claimant (Exh.26), Discharge card issued by Global Hospital, Aurangabad (Exh.34), Hospitalization bill of Global Hospital of the claimant (Exh.33), Medical bills of the claimant at page Nos. 2 to 16 (collectively Exh.48) Driving License (Exh.34), Goods Carriage Permit (Exh.35), Certificate of Fitness 8 M.A.C.P. No..278/2015 [Judgment] (Exh.36),Pollution Under Control Certificate issued by Gujarat Motor Vehicle Department (Exh.38), Receipt under B.M.V. Tax Act (Exh.39), Certificate of Registration (Exh.40), Certificate of Taxation (Exh.41) and Certificate of Registration (Exh.42), Motor Driving License Particulars (Exh.42). 11.The police papers filed by the claimant are not denied by the respondents. The police papers and evidence of the claimant show that, the truck bearing registration No. AP­ 16­TT­5277 being driven by the respondent No.3 was involved in the accident. The claimant deposed in her affidavit evidence about the occurrence of accident as per her claim petition. During cross­examination by respondent No..1, nothing could be elicited on the point of accident. Moreover, respondent No.3­driver of the offending truck vehicle did not entered into the witness box to depose the manner in which the accident took place. Therefore, an adverse inference can be drawn against him. In view of the above facts, it is held that, the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of truck 9 M.A.C.P. No..278/2015 [Judgment] bearing registration No. AP­16­TT­5277 by respondent No.3. Hence, I answer issue No. 1 accordingly in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE No. 2 :­ 12.The claimant has examined Dr. P.S. Jaiswal at Exh. 25 on the point of permanent disability sustained by the claimant in the accident. He testified that, he conducted clinical examination and also saw old case papers of the claimant. On examination, he found that, the claimant sustained compound fracture of left tibia and compound fracture of lower end of the humerus left side and upper end of radius and ulna. She was operated for external fixation and afterwards platting at tibia. Now she can not walk on herself. She has deformity at left ankle. No movement is possible at ankle. Left foot is fixed in equinus position. There is shortening of left leg by 3 cm. There is scar at left elbow and forearm measuring 19 cm. She has false joint at left elbow. She has shortening of left arm by 4 cm. She can not use left arm. Grip of left hand is weaken than right. The disability certificate is at 10 M.A.C.P. No..278/2015 [Judgment] Exh.26. This witness has assessed permanent disability to the claimant 50% by applying Mac­Bride Scale. 13. In cross­examination by respondent No.1, this witness admitted that, the claimant has not taken treatment from him. Initial treatment of the claimant was done at Government Hospital at Auranagabad. Subsequently, the claimant took treatment at Global Hospital. He further stated that, during examination of claimant, he found totally four fractures to the claimant. He issued disability certificate relying on the discharge card issued by Global hospital and Government Medical College and Hospital, Aurangabad. He further stated that, 50% disability of the claimant is segregated as 25% for upper limb and 25% for lower limb. 14.Learned Advocate for respondent No.1 argued that, this witness has assessed excessive disability of the claimant. He further argued that, the claimant might have sustained at the most 25% permanent disability. 15.This witness is an Orthopedic Surgeon. After examining the claimant clinically as well as going through the 11 M.A.C.P. No..278/2015 [Judgment] case­papers of the claimant, he issued the disability certificate. He denied the suggestion that, disability shown by him is limbwise. 16.During examination of the claimant before the Court, I observed that, the claimant was brought to the witness box by lifting her in arms by her son. Even during evidence, she could not stand on her legs. Therefore, permission was granted to her to give testimony by sitting in chair. Therefore, I do not find any reason to disbelieve the testimony of Dr. P.S. Jaiswal regarding the permanent disability sustained by the claimant to the extent of 50% in the accident. Therefore, I hold that, the claimant has sustained 50% permanent disability in the accident. Hence, I answer issue No.2 accordingly in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE No. 3 :­ 17. The claimant in her evidence (Exh.20) deposed that, before the accident she was doing labour work. She was earning Rs.6,000/­ per month. However, no any documentary evidence about income of the claimant is filed on record. 12 M.A.C.P. No..278/2015 [Judgment] 18.In this regard, considering the relevant time of accident as well as rate of wages prevalent at that time, it is just and proper to hold notional income of the claimant as Rs.4,000/­ per month. Therefore, annual income of the claimant comes to Rs.48,000/­ (Rs.4,000 x 12). 19.The claimant contends in her application as well as deposed before the Tribunal that, at the time of accident, she was 45 years old. However, the claimant has not filed on record any document showing her date of birth. The discharge card issued by Government Medical College (Exh.46) shows age of claimant as 50 years 1 month and 3 days. The discharge card issued by Global Hospital (Exh.34) shows age of claimant as 65 years. Aadhar card of claimant at Exh. 47 shows year of birth of the claimant as 1973 (i.e. almost 42 years). Age of claimant mentioned on the discharge card issued by the Government Medical College, Aurangabad seems to be accurate since it is mentioned in the form of year, month and days. Therefore, I hold that, the claimant has completed her 50 years of age at the time of accident. 13 M.A.C.P. No..278/2015 [Judgment] Therefore, in view of the ratio laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sarla Verma & ors. vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & Anr., 2009 ACJ 1298, the multiplier of 11 will have to be taken. Therefore, the future loss of earning of the claimant would be Rs.5,28,000/­(Rs.48,000 x 11). 20.While answering Issue No.2 I hold that, the claimant has sustained 50% permanent disability due to the accidental injuries. Therefore, she is entitled to the compensation of Rs.2,64,000/­ (50% of Rs.5,28,000). In addition to this, due to permanent disability, the claimant is entitled to the amount of Rs.25,000/­ for pain and sufferings and Rs.15,000/­ for attendant charges, Rs.20,000/­ for transportation charges, special diet etc. 21.The claimant has examined Dr. Mohsin Kazi of Global Hospital, Aurangabad at Exh.32. He deposed that, the claimant paid him amount of Rs.1,50,000/­ for the entire treatment given to her. Therefore, the claimant has proved hospitalization bill of Global Hospital (Exh.33). Hence, the claimant is entitled to the amount of this bill. 14 M.A.C.P. No..278/2015 [Judgment] 22.The claimant has also filed on record medicine bills of Global Medical and General Stores as well as Sudarshan Medical and General Stores, Patel Medical Stores, receipts of Nabh Accredited Blood Bank, receipts of Arpan Voluntary Blood Bank and receipts of Swaroop Surgical at page Nos. 2 to 16 (Exh. 48). On perusal of bills of Global Medical and General Stores, it reveals that, there appears overwriting regarding date of those bills. All medicine bills at page Nos. 2 to 6 appears to be of one and same date (i.e. 15.07.2015). On some bills there is overwriting about day and month. In view of this, considering the stay of the claimant at Global hospital, I think it just and proper to hold that, the claimant is entitled to amount of Rs.60,000/­ towards bills of medicines. Resultantly, the claimant is entitled to compensation to the tune of Rs.5,34,000/­ on all counts (Rs.2,64,000+Rs.25,000+ Rs.15,000 + Rs.20,000+Rs.1,50,000+Rs.60,000). 23.The Claimant has claimed interest @ 18% p.a. On the amount of compensation. However, Now a days 15 M.A.C.P. No..278/2015 [Judgment] nationalized banks are giving interest at the rate of 7 to 8% on fixed deposits. Therefore, considering the period of accident, in my opinion, claimant is entitled to interest at the rate of 8% per annum on the amount of compensation. 24.It can be seen from Form Comp.AA (Exh.49) that, the offending truck bearing registration No. AP­16­TT­5277 was owned by respondent No.2, driven by respondent No.3 and insured with respondent No.1 at the time of accident. The insurance cover note (Exh.43) shows that, the truck bearing registration No.AP­16­TT­5277 was validly insured with respondent No.1­Insurance Company during the period 20.08.2014 till 19.08.2015. The accident took place on 08.03.2015. Therefore, on the date of accident, the offending truck was insured with respondent No.1. Therefore, respondent Nos. 1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the claimant. Hence, I answer issue No.3 accordingly as mentioned against it and in answer of issue No.4, pass following order :­ 16 M.A.C.P. No..278/2015 [Judgment] ORDER 1]The Petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs as under :­ a)The respondent Nos. 1 to 3 do pay Rs.5,34,000/­ (Rs. Five Lakh Thirty­four Thousand only) jointly and severally to the claimant alongwith interest @ 8% per annum from the date of the petition till its realization. b)On deposit of compensation amount in the office of this Tribunal, 50% amount be kept in Fixed Deposit in the name of the claimant in any Nationalized Bank of her choice for the period of three years. The claimant shall be at liberty to get the quarterly interest accrued on the amount of deposit, if desired. Remaining 50% amount of the compensation be given to the claimant by Account Payee Cheque in her name on due identification. 2]Award be drawn accordingly. Sd/­ (V.H.

No.328/2015 [Judgment] ___________________________________________ _____ Shri Mohsin Kazi, Advocate for claimant S.G. Chapalgaonkar, Advocate for respondent No.1 Shri T.S. Chavare Patil,Advocate for respondent Nos.2 and 3 _________________________________________________ JUDGMENT (Delivered on :20.02.2018) 1.The present petition is filed under Section 166 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 seeking compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- due to permanent disability sustained by Shaikh Ayyub Shaikh Gani in motor vehicular accident. 2.Brief facts of the petition, are as under :- The accident took place on 23.01.2015 at about 17.45 hours on Paithan to Pachod road. At the time of accident, claimant was travelling on motorcycle as a pillion rider. At that time, one TATA Safari vehicle bearing registration No.MH-20-AY-2122 (hereinafter referred to as 'the offending vehicle') came from back side in rash and negligent manner, without following traffic rules and gave dash to the motorcycle. In said accident, claimant sustained multiple bodily injuries. Immediately after the accident, he was shifted to Government Medical College and Hospital, Aurangabad for medical treatment. He was indoor patient thereat (CNR:MHAU-01-002076-2015) 3 M.A.C.P. No.328/2015 [Judgment] from 23.01.2015 to 31.01.2015 and expended amount of Rs.1,50,000/- for his medical treatment. 3.After accident, Crime No.I-12/2015 u/s. 279, 337,338,304-A,427 of The Indian Penal Code and u/s. 184/177 of The Motor Vehicles Act came to be registered at police station, Pachod, Dist.Aurangabad against driver of the offending vehicle. 4.At the time of accident, claimant was 25 years old. Occupationally, claimant was driver and was getting monthly income of Rs.8,000/-. Out of said income he was maintaining himself and his family. However, due to accidental injuries and permanent disablement, he cannot do his work. Therefore, claimant and his family are facing hard days and troubles in day today life. At the time of accident, respondent No.1 was insurer, respondent No.2 was owner and respondent No.3 was driver of the offending vehicle. He claimed compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- alongwith interest from respondent Nos. 1 to 3 jointly and severally. 5.Respondent No.1 filed its written statement/say at Exh.15 and denied contents of the petition. It is denied that, at the time of accident, claimant was 25 years of age and was earning (CNR:MHAU-01-002076-2015) 4 M.A.C.P. No.328/2015 [Judgment] Rs.8,000/- per month from the work of driving. It is denied that, the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of driver of the offending vehicle. It is denied that, in the accident, claimant sustained multiple bodily injuries and he was indoor patient in Government Hospital from 23.01.2015 to 31.01.2015. Involvement of the offending vehicle is denied by this respondent. It is contended that, claimant was rider of motorcycle and due to his own negligence the accident took place. It is denied that, after accident, claimant incurred expenses of Rs.1,50,000/- for his medical treatment. At the time of accident, claimant was travelling on motorcycle alongwith two persons. Therefore, the accident took place as the motorcycle rider could not control it. Hence, in this case, principle of contributory negligence be applied. At the time of accident, driver of the offending vehicle was not holding valid and effective driving license. So, there is breach of terms and conditions of insurance policy. Lastly, it is prayed to dismiss the petition. 6.Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 have filed their written statement/say at Exh. 10 and denied contents of the petition. However, it is admitted that, at the time of accident, the offending (CNR:MHAU-01-002076-2015) 5 M.A.C.P. No.328/2015 [Judgment] vehicle was driven by respondent No.3, owned by respondent No.2 and insured with respondent No.1. Claimant has claimed excessive amount of compensation. It is denied that, the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No. 3. On the contrary, the accident took place due to mistake of rider of the motorcycle. It is denied that, after accident, claimant took medical treatment at Government hospital and incurred expenses of Rs.1,50,000/-. Age, occupation and income of claimant at the relevant time is denied. Respondent No.3 is having valid and effective driving license to drive the vehicle. As such, respondent No.2 has not committed any breach of terms and conditions of insurance policy. If claimant found entitled to compensation, in that event, it may be ordered to be recovered from respondent No.1. Lastly, it is prayed to dismiss the petition. 7.Following issues are framed at Exh. 19. I record my findings thereon for the reasons stated thereafter. ISSUES FINDINGS 1.Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of TATA Safari vehicle bearing registration No. MH-20-AY-2122 by its driver ?In the affirmative (CNR:MHAU-01-002076-2015) 6 M.A.C.P. No.328/2015 [Judgment] 2.Whether the claimant sustained permanent disability due to the injuries suffered by him in said accident ?In the affirmative. To the extent of 10% 3.Whether the claimant is entitled to get compensation ? If yes, from whom and to what extent ?In the affirmative. From respondent Nos.1 to 3 jointly & severally 4.What order ? As per final order REASONS 8.In order to substantiate claim petition, the claimant has filed his affidavit of examination-in-chief at Exh. 20. He has also examined Dr. P.SJaiswal (CW-2) at Exh.21. Apart from this, claimant has filed on record certified copies of FIR (Exh.28), Spot panchnama (Exh.29), Motor driving license of respondent No.3 (Exh.30), Insurance policy of the offending vehicle (Exh.31), Discharge Card (Exh.32) and Form Comp.B (Exh.21). AS TO ISSUE No.1 :- 9.Claimant deposed on the line of his petition in his affidavit of examination-in-chief at Exh. 20. During his cross- examination by respondent No.1, he denied all adverse suggestions. He stated that, he was pillion rider on the motorcycle. His father (CNR:MHAU-01-002076-2015) 7 M.A.C.P. No.328/2015 [Judgment] was having valid driving license to drive motorcycle. He denied that, after sustaining permanent disability he is doing the work that he was doing prior to the accident. In short, evidence of claimant, that he sustained permanent disability due to accidental injuries is not falsified. 10.FIR (Exh.28) shows that, on 23.01.2015 i.e. on the date of accident, complaint was lodged against driver of the offending vehicle. Spot panchnama (Exh.29) shows that, the offending vehicle gave dash to motorcycle bearing registration No.MH-20- AY-2122 from back side. Said motorcycle is seen in damaged condition. On kaccha road, near the spot, blood is seen. Spot panchnama substantiates factum of accident. Discharge Card (Exh.32) issued by Government Medical College and Hospital, Aurangabad shows that, on 23.01.2015 i.e on the date of accident, claimant was admitted in said hospital and was discharged on 31.01.2015. 11. Concerned police investigated the case and registered offence under Sections 279,337,338,304-A,427 of the I.P.C. at Pachod police station, Aurangabad, against driver of the offending vehicle. Registration of offence against respondent No.3 prima (CNR:MHAU-01-002076-2015) 8 M.A.C.P. No.328/2015 [Judgment] facie shows his negligence. Police papers filed on record are not denied by the respondents. In the wake of above discussion, it is held that, the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No.3. Hence, I answer issue No. 1 accordingly in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO. 2 :- 12.In order to prove permanent disability sustained in the accident, the claimant has examined Dr. P.S. Jaiswal (CW-2) at Exh.21. He deposed that, he examined the claimant on 15.06.2016 clinically and also saw his old papers. He found that, the claimant sustained head injury with CLW left temporal region. The wound was debrided and head injury was treated conservatively. Now the claimant has scar at left temporal region measuring 9x6 cm. Now he has headache and giddiness. Patient says he has less memory than before. This witness assessed 20% permanent disability to claimant and accordingly issued permanent disability certificate (Exh.22). 13.During cross-examination by Advocate for respondent No.1, this witness denied the suggestion that, giddiness and (CNR:MHAU-01-002076-2015) 9 M.A.C.P. No.328/2015 [Judgment] headache do not constitute permanent disability. He further stated that, he came to know that, by profession, claimant is a tractor driver. Due to permanent disability, claimant cannot drive tractor in future. 14.It is specific case of claimant that, before accident, he was driver and was getting monthly income of Rs.8,000/-. Claimant has filed on record copy of learner license and receipt issued by RTO Office, Aurangabad. It is clear from said document that, claimant was driver on tractor. Dr. Jaiswal stated that, due to permanent disability, on account of giddiness and headache, claimant cannot drive tractor in future. Considering nature of injury and work of claimant that he was doing prior to accident, it would be just and proper to held that, claimant suffered 10% permanent disability due to accidental injuries. Accordingly, I answer Issue No. 2 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO. 3 :- 15. It is discussed while answering issue Nos.1 and 2 that, the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle and due to the accidental injuries, claimant (CNR:MHAU-01-002076-2015) 10 M.A.C.P. No.328/2015 [Judgment] sustained permanent disability. Therefore, the claimant is entitled to get compensation. 16. Claimant has deposed in his evidence that, before the accident, he was driver on a tractor and was earning Rs.8,000/- per month. However, he has not filed on record documentary proof showing his aforementioned monthly income. Therefore, for want of evidence about income of claimant, it would be just and proper to take notional income of claimant for the purpose of computation of compensation. Considering the period of accident as well as rates of wages prevalent at that time, notional income of claimant is taken as Rs.5,000/- per month. Thus, annual income of the claimant comes to Rs.60,000/- (Rs.5,000 x 12). 17.Claimant has contended in his petition as well as in affidavit of evidence that, at the time of accident, he was 25 years old. However, he has not filed on record any document showing his date of birth. Discharge card (Exh.32) issued by Government Medical College and Hospital, Aurangabad shows age of claimant as 25 years. Therefore, I hold that, claimant was 25 years of age at the time of accident. In view of the ratio laid down by The Hon'ble (CNR:MHAU-01-002076-2015) 11 M.A.C.P. No.328/2015 [Judgment] Supreme Court in the case of Sarla Verma & ors. vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & Anr., 2009 ACJ 1298, multiplier of 18 will have to be taken. After applying said multiplier, future loss of earning of claimant would be Rs. 10,80,000/-(Rs.60,000 x 18). 18.While answering Issue No.2, it is held that, claimant has sustained 10% permanent disability due to the accidental injuries. Therefore, he is entitled to compensation of Rs.1,08,000/- (10% of Rs.10,80,000/-). 19.In addition to this, claimant is entitled to the amount of Rs.15,000/- for pain and sufferings and Rs.10,000/-for attendant charges, transportation charges and special diet etc. Thus, claimant is entitled to compensation to the tune of Rs.1,33,000/-, on all counts. 20.From the police papers on record, it is clear that, at the time of accident, the offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.1, owned by respondent No.2 and driven by respondent No.3. Therefore, respondent Nos.1 to 3 are held jointly and severally liable to pay amount of compensation of Rs.1,33,000/- to claimant. (CNR:MHAU-01-002076-2015) 12 M.A.C.P. No.328/2015 [Judgment] Hence, I answer Issue No. 3 as mentioned against it and in answer to Issue No.4, pass following order. ORDER The Petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs as under :- 1]Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 do pay Rs.1,33,000/- (Rs.One Lakh Thirty-three Thousand only) jointly and severally to the claimant alongwith interest @ 8% per annum from the date of the petition till its realization. 2]On deposit of compensation amount in the office of this Tribunal, it be given to the claimant by Account Payee Cheque in his name. 3]Award be drawn accordingly.

No.328/2015 [Judgment] ___________________________________________ _____ Shri Mohsin Kazi, Advocate for claimant S.G. Chapalgaonkar, Advocate for respondent No.1 Shri T.S. Chavare Patil,Advocate for respondent Nos.2 and 3 _________________________________________________ JUDGMENT (Delivered on :20.02.2018) 1.The present petition is filed under Section 166 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 seeking compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- due to permanent disability sustained by Shaikh Ayyub Shaikh Gani in motor vehicular accident. 2.Brief facts of the petition, are as under :- The accident took place on 23.01.2015 at about 17.45 hours on Paithan to Pachod road. At the time of accident, claimant was travelling on motorcycle as a pillion rider. At that time, one TATA Safari vehicle bearing registration No.MH-20-AY-2122 (hereinafter referred to as 'the offending vehicle') came from back side in rash and negligent manner, without following traffic rules and gave dash to the motorcycle. In said accident, claimant sustained multiple bodily injuries. Immediately after the accident, he was shifted to Government Medical College and Hospital, Aurangabad for medical treatment. He was indoor patient thereat (CNR:MHAU-01-002076-2015) 3 M.A.C.P. No.328/2015 [Judgment] from 23.01.2015 to 31.01.2015 and expended amount of Rs.1,50,000/- for his medical treatment. 3.After accident, Crime No.I-12/2015 u/s. 279, 337,338,304-A,427 of The Indian Penal Code and u/s. 184/177 of The Motor Vehicles Act came to be registered at police station, Pachod, Dist.Aurangabad against driver of the offending vehicle. 4.At the time of accident, claimant was 25 years old. Occupationally, claimant was driver and was getting monthly income of Rs.8,000/-. Out of said income he was maintaining himself and his family. However, due to accidental injuries and permanent disablement, he cannot do his work. Therefore, claimant and his family are facing hard days and troubles in day today life. At the time of accident, respondent No.1 was insurer, respondent No.2 was owner and respondent No.3 was driver of the offending vehicle. He claimed compensation of Rs.2,00,000/- alongwith interest from respondent Nos. 1 to 3 jointly and severally. 5.Respondent No.1 filed its written statement/say at Exh.15 and denied contents of the petition. It is denied that, at the time of accident, claimant was 25 years of age and was earning (CNR:MHAU-01-002076-2015) 4 M.A.C.P. No.328/2015 [Judgment] Rs.8,000/- per month from the work of driving. It is denied that, the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of driver of the offending vehicle. It is denied that, in the accident, claimant sustained multiple bodily injuries and he was indoor patient in Government Hospital from 23.01.2015 to 31.01.2015. Involvement of the offending vehicle is denied by this respondent. It is contended that, claimant was rider of motorcycle and due to his own negligence the accident took place. It is denied that, after accident, claimant incurred expenses of Rs.1,50,000/- for his medical treatment. At the time of accident, claimant was travelling on motorcycle alongwith two persons. Therefore, the accident took place as the motorcycle rider could not control it. Hence, in this case, principle of contributory negligence be applied. At the time of accident, driver of the offending vehicle was not holding valid and effective driving license. So, there is breach of terms and conditions of insurance policy. Lastly, it is prayed to dismiss the petition. 6.Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 have filed their written statement/say at Exh. 10 and denied contents of the petition. However, it is admitted that, at the time of accident, the offending (CNR:MHAU-01-002076-2015) 5 M.A.C.P. No.328/2015 [Judgment] vehicle was driven by respondent No.3, owned by respondent No.2 and insured with respondent No.1. Claimant has claimed excessive amount of compensation. It is denied that, the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No. 3. On the contrary, the accident took place due to mistake of rider of the motorcycle. It is denied that, after accident, claimant took medical treatment at Government hospital and incurred expenses of Rs.1,50,000/-. Age, occupation and income of claimant at the relevant time is denied. Respondent No.3 is having valid and effective driving license to drive the vehicle. As such, respondent No.2 has not committed any breach of terms and conditions of insurance policy. If claimant found entitled to compensation, in that event, it may be ordered to be recovered from respondent No.1. Lastly, it is prayed to dismiss the petition. 7.Following issues are framed at Exh. 19. I record my findings thereon for the reasons stated thereafter. ISSUES FINDINGS 1.Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of TATA Safari vehicle bearing registration No. MH-20-AY-2122 by its driver ?In the affirmative (CNR:MHAU-01-002076-2015) 6 M.A.C.P. No.328/2015 [Judgment] 2.Whether the claimant sustained permanent disability due to the injuries suffered by him in said accident ?In the affirmative. To the extent of 10% 3.Whether the claimant is entitled to get compensation ? If yes, from whom and to what extent ?In the affirmative. From respondent Nos.1 to 3 jointly & severally 4.What order ? As per final order REASONS 8.In order to substantiate claim petition, the claimant has filed his affidavit of examination-in-chief at Exh. 20. He has also examined Dr. P.SJaiswal (CW-2) at Exh.21. Apart from this, claimant has filed on record certified copies of FIR (Exh.28), Spot panchnama (Exh.29), Motor driving license of respondent No.3 (Exh.30), Insurance policy of the offending vehicle (Exh.31), Discharge Card (Exh.32) and Form Comp.B (Exh.21). AS TO ISSUE No.1 :- 9.Claimant deposed on the line of his petition in his affidavit of examination-in-chief at Exh. 20. During his cross- examination by respondent No.1, he denied all adverse suggestions. He stated that, he was pillion rider on the motorcycle. His father (CNR:MHAU-01-002076-2015) 7 M.A.C.P. No.328/2015 [Judgment] was having valid driving license to drive motorcycle. He denied that, after sustaining permanent disability he is doing the work that he was doing prior to the accident. In short, evidence of claimant, that he sustained permanent disability due to accidental injuries is not falsified. 10.FIR (Exh.28) shows that, on 23.01.2015 i.e. on the date of accident, complaint was lodged against driver of the offending vehicle. Spot panchnama (Exh.29) shows that, the offending vehicle gave dash to motorcycle bearing registration No.MH-20- AY-2122 from back side. Said motorcycle is seen in damaged condition. On kaccha road, near the spot, blood is seen. Spot panchnama substantiates factum of accident. Discharge Card (Exh.32) issued by Government Medical College and Hospital, Aurangabad shows that, on 23.01.2015 i.e on the date of accident, claimant was admitted in said hospital and was discharged on 31.01.2015. 11. Concerned police investigated the case and registered offence under Sections 279,337,338,304-A,427 of the I.P.C. at Pachod police station, Aurangabad, against driver of the offending vehicle. Registration of offence against respondent No.3 prima (CNR:MHAU-01-002076-2015) 8 M.A.C.P. No.328/2015 [Judgment] facie shows his negligence. Police papers filed on record are not denied by the respondents. In the wake of above discussion, it is held that, the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No.3. Hence, I answer issue No. 1 accordingly in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO. 2 :- 12.In order to prove permanent disability sustained in the accident, the claimant has examined Dr. P.S. Jaiswal (CW-2) at Exh.21. He deposed that, he examined the claimant on 15.06.2016 clinically and also saw his old papers. He found that, the claimant sustained head injury with CLW left temporal region. The wound was debrided and head injury was treated conservatively. Now the claimant has scar at left temporal region measuring 9x6 cm. Now he has headache and giddiness. Patient says he has less memory than before. This witness assessed 20% permanent disability to claimant and accordingly issued permanent disability certificate (Exh.22). 13.During cross-examination by Advocate for respondent No.1, this witness denied the suggestion that, giddiness and (CNR:MHAU-01-002076-2015) 9 M.A.C.P. No.328/2015 [Judgment] headache do not constitute permanent disability. He further stated that, he came to know that, by profession, claimant is a tractor driver. Due to permanent disability, claimant cannot drive tractor in future. 14.It is specific case of claimant that, before accident, he was driver and was getting monthly income of Rs.8,000/-. Claimant has filed on record copy of learner license and receipt issued by RTO Office, Aurangabad. It is clear from said document that, claimant was driver on tractor. Dr. Jaiswal stated that, due to permanent disability, on account of giddiness and headache, claimant cannot drive tractor in future. Considering nature of injury and work of claimant that he was doing prior to accident, it would be just and proper to held that, claimant suffered 10% permanent disability due to accidental injuries. Accordingly, I answer Issue No. 2 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO. 3 :- 15. It is discussed while answering issue Nos.1 and 2 that, the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle and due to the accidental injuries, claimant (CNR:MHAU-01-002076-2015) 10 M.A.C.P. No.328/2015 [Judgment] sustained permanent disability. Therefore, the claimant is entitled to get compensation. 16. Claimant has deposed in his evidence that, before the accident, he was driver on a tractor and was earning Rs.8,000/- per month. However, he has not filed on record documentary proof showing his aforementioned monthly income. Therefore, for want of evidence about income of claimant, it would be just and proper to take notional income of claimant for the purpose of computation of compensation. Considering the period of accident as well as rates of wages prevalent at that time, notional income of claimant is taken as Rs.5,000/- per month. Thus, annual income of the claimant comes to Rs.60,000/- (Rs.5,000 x 12). 17.Claimant has contended in his petition as well as in affidavit of evidence that, at the time of accident, he was 25 years old. However, he has not filed on record any document showing his date of birth. Discharge card (Exh.32) issued by Government Medical College and Hospital, Aurangabad shows age of claimant as 25 years. Therefore, I hold that, claimant was 25 years of age at the time of accident. In view of the ratio laid down by The Hon'ble (CNR:MHAU-01-002076-2015) 11 M.A.C.P. No.328/2015 [Judgment] Supreme Court in the case of Sarla Verma & ors. vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & Anr., 2009 ACJ 1298, multiplier of 18 will have to be taken. After applying said multiplier, future loss of earning of claimant would be Rs. 10,80,000/-(Rs.60,000 x 18). 18.While answering Issue No.2, it is held that, claimant has sustained 10% permanent disability due to the accidental injuries. Therefore, he is entitled to compensation of Rs.1,08,000/- (10% of Rs.10,80,000/-). 19.In addition to this, claimant is entitled to the amount of Rs.15,000/- for pain and sufferings and Rs.10,000/-for attendant charges, transportation charges and special diet etc. Thus, claimant is entitled to compensation to the tune of Rs.1,33,000/-, on all counts. 20.From the police papers on record, it is clear that, at the time of accident, the offending vehicle was insured with respondent No.1, owned by respondent No.2 and driven by respondent No.3. Therefore, respondent Nos.1 to 3 are held jointly and severally liable to pay amount of compensation of Rs.1,33,000/- to claimant. (CNR:MHAU-01-002076-2015) 12 M.A.C.P. No.328/2015 [Judgment] Hence, I answer Issue No. 3 as mentioned against it and in answer to Issue No.4, pass following order. ORDER The Petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs as under :- 1]Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 do pay Rs.1,33,000/- (Rs.One Lakh Thirty-three Thousand only) jointly and severally to the claimant alongwith interest @ 8% per annum from the date of the petition till its realization. 2]On deposit of compensation amount in the office of this Tribunal, it be given to the claimant by Account Payee Cheque in his name. 3]Award be drawn accordingly.

ISSUE NO.2 : 21.In view of answering issue no.1 in the affirmative, the claimants being the legal representatives of deceased Vithal are entitled to claim compensation. As per the inquest panchnama and the postmortem report, deceased Vithal was 55 years old. The claimants did not produce any document of age proof or income proof. The claimants claimed that deceased Vithal was working as a labour in the Sugar­cane Factory. 22.In the light of aforesaid facts and circumstances the age of deceased Vithal is taken 55 years old. Considering the totality of .. 7 .. MACP NO.284/2015 (Judgment) circumstances, the income of deceased Vithal is taken Rs.7,000/­ per month. 23.As per the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of “Sarla Varma V/s Delhi Transport” , 1/3rd amount needs to be deducted towards personal expenses of deceased Vithal and the multiplier of 11 is to be applied for calculating the compensation. The learned Counsel, Shri.Osmanpurkar for the respondent no.1 submitted during the course of argument that for want of pleading and evidence, future prospects can not be granted. He relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of “ The New India Assurance Co.Ltd V/s Smt.Alpa Rajesh Shaha,reported in 2014(2) Mh.L.J.17” . In the said case the Hon'ble Bombay High Court held that there is no prohibition to consider the future prospects of increase in the earning of deceased, though deceased was self employed. However, the claimants are required to produce satisfactory evidence to show that there were genuine prospects of increase or enhancing in the earning of deceased. 24.The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the case of “Rajesh and Ors. V/s Rajbir Singh and Ors, 2013(6) SCALE 563 (S.C.) ”, held that future prospects @ 15% needs to be added if the deceased was between 50 years to 60 years old. .. 8 .. MACP NO.284/2015 (Judgment) 25.In the case in hand, deceased Vithal was not carrying any self­business. He was working as a labour in the Sugar­cane Factory. 26.Taking into consideration, the observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of “Rajesh and Ors. V/s Rajbir Singh and Ors”, and the nature of the job of deceased Vithal and his age, 15% addition needs to be given towards future prospects. 27.The compensation is accordingly calculated as follows –Annual Income of deceased ­­ Rs.7,000/­x12= Rs.84,000/­ –1/3rd deduction towards personal expenses – Rs.84,000/­ – 28,000/­ = Rs.56,000/­. (Net annual loss of income) –Addition of 15% future prospects – Rs.56,000/­ + 8,400/­ = Rs.64,400/­. (Total annual loss of income) –Total loss of dependency – Rs.64,400/­ x 11 = Rs,7,08,400/­. 28.The claimant no.1 being widow is entitled for Rs.1 Lac towards loss of consortium, claimant no.2 and 3 are entitled for Rs.50,000/­ each towards loss of care and protection and the claimants are entitled for Rs.25,000/­ towards funeral expenses. 29.The claimants are entitled for total compensation .. 9 .. MACP NO.284/2015 (Judgment) Rs.9,33,400. I accordingly answer issue no.2. ISSUE NO.3 : 30.The claimant is entitled to recover the said amount of compensation jointly and severally from the respondent nos.1 to 3. 31.As per the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of “Rajesh and Ors. V/s Rajbir Singh and Ors ”, the claimants are also entitled for interest @ 8 % p.a. from the date of petition. Accordingly I answer issue no.3 and proceed to pass the following order. O R D E R 1)The claim is allowed with costs. 2)The respondent nos.1, 2 and 3 are directed jointly and severally to pay Rs.9,33,400/­ along with interest @ 8% p.a. from the date of petition till actual payment after deducting the NFL amount, if paid. 3)Out of this total amount including interest and costs, Rs.4,66,700/­ be paid to the claimant no.1, out of which, Rs.2,25,000/­ be deposited in fixed deposit in any Nationalized Bank in her name for five years. 4)Out of the aforesaid total amount Rs.2,33,350/­ each be paid to the claimant nos.2 and 3, out of which Rs.1,25,000/­ each be deposited in fixed deposit in any Nationalized Bank in their names for five years. .. 10 ..

Pungle, Advocate for claimants Shri A.S. Usmanpurkar, Advocate for respondent No.1. Exparte against respondent Nos.2 and 3 ______________________________________________ JUDGMENT (Delivered on : 14.11.2017) 1.This claim petition is filed under Section 166 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 seeking compensation of Rs.5,00,000/- due to death of Pradeep Pandharinath Kakde in motor vehicular accident. 2.Brief facts of this petition are as under :- On 16.01.2015, son of the claimants namely, Pradeep Pandharinath Kakde was travelling on motorcycle bearing registration No.MH-20-CM-9488 as a pillion rider. Said motorcycle was driven by his friend Sagar Rambhau Kothale in slow and moderate speed, by following traffic rules and 3 M.A.C.P. No.113/2015 [Judgment] regulations. When they reached on Kannad to Chalisgaon road, on the turn of village Ambadi percolation tank, near village Gopalwadi, Tq. Kannad, at about 16.25 hours, at that time, one truck bearing registration No. GJ-10-Z-9230 came from opposite direction, driven by respondent No.3 in rash and negligent manner, gave dash to the motorcycle. In said accident, the rider as well as pillion rider of said motorcycle sustained serious bodily injuries. Pradeep Kakde was shifted to Government Hospital at Kannad, where the medical officer after examination declared him as dead. Accordingly, the postmortem was conducted. 3.The police authorities of Kannad police station, Dist. Aurangabad registered offence punishable under Section 279,,337,338, 304-A of The Indian Penal Code vide crime No. I- 17/2015 against driver of the motorcycle and the truck. 4.Deceased Pradeep was 21 years old at the time of accident. He was taking education in the second year of Diploma of Agriculture with Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Krushi Vidyapeeth, Parbhani, Krushi Tantra Niketan, Pathri, Tq. 4 M.A.C.P. No.113/2015 [Judgment] Phulambri, Dist. Aurangabad. He was brilliant in his study and was having hopes to become class-I officer by completing his education. However, due to untimely sad demise of the deceased, the claimant sustained great mental shock and agony. The claimants have deprived of love and affection of their deceased son. The loss caused to the claimants will not be counted in any means. But, for the purpose of survival in future, the claimants claimed that, they are entitled to compensation amount from the respondents to the tune of Rs.34,30,000/- under different heads. However, they have restricted their claim to Rs.5,00,000/-. 5.The accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the truck by respondent No.3. Said truck was owned by respondent No.2 and was validly insured with respondent No.1 at the time of accident. Hence, the claimants claimed compensation of Rs.5,00,000/- alongwith interest @18% p.a. from respondent Nos.1 to 3 jointly and severally. 6.Respondent No.1 filed its written statement at Exh. 14 and denied contents of the petition. It is contended that, driver 5 M.A.C.P. No.113/2015 [Judgment] of the truck was not holding valid and effective driving license at the time of accident. Respondent No.2 has handed over said truck to the driver. Therefore, there is breach of terms of insurance policy. The truck was being used without valid and effective permit and fitness certificate. Therefore, respondent No.1 is not liable to pay compensation. The truck was goods carrying-public carrier vehicle and it was being used for other than goods carrying purpose. The claimants have claimed excessive rate of interest i.e. 18% p.a. It is denied that, the truck was involved in the alleged accident and the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the truck. Age, income and occupation of the deceased is denied. It is denied that, the crime is registered against driver of the truck at Kannad police station. The accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the motorcycle by its rider. Driver of the motorcycle and the deceased were under the influence of liquor, and therefore, due to rash and negligent driving of the motorcycle, the accident took place. It is further contended that, there was an accident between these two vehicles in the form of head on collision. Therefore, in the alternative, it is submitted that, it is a case of contributory negligence and as such this respondent 6 M.A.C.P. No.113/2015 [Judgment] is not liable to pay entire amount of the claim. Owner and Insurance Company of motorcycle are not made parties to this petition. The claimants have claimed excessive and exorbitant amount of compensation from the respondents. Lastly, it is prayed to dismiss the petition with costs. 7.Respondent Nos. 2 and 3 were duly served, but remained absence. Hence, the petition proceeded exparte against them. 8.Following issues are framed at Exh.21. I record my findings thereon for the reasons stated thereafter. ISSUES FINDINGS 1.Whether due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing registration No. GJ-10-Z-9230 the accident occurred and as a consequence thereof Pradeep Pandharinath Kakde died ?In the affirmative 2.Whether the claimants are entitled to get compensation ? If yes, what should be the quantum ?In the affirmative 3.Who is liable to pay compensation ? Respondent Nos.1 to 3 jointly and severally 4.What award ? As per final order 7 M.A.C.P. No.113/2015 [Judgment] REASONS 9.In order to substantiate the claim petition, on behalf of the claimants, claimant No.2 Pandharinath s/o Dhondiba Kakde filed his affidavit of examination-in-chief at Exh. 22. Apart from this, the claimants have filed on record certified copies of FIR (Exh.26), Spot panchnama (Exh.27), Inquest panchnama (Exh.28), Certificate of registration of the truck (Exh.29), Insurance cover note in the name of respondent No.2 i.e. owner of the truck (Exh.33), Original school leaving certificate of deceased Pradeep Kakde (Exh. 30), Marksheet of deceased Pradeep Kakde for the Diploma Course in Agriculture Technology for the first year (Exh. 31), Form Comp.AA (Exh.32) and copies of driving license of truck driver, Adhar card of claimant No.1, etc on record. AS TO ISSUE NO.1 :- 10. Claimant No.2 has reiterated contents of the petition in his affidavit of examination-in-chief. During cross-examination by Advocate for respondent No.1, he admitted that, the offence is registered against drivers of the motorcycle and the truck. He 8 M.A.C.P. No.113/2015 [Judgment] cannot tell whether the accident took place due to negligence of drivers of both the vehicles. 11.During cross-examination of this witness by Insurance Company, nothing could be elicited to falsify occurrence of the accident. He denied all adverse suggestions during his cross- examination. Testimony of this witness on the point of accident is not refuted by the respondent during his cross-examination. FIR is lodged at Kannad police station against drivers of both the vehicles for rash and negligent driving. 12.Recitals of spot panchnama (Exh. 27) show that, the spot of accident is located at 5 k.m. away from Kannad police station on Kannad-Chalisgaon road near Gopalwadi. There also appears brake-marks of tyres of the truck for about 8 to 12 feet on road. Tale light of the motorcycle is seen broken. Blood is seen towards western side of brake-marks on road. The motorcycle is seen standing at 300 meters away from the spot of accident. Steering, left handle grip, clutch as well as both foot-rests, Sari- guard of the motorcycle is seen crushed towards its left side. There is mark of brushing towards extreme end of right side of the truck. 9 M.A.C.P. No.113/2015 [Judgment] The spot panchnama shows involvement of both the vehicles in the accident. As per FIR (Exh. 26), after the accident, the truck driver fled away towards Chalisgaon. When stopped by the people, he fled leaving the truck. This conduct prima facie shows that, he is responsible for the accident. 13.Respondent No. 1 has not adduced any rebuttal evidence. Concerned police after investigation, registered crime against drivers of both the vehicles. As per recitals of first information report, conduct of respondent No.3 after occurrence of accident, prima facie shows that, he is guilty for the accident. Perusal of record shows that, the driver of the truck has not challenged the charges levelled against him. So also, he did not step into the witness box to prove his innocence. The police papers filed on record are not denied by the respondents. 14.Inquest panchnama (Exh.28) shows that, Pradeep Kakde died on 16.01.2015 at 18.00 hours i.e. on the date of the accident and the probable cause of death is grievous injury to head and other parts of body in accident. In the light of above 10 M.A.C.P. No.113/2015 [Judgment] discussion, it is held that, the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing registration No. GJ-10-9230 and in said accident, Pradeep Kakde died. Accordingly, I answer issue No.1 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO. 2 & 3 :- 15.Claimant No.1 is mother and claimant No.2 is father of deceased Pradeep Kakde. The relations between the parties are not disputed. Claimant No.2 Pandharinath Kakde admitted in his cross-examination that, he is an agriculturist. He is having 3 Acres agricultural land. He maintain his family from the income of agricultural land. In this regard, learned Advocate for respondent- Insurance Company argued that, as respondent No.2 has his own income, he is not dependent on income of the deceased. In the light of admission given by claimant No.2 in his cross-examination, I find substance in the argument of learned Advocate for respondent No.1 that, claimant No.2 is not dependent on income of the deceased. Therefore, he will not get amount of compensation, if any, equally as compared to claimant No.1 on account of accidental death of Pradeep Kakde. 11 M.A.C.P. No.113/2015 [Judgment] 16.The claimants have contended in their petition that, deceased Pradeep was taking education in Second Year of Diploma in Agriculture in Vasantrao Naik Marathwada Krushi Vidyapeeth, Parbhani, Krushi Tantra Niketan, Pathri, Tq. Phulambri, Dist. Aurangabad. He was brilliant in his study. He was having hopes to become class-I officer by completing his education. It is a fact that, there is nothing on record to show income of deceased Pradeep. At this juncture, it cannot be said that, what Pradeep would have become in future, had he not been died in the accident. In the circumstances, it would be just and proper to take notional income of the deceased for computation of compensation. Considering facts of the case, notional income of the deceased is taken as Rs. 4,000/- per month. 17.Deceased Pradeep was bachelor at the time of accident. Therefore, one-half of amount of his income should be deducted for his personal expenses. After said deduction, monthly loss of income would be Rs.2,000/-. Annual loss of dependency would be Rs.24,000/- (Rs.2,000 x 12). 18.Learned Advocate for the respondent-Insurance 12 M.A.C.P. No.113/2015 [Judgment] Company argued that, at the time of applying multiplier, age of the claimants be taken into consideration instead of age of the deceased. In this regard, he relied on the case between Meena & Ors. Vs. Rani Ammal & Anr., MANU/SCOR/07223/2017 , wherein it is held that, ordinarily, in the case of death of a bachelor, age of the dependent parents should be taken for determining the multiplier. 19.Per contra, learned Advocate for the claimants argued that, in case of death of a bachelor, appropriate multiplier would be considering age of the deceased. In this regard, he relied on the case between Kempaiah Vs. S.S. Murthy, AIR 2017 SC 1822 . In this case, the deceased has left behind his father of 40 years age and mother of 38 years age and a sister of 17 years of age. The Hon'ble Apex Court adopted multiplier of 18 considering age of the deceased i.e. 20 years at the time of his death. 20.That apart, very recently, the Hon'ble Apex Court in the case between National Insurance Co.Ltd. Vs. Pranay Sethi & Ors. in Special Leave Petition (Civil) No.25590 of 2014, decided on 31.10.2017 held that, age of the deceased should be 13 M.A.C.P. No.113/2015 [Judgment] the basis for applying the multiplier. 21.In the light of above discussion, I find force in the arguments of learned Advocate for the claimants and with high respect, the case law relied on by learned Advocate for respondent- Insurance Company is not applicable to this case. Therefore, in this case, appropriate multiplier should be according to the age of the deceased at the time of the accident. 22.The claimants have contended in their petition age of the deceased as 21 years at the time of accident. The school leaving certificate of deceased Pradeep (Exh. 30) shows his date of birth as 21.07.1994. The accident occurred on 16.01.2015. It means, deceased Pradeep was 20 years old at the time of accident. So, as per the ratio laid down by The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sarla Verma & Ors. vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & Anr., 2009 ACJ 1298, multiplier of 18 will have to be taken. After applying said multiplier, amount of compensation comes to Rs.4,32,000/- (Rs.24,000 x 18). 23.Apart from this, claimants are entitled to Rs.15,000/- 14 M.A.C.P. No.113/2015 [Judgment] for loss of love and affection. The claimants are also entitled to Rs.15,000/- for funeral expenses. Thus, the claimants are entitled to total amount of compensation of Rs.4,62,000/- on all counts. 24.Learned Advocate for respondent No.1 further argued that, as offence is registered against both drivers of motorcycle as well as the truck. Therefore, contributory negligence of both drivers be taken into consideration. 25.On the contrary, learned Advocate for the claimants argued that, though offence is registered against both the drivers, the deceased was at the time of accident travelling on motorcycle as a pillion rider. Therefore, it is case of composite negligence. So, it is choice of the claimants to sue either of the joint tort-feasors since the liability of both tort-feasors is joint and several. In this regard, he relied on the case between Khenyei Vs. New India Assurance Co.Ltd. & Ors. 2015 CJ(SC) 609 , wherein it is specifically held by the Hon'ble Apex Court that, “In case of composite negligence where the liability is joint and several, it is a choice of the claimant to claim damages from the owner, driver 15 M.A.C.P. No.113/2015 [Judgment] and insurer of both the vehicles or any of them. If the claim is made against one of them, entire amount of compensation on account of injury or death can be imposed against the owner, driver and insurer of that vehicle, as their liability is joint and several and the claimant can recover the amount from any of them.” 26.In the light of above prepositions laid down by The Hon'ble Supreme Court, I find substance in the argument of learned Advocate for the claimant that, in this case, the claimant can claim compensation against driver, owner and insurer of the truck i.e. respondent Nos. 1 to 3. As discussed earlier, the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the truck by respondent No.3, which was owned by respondent No.2 and insured with respondent No.1. Hence, respondent Nos. 1 to 3 are jointly and severally held liable to pay the amount of compensation to the claimants. As discussed earlier, claimant No.2 has his own source of income. Therefore, he will not get amount of compensation equally, as compared to claimant No.1. In the result, I answer Issue Nos.2 and 3 accordingly as mentioned against it and 16 M.A.C.P. No.113/2015 [Judgment] in answer to issue No.4, pass following order :- ORDER The Petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs as under :- 1]Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 jointly and severally do pay Rs.4,62,000/- (Rs. Four Lakh Sixty- two Thousand only) (inclusive of NFL amount) alongwith interest @ 8% per annum from the date of the petition till its realization to the claimants. 2]Out of compensation amount, Rs.4,00,000/- alongwith interest be given to claimant No.1. Out of said amount Rs.2,00,000/- be invested in the Fixed Deposit in her name in any nationalized bank of her choice for the period of three years. She shall be at liberty to withdraw the amount of interest accrued on the fixed deposit amount monthly, if desired. Remaining amount be given to her by account payee cheque in her name on due identification. 3]Out of compensation amount, Rs.62,000/- alongwith interest be given to claimant No.2. by account payee cheque in his name on due identification. 4]Award be drawn accordingly.

J U D G E M E N T (Delivered on 18­03­2020 ) 1]This is a petition under section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act for grant of compensation on account of permanent disablement sustained by the petitioner due to injuries sustained in motor accident occurred on 14­2­2015 at about 7.15 p.m. on village Govindpur Tanda, Darga Road, Lalwadi Shivar, Near Agricultural field of Pralhad Jadhav Tq. Ambad, District Jalna. 2]In short, on 14­2­2015 at about 7.15 p. m. petitioner an Rahul Aawhane were going from Nipanipimpalgaon towards Ambad on Hero Honda Motorcycle bearing No. MH­21­V­8073. Petitioner was drivin g said motorcycle and Rahul was a pillion rider. When they came near Govindpur Tanda, Darga Road, Lalwadi Shivar, Near Agricultural field of Pralhad Jadhav a Swift Desire Car bearing No. MH­21­V­9730 driven by respondent no.1 came in high speed in rash and negligent manner and dashed to the motorcycle. Therefore, petitioner and pillion rider Rahul sustained grievous injuries. After the accident the report came to be lodged at police station Ambad, Dist. Jalna and offence was registered at CR No. 31/2015 under section 279, 338 and 427 of Indian Penal Code. It is contended that the respondent no.2 is the owner of the Swift Desire Car and at the relevant time car was duly insured with the respondent no.3. 3]At the time of accident petitioner is 45 years old and doing agricultural work and earning Rs.10,000/­ per month. In the said accident due to injuries sustained by him he had sustained permanent disablement. On this count petitioner claims compensation of Rs.3.00 lakh with interest @ 18% per annum. 4]Respondent no.1 and 2 have filed their written statement Exh.19 3 MACP No.219/2015. and resisted the application strongly. They have denied the contents of the petition. It is contended that the police authorities without making proper inquiry wrongly registered the crime against the respondent no.1. It is further contended that the Swift Desire Car bearing No. MH­21­V­9730 was never involved but the driver, owner as well as insurance company is made party to it. It is further contended that as the owner, driver and insurance company of the motorcycle no. MH­21­V­8073 is not made a party. Hence petition is bad in law for non­joinder of necessary parties. 5]Respondent no.3 filed the written statement Exh.17 and resisted the petition strongly. Respondent no.3 has denied all the contents raised in the petition. It is contended that the accident took place on 14­2­2015 and FIR was registered on 23­2­2015 and thus, there is delay of nine days in filing the complaint regarding the accident. It is specifically denied the involvement of Swift Desire Vehicle bearing No. MH­21­V­9730. It is further contended that the driver of Honda Motorcycle was responsible for the accident and denied that the driver of Swift Desire in rash and negligent manner gave dash to the motorcycle. 6]On the basis of the pleading my learned predecessor in chair framed issues at Exh.25 which are reproduced as under : ISSUES FINDING 1.Whether the claimant proves, that he is injured in the motor vehicular accident dated 14­02­2015 ? Yes 2.Whether the claimant proves, that he is injured in the accident due to rash and negligent driving of Swift Dezire Car bearing No. MH­21­V­9730, which is owned by respondent no.2 ? Yes 4 MACP No.219/2015. 3.What is just and reasonable amount of compensation and against whom it is to be awarded ? Rs.1,80,000/­ By respondent no. 2 & 3 jointly and severally. 4.What order and Award ? REASONING AS TO ISSUE NO.1 TO 3 7]Heard learned Advocate Shri Gore for the petitioner, learned Advocate Shri Phatke for respondent no.1 and 2 and learned Advocate Shri Patankar for respondent no.3. 8]To prove the claim petitioner Vimalnath Manjaba Masalkar filed his affidavit Exh.26 in lieu of examination­in­chief and offered for cross­ examination on oath. The petitioner has also examined PW2 Datta Gangadhar Londe Exh.40, PW3 Dr. Parmeshwar Jaiswal 44, PW4 Sadashiv Rambhau Shelke Exh.47 and PW5 Kiran Yadgiri Balla Exh.53. Whereas respondent no.1 and 2 have not adduced any oral evidence. However, respondent no.3 insurance company has filed affidavit of Anup Shyamrao Chimkar Exh.80, an administrative officer of the respondent no.3 company to rebut the claim of the petitioner. 9]The learned advocate for the petitioner submitted that the evidence of the petitioner on the point of happening of accident and involvement of the Maruti Swift Desire Car bearing No. MH­21­V­9730 is duly proved. He submitted that it is the respondent no.1 and 2 who have to enter into witness box and to deny about the involvement of the vehicle but they did not enter into the witness box. Hence adverse inference is to be drawn. He further submitted that though the FIR came to be lodged after nine days but in 5 MACP No.219/2015. absence of other material on record conclusion cannot be drawn that the Maruti Swift Desire vehicle is falsely implanted. He submitted evidence of Assistant Manager of respondent no.3 cannot be relied upon as he has not personally verified the police papers. 10]Per contra, the learned advocate for respondent no.3 vehemently submitted that as per the FIR the vehicle involved was Indica Car. He further submitted that even in the MLC report there is a mention of Indica Car. After the accident there was delay of nine days to lodge the report. However, no any explanation is coming forth. He brought attention of this court the statement of respondent no.1 recorded by police wherein respondent no.1 has admitted of commission of offence and involvement of the Swift Desire Car, and submitted that the said statement not bears the signature of respondent no.1 and date on which his statement was recorded. He further submitted that the respondent no.3 has made every attempt to bring before court the investigating officer. However, in spite of service of summons and warrant investigation officer is not made available himself for examination and thus, a conclusion can be drawn that there was collusion between the petitioner and respondent no.1 and 2. 11]Petitioner has testified on oath by way of affidavit in lieu of examination in chief that on 14­2­2015 at about 7.15 p.m. he alongwith Rahul Aavhane were proceeding on motorcycle bearing No. MH­21­V­8073. He was driving the motorcycle and Rahul was pillion rider. It is further testified that when they reached near the field of Pralhad Jadhav in Lalwadi Shivar, Govindpur Tanda, Darga Road, Ambad Dist. Jalna, a Swift Desire Car bearing No. MH­21­V­9730 came in high speed and gave dash to the motorcycle. It is pertinent to note that during the cross­examination by respondent no.1 and 2 it has not been suggested that the vehicle Maruti Desire was not involved in 6 MACP No.219/2015. the accident. Whereas in the cross­examination by respondent no.3 it has been specifically denied by petitioner that the Swift Desire Car was not involved and in collusion with police it was implanted. 12]Anup Chidkas, Assistant Manager of the respondent no.3 company testified that the accident took place on 14­2­2015. However, it was between motorcycle and unregistered Indica Car and due to negligence of petitioner. It is further testified that there is nine days delay in filing report and the petitioner deliberately involved the Desire Car in collusion with the owner, driver and police. 13] Thus, on consideration of the oral evidence of both the parties on tenor of their cross­examination the happening of accident on 14­2­2015 at about 5.30 p.m. on Ambad Govindpur Tanda is not in dispute. What is disputed by respondent no.3 is the involvement of the Maruti Car Desire which is admittedly insured with the respondent no.3 insurance company. Much has been harmed by the learned advocate for a respondent no.3 company for a delay to file the report. 14] Before appreciating the submission of learned advocate for respondent I would like to refer a case of Ravi Vs. Badrinarayan and others; AIR 2011 SCW 1530 wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court has observed that­ “in accident cases, human nature and family responsibilities occupy the mind of kith and kin to such an extent that they give more importance to get the victim treated rather than to rush to the Police Station. Under such circumstances, they are not expected to act mechanically with promptitude in lodging the FIR with the Police. Delay in lodging the FIR thus, cannot be the ground to deny justice to the victim. In cases of delay, the courts are required to examine the evidence with a closer scrutiny and in doing so; the contents of the FIR should also be scrutinized more carefully. If court finds that therer is no 7 MACP No.219/2015. indication of fabrication or it has not been concocted or engineered to implicate innocent persons then, even if there is a delay in lodging the FIR, the claim cannot be dismissed merely on that ground although lodging of FIR is vital in deciding motor accident claim cases. Delay in lodging the claim should not be treated as fatal for such proceedings, if claimant has been able to demonstrate satisfactory and cogent reasons for it. There could be variety of reasons in genuine cases for delayed lodgment of FIR. In such cases, the authenticity of the FIR assumes much more significance than delay in lodging thereof.” 15]Thus, it is manifestly clear that in case delay in lodging FIR cannot be ground to deny the justice to the victim in motor accident. However, the petitioner's evidence has to be examined with the closer scrutiny particularly contents of the FIR. As could be seen that FIR (Exh.29) was registered at police station Ambad on 23­12­2015 for the offence punishable under section 279, 337, 338 and 427 of IPC against unknown indica. Car driver Admittedly the accident occurred on 14­12­2015. The FIR discloses the involvement of the two vehicles one is the motorcycle No. MH­21­V­8073 driven by petitioner and offending vehicle which of Indica car having no registration number mentioned on it. 16] It is pertinent to note that the petitioner has placed on record a statement of respondent no.1 recorded by the investigating officer in which he has specifically stated about involvement of the said desire car and further that the number of the car was not written/pasted on the said vehicle. Even the respondent no.3 has produced a copy of the chargesheet Exh.90 which states that after the completion of the investigation a report under section 173 of Code of the Criminal Procedure came to be filed against respondent no.1 alleging therein that respondent no.1 was driving Indica Car bearing No. MH­ 21­V­9730 in rash and negligent manner on 14­2­2015 on Govindpur Tanda, 8 MACP No.219/2015. Ambad Dist. Jalna. 17] In the present case at hand the information to the police was given by petitioner who also sustained injury in the accident. The delay in registering of FIR however, is not explained in the FIR. Delay may be due to perfunctory act of the police. Moreover, neither respondent no.1 and 2 nor respondent no.3 has sought any explanation during the cross­examination of the petitioner for delay to lodge the report. Delay in lodging the FIR per­se is not always fatal as long as credible explanation for delay. FIR can be used only for the purpose of corroboration or contradiction of the maker only. The petitioner who lodged FIR, having been examined and investigation report is also on record, the case of petitioner can not be disbelieved as motor accident claim is in the nature of civil and he is entitled to prove his case on the basis of evidence adduced. 18] Moreover, from the registration certificate Exh.32 of Desire Car of respondent no.2 it could be further gathered that the said vehicle was registered on 10­12­2014 i.e four days prior to accidant. Therefore, a contention by the respondent no.1 in his statement Exh.35 that the number was not put on the car found to be reliable. Merely because it has been stated by the witnesses in the FIR that it was the Indica Car, they cannot be disbelieved because there is possibility of identification of make of the vehicle. But one fact is very clear that the vehicle which has given dash was not having number on the vehicle. Further respondent no.3 in his written statement at para 5 contended that claimant i.e. petitioner himself was negligent while driving his vehicle and at the same time at para 10 contended that the driver of Maruti Swift Desire was not negligent. Thus, on consideration of the pleading of the respondent no.3, a contrary stand taken by them and it was 9 MACP No.219/2015. not as an alternative plea. 19] Moreover, from the panchanama of the spot of occurrence it could be seen that the said car had sustained severe damage to its bonnet, head light, side glass of right side of the vehicle and tyre tube. The said vehicle was completely new as could be gathered from the registration certificate Exh.32. Therefore, considering these facts it does not appear to be probable that the driver of the vehicle who was not involved in the said accident on his own will come forward to the police station and claim that he has committed the accident and get registered offence against him. Therefore, considering the nature of evidence required in the proceedings under Motorcycle Vehicle Act in my considered opinion the petitioner has succeeded to prove that the Maruti Desire car bearing No. MH­21­V­9730 was involved in the said accident and due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 accident had occurred. 20] The petitioner claim that he has sustained 27% of disability. To prove the disability he has examined PW3 Dr. Parmeshwar Jaiswal. He has also produced discharge sheet Exh.37 from the hospital where he was treated. As per discharge card he was hospitalized from 16­2­2015 to 25­2­2015 and he was operated for nailing and fracture subtrochanteric femur right side with fracture tibia and fibula right side. PW3 Dr. Jaiswal testified that he had clinically examined petitioner and perused his old paper and found sustained fracture subtrochanteric femur right side with fracture tibia and fibula right side. He was operated for nailing and fracture subtrochanteric femur right side with fracture tibia and fibula right side. He further testified that he was limping gait on right lower limbs. He has shortening of right lower limb by 2 ½ cm. He has restrictions of movement right knee, flexion by 20 degree. He has permanent disability 27% by Mc. Bride Scale. According to him petitioner 10 MACP No.219/2015. cannot squat properly or sit cross legged. PW3 Dr. Jaiswal opined that the petitioner has sustained permanent disablement 27% and accordingly issued certificate Exh.45. Admittedly PW3 Dr. Jaiswal has not given treatment to petitioner. Moreover, he had also not taken the X­ray before issuing certificate. The petitioner is agricultural labour. Therefore, considering these facts in my considered opinion for the purpose of loss of earning capacity it is to be taken as 10% only. 21] According to petitioner he is agricultural labour earning Rs.10,000/­ per month. In absence of any document on record it is proper that a notional income of Rs.6500/­ p.m. is to be considered for the purpose of computation of loss of income. The petitioner at the time of accident was 43 years old and therefore, applicable multiplier is “14” as per case of Sarla Varma 2009 (SC) 1378. Thus, considering his monthly income of Rs.6500/­ and multiplier of “14” the petitioner is entitled for Rs.1,09,200/­ towards loss of earning capacity. 22]Further as per the evidence of PW2 Datta Londe he has spent Rs.35,000/­ for the treatment in the hospital and Rs. 25156/­ for the medicines hence he is entitled for Rs.60156/­ . Further considering nature of injuries sustained by him, for the pain and suffering and diet it is proper to grant an additional amount. Therefore, in my considered opinion total amount of Rs.1,80/­ for the compensation would be just compensation. 23]Petitioner has claimed interest @ 18% per annum. However, considering the rate of interest for fixed deposits in the nationalized bank it is proper to grant interest @8% per annum from the date of petition. 24] The respondent no.3 contended that there is a breach of terms and condition of the policy as the petitioner has not intimated of the accident 11 MACP No.219/2015. and thus, committed a breach of condition under section 134 of the Motor Vehicles Act. Section 134 of the Motor Vehicles Act casts a duty on the driver when any person is injured or any driver to provide the medical aid to the person injured and also to give information to the police officer required by him. Further clause (c) of section 134 casts duty upon the driver and owner of the vehicle in case of accident and injury to person to provide information in hand writing to the insurer who has issued the certificate of insurance about occurrence of accident mentioning insurance policy number and period of its validity, date, time and place of accident, particulars of the person injured or killed in the accident, name of the driver and the particulars of his driving license. 25] The learned advocate for the respondent no.3 submitted that even after the notice was sent vide Exh.85 to the respondent no.2 owner of the car he has not furnished the information. It is pertinent to note that after this petition came to be filed the said information was sought by letter dated 23­4­ 2016 i.e. after appearance of respondent no.3 in the petition. But if we consider the provisions of section 134(c) in my humble judgment it is not a fundamental breach to deny the liability for the payment of the compensation. Therefore, on this count respondent no.3 cannot deny its liability to pay the compensation. 26] Admittedly respondent no.2 was owner of the offending vehicle and as the Swift Car No. MH­21­V­9730 was duly insured with the respondent no.3 they are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation. Accordingly I answer issues and proceed to pass following order. O R D E R 1]Petition bearing MACP No. 219/2015 by Vimalnath Manjoba Masalkar is hereby partly allowed. 12 MACP No.219/2015. 2]The respondent no.2 and 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation of Rs. 1,80,000/­ inclusive of no fault liability if any already paid alongwith interest at rate of 8 % from the date of petition i. e. from 19­03­2015 till realization of whole amount. 3]No order as to cost. 4]Award be drawn up accordingly.

J U D G E M E N T (Delivered on 18­03­2020 ) 1]This is a petition under section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act for grant of compensation on account of permanent disablement sustained by the petitioner due to injuries sustained in motor accident occurred on 14­2­2015 at about 7.15 p.m. on village Govindpur Tanda, Darga Road, Lalwadi Shivar, Near Agricultural field of Pralhad Jadhav Tq. Ambad, District Jalna. 2]In short, on 14­2­2015 at about 7.15 p. m. petitioner an Vimalnath Masalkar were going from Nipanipimpalgaon towards Ambad on Hero Honda Motorcycle bearing No. MH­21­V­8073. Vimalnath Masalkar was driving said motorcycle and petutiner was a pillion rider . When they came near Govindpur Tanda, Darga Road, Lalwadi Shivar, Near Agricultural field of Pralhad Jadhav a Swift Desire Car bearing No. MH­21­V­9730 driven by respondent no.1 came in high speed in rash and negligent manner and dashed to the motorcycle. Therefore, petitioner and driver Vimalnath sustained grievous injuries. After the accident the report came to be lodged at police station Ambad, Dist. Jalna and offence was registered at CR No. 31/2015 under section 279, 338 and 427 of Indian Penal Code. It is contended that the respondent no.2 is the owner of the Swift Desire Car and at the relevant time car was duly insured with the respondent no.3. 3]At the time of accident petitioner is 25 years old and doing agricultural work and earning Rs.10,000/­ per month. In the said accident due to injuries sustained by him he had sustained permanent disablement. On this count petitioner claims compensation of Rs.3500 lakh with interest @ 18% per annum. 4]Respondent no.1 and 2 have filed their written statement Exh.18 3 MACP No.220/2015. and resisted the application strongly. They have denied the contents of the petition. It is contended that the police authorities without making proper inquiry wrongly registered the crime against the respondent no.1. It is further contended that the Swift Desire Car bearing No. MH­21­V­9730 was never involved but the driver, owner as well as insurance company is made party to it. It is further contended that as the owner, driver and insurance company of the motorcycle no. MH­21­V­8073 is not made a party. Hence petition is bad in law for non­joinder of necessary parties. 5]Respondent no.3 filed the written statement Exh.16 and resisted the petition strongly. Respondent no.3 has denied all the contents raised in the petition. It is contended that the accident took place on 14­2­2015 and FIR was registered on 23­2­2015 and thus, there is delay of nine days in filing the complaint regarding the accident. It is specifically denied the involvement of Swift Desire Vehicle bearing No. MH­21­V­9730. It is further contended that the driver of Honda Motorcycle was responsible for the accident and denied that the driver of Swift Desire in rash and negligent manner gave dash to the motorcycle. 6]On the basis of the pleading my learned predecessor in chair framed issues at Exh.24 which are reproduced as under : ISSUES FINDING 1.Whether the claimant proves, that he is injured in the motor vehicular accident dated 14­02­2015 ? Yes 2.Whether the claimant proves, that he is injured in the accident due to rash and negligent driving of Swift Dezire Car bearing No. MH­21­V­9730, which is owned by respondent no.2 ? Yes 4 MACP No.220/2015. 3. What is just and reasonable amount of compensation and against whom it is to be awarded ? Rs.2,70,000/­ By respondent no. 2 & 3 jointly and severally. 4.What order and Award ? REASONING AS TO ISSUE NO.1 TO 3 7]Heard learned Advocate Shri Gore for the petitioner, learned Advocate Shri Phatke for respondent no.1 and 2 and learned Advocate Shri Patankar for respondent no.3. 8]To prove the claim petitioner Rahul Baburao Awhane filed his affidavit Exh.25 in lieu of examination­in­chief and offered for cross­ examination on oath. The petitioner has also examined PW2 Datta Gangadhar Londe Exh.41, PW3 Dr. Parmeshwar Jaiswal 53, PW4 Sadashiv Rambhau Shelke Exh.5 and PW5 Kiran Yadgiri Balla Exh.06. Whereas respondent no.1 and 2 have not adduced any oral evidence. However, respondent no.3 insurance company has filed affidavit of Anup Shyamrao Chimkar Exh.96, an administrative officer of the respondent no.3 company to rebut the claim of the petitioner. 9]The learned advocate for the petitioner submitted that the evidence of the petitioner on the point of happening of accident and involvement of the Maruti Swift Desire Car bearing No. MH­21­V­9730 is duly proved. He submitted that it is the respondent no.1 and 2 who have to enter into witness box and to deny about the involvement of the vehicle but they did not enter into the witness box. Hence adverse inference is to be drawn. He further submitted that though the FIR came to be lodged after nine days but in absence of other material on record conclusion cannot be drawn that the 5 MACP No.220/2015. Maruti Swift Desire vehicle is falsely implanted. He submitted evidence of Assistant Manager of respondent no.3 cannot be relied upon as he has not personally verified the police papers. 10]Per contra, the learned advocate for respondent no.3 vehemently submitted that as per the FIR the vehicle involved was Indica Car. He further submitted that even in the MLC report there is a mention of Indica Car. After the accident there was delay of nine days to lodge the report. However, no any explanation is coming forth. He brought attention of this court the statement of respondent no.1 recorded by police wherein respondent no.1 has admitted of commission of offence and involvement of the Swift Desire Car, and submitted that the said statement not bears the signature of respondent no.1 and date on which his statement was recorded. He further submitted that the respondent no.3 has made every attempt to bring before court the investigating officer. However, in spite of service of summons and warrant investigation officer is not made available himself for examination and thus, a conclusion can be drawn that there was collusion between the petitioner and respondent no.1 and 2. 11]Petitioner has testified on oath by way of affidavit in lieu of examination in chief that on 14­2­2015 at about 7.15 p.m. he alongwith Vimalnath were proceeding on motorcycle bearing No. MH­21­V­8073. Vimalnath was driving the motorcycle and he was pillion rider. It is further testified that when they reached near the field of Pralhad Jadhav in Lalwadi Shivar, Govindpur Tanda, Darga Road, Ambad Dist. Jalna, a Swift Desire Car bearing No. MH­21­V­9730 came in high speed and gave dash to the motorcycle. It is pertinent to note that during the cross­examination by respondent no.1 and 2 it has not been suggested that the vehicle Maruti Desire was not involved in the accident. Whereas in the cross­examination by 6 MACP No.220/2015. respondent no.3 it has been specifically denied by petitioner that the Swift Desire Car was not involved and in collusion with police it was implanted. 12]Anup Chidkas, Assistant Manager of the respondent no.3 company testified that the accident took place on 14­2­2015. However, it was between motorcycle and unregistered Indica Car and due to negligence of petitioner. It is further testified that there is nine days delay in filing report and the petitioner deliberately involved the Desire Car in collusion with the owner, driver and police. 13] Thus, on consideration of the oral evidence of both the parties on tenor of their cross­examination the happening of accident on 14­2­2015 at about 5.30 p.m. on Ambad Govindpur Tanda is not in dispute. What is disputed by respondent no.3 is the involvement of the Maruti Car Desire which is admittedly insured with the respondent no.3 insurance company. Much has been harmed by the learned advocate for a respondent no.3 company for a delay to file the report. 14] Before appreciating the submission of learned advocate for respondent I would like to refer a case of Ravi Vs. Badrinarayan and others; AIR 2011 SCW 1530 wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court has observed that­ “in accident cases, human nature and family responsibilities occupy the mind of kith and kin to such an extent that they give more importance to get the victim treated rather than to rush to the Police Station. Under such circumstances, they are not expected to act mechanically with promptitude in lodging the FIR with the Police. Delay in lodging the FIR thus, cannot be the ground to deny justice to the victim. In cases of delay, the courts are required to examine the evidence with a closer scrutiny and in doing so; the contents of the FIR should also be scrutinized more carefully. If court finds that therer is no indication of fabrication or it has not been concocted or engineered to implicate innocent persons then, even if there is a delay in lodging the FIR, the claim cannot be 7 MACP No.220/2015. dismissed merely on that ground although lodging of FIR is vital in deciding motor accident claim cases. Delay in lodging the claim should not be treated as fatal for such proceedings, if claimant has been able to demonstrate satisfactory and cogent reasons for it. There could be variety of reasons in genuine cases for delayed lodgment of FIR. In such cases, the authenticity of the FIR assumes much more significance than delay in lodging thereof.” 15]Thus, it is manifestly clear that in case delay in lodging FIR cannot be ground to deny the justice to the victim in motor accident. However, the petitioner's evidence has to be examined with the closer scrutiny particularly contents of the FIR. As could be seen that FIR (Exh.29) was registered at police station Ambad on 23­12­2015 for the offence punishable under section 279, 337, 338 and 427 of IPC against unknown indica. Car driver Admittedly the accident occurred on 14­12­2015. The FIR discloses the involvement of the two vehicles one is the motorcycle No. MH­21­V­8073 driven by petitioner and offending vehicle which of Indica car having no registration number mentioned on it. 16] It is pertinent to note that the petitioner has placed on record a statement of respondent no.1 recorded by the investigating officer in which he has specifically stated about involvement of the said desire car and further that the number of the car was not written/pasted on the said vehicle. Even the respondent no.3 has produced a copy of the chargesheet Exh.90 which states that after the completion of the investigation a report under section 173 of Code of the Criminal Procedure came to be filed against respondent no.1 alleging therein that respondent no.1 was driving Indica Car bearing No. MH­ 21­V­9730 in rash and negligent manner on 14­2­2015 on Govindpur Tanda, Ambad Dist. Jalna. 17] In the present case at hand the informatio n to the police was 8 MACP No.220/2015. given by driver of motorcycle Vimalnath who also sustained injury in the accident. The delay in registering of FIR howe ver, is not explained in the FIR. Delay may be due to perfunctory act of the police. Moreover, neither respondent no.1 and 2 nor respondent no.3 has sought any explanation during the cross­examination of the petitioner for delay to lodge the report. Delay in lodging the FIR per se is not always fatal as long explanation is credible for delay. FIR can be used only for the purpose or corroboration for contradiction of the maker only. Though maker having been not examined by the petitioner, a reliance can be placed upon FIR and investigation report, and disbelieve and discredit case of the petitioner as motor accident claim is in the nature of civil and he is entitled to prove his case on the basis of evidence adduced. 18] Moreover, from the registration certificate Exh.31 of Desire Car of respondent no.2 it could be further gathered that the said vehicle was registered on 10­12­2014 i.e four days prior to accidant. Therefore, a contention by the respondent no.1 in his statement Exh.34 that the number was not put on the car found to be reliable. Merely because it has been stated by the witnesses in the FIR that it was the Indica Car, they cannot be disbelieved because there is possibility of identification of make of the vehicle. But one fact is very clear that the vehicle which has given dash was not having number on the vehicle. Further respondent no.3 in his written statement at para 5 contended that claimant i.e. petitioner himself was negligent while driving his vehicle and at the same time at para 10 contended that the driver of Maruti Swift Desire was not negligent. Thus, on consideration of the pleading of the respondent no.3, a contrary stand taken by them and it was not as an alternative plea. 9 MACP No.220/2015. 19] Moreover, from the panchanama of the spot of occurrence Exh 29 it could be seen that the said car had sustained severe damage to its bonnet, head light, side glass of right side of the vehicle and tyre tube. The said vehicle was completely new as could be gathered from the registration certificate Exh.31. Therefore, considering these facts it does not appear to be probable that the driver of the vehicle who was not involved in the said accident on his own will come forward to the police station and claim that he has committed the accident and get registered offence against him. Therefore, considering the nature of evidence required in the proceedings under Motorcycle Vehicle Act in my considered opinion the petitioner has succeeded to prove that the Maruti Desire car bearing No. MH­21­V­9730 was involved in the said accident and due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 accident had occurred. 21] The petitioner claim that he has sustained 30% of disability. To prove the disability he has examined PW3 Dr. Parmeshwar Jaiswal. He has also produced discharge sheet Exh.37 from the hospital where he was treated. As per discharge card she was hospitalized from 20­2­2015 to 14­3­2015 and he was operated for internal fixation by plate at acetabulum and nail right tibia. PW3 Dr. Jaiswal testified that he had clinically examined petitioner and perused his old paper and found sustained fracture acetabulum right side with fracture pelvis right side with fracture tibia and fibula right side with haemorrhagic shock. He was operated operated for internal fixation by plate at acetabulum and nail right tibia. He further testified that he has limping gait on right lower limbs. He has shortening of right leg by 1 ½ cm. He has restrictions of movement right hip joint, flexion by 30 degree and right knee 30%. According to him petitioner cannot squat properly or sit cross legged. PW3 Dr. Jaiswal opined that the petitioner has sustained permanent disablement 30% and accordingly issued certificate Exh.54. Admittedly he has 10 MACP No.220/2015. not given treatment to petitioner. Moreover, he had also not taken the X­ray before issuing certificate. The petitioner is agricultural labour. Therefore, considering these facts in my considered opinion for the purpose of loss of earning capacity it is to be taken as the 10% only. 22] According to petitioner he is agricultural labour earning Rs.10,000/­ per month. In absence of any document on record it is proper that a notional income of Rs.6500/­ p.m. is to be considered for the purpose of computation of loss of income. As per leaving certificate Exh.55 date of birth of petitioner is 21­2­1992. Thus petitioner at the time of accident was 23 years old and therefore, applicable multiplier is “18” as per case of Sar la Varma 2009 (SC) 1378. Thus, considering his monthly income of Rs.6500/­, multiplier of “18” and loss of earning capacity of 10% only, the petitioner is entitled for Rs.1,40,400/­ towards loss of earning capacity. 23]Further as per the evidence of PW2 Datta Londe he has spent Rs.84,450/­ for the treatment in the hospital and spent for Rs. 25156/­ for the medicines hence he is entitled for Rs.2,50,006/­. Further considering nature of injuries sustained by him, for the pain and suffering and diet it is proper to grant an additional amount. Therefore, in my considered opinion total amount of Rs.2,70,000/­ for the compensation would be just compensation. 24]Petitioner has claimed interest @ 18% per annum. However, considering the rate of interest for fixed deposits in the nationalized bank it is proper to grant interest @8% per annum from the date of petition. 25] The respondent no.3 contended that there is a breach of terms and condition of the policy as the petitioner has not intimated of the accident and thus, committed a breach of condition under section 134 of the Motor Vehicles Act. Section 134 of the Motor Vehicles Act casts a duty on the driver 11 MACP No.220/2015. when any person is injured or any driver to provide the medical aid to the person injured and also to give information to the police officer required by him. Further clause (c) of section 134 casts duty upon the driver and owner of the vehicle in case of accident and injury to person to provide information in hand writing to the insurer who has issued the certificate of insurance about occurrence of accident mentioning insurance policy number and period of its validity, date, time and place of accident, particulars of the person injured or killed in the accident, name of the driver and the particulars of his driving license. 26] The learned advocate for the respondent no.3 submitted that even after the notice was sent vide Exh.101 to the respondent no.2 owner of the car he has not furnished the information. It is pertinent to note that after this petition came to be filed the said information was sought by letter dated 23­4­2016 i.e. after appearance of respondent no.3 in the petition. But if we consider the provisions of section 134(c) in my humble judgment it is not a fundamental breach to deny the liability for the payment of the compensation. Therefore, on this count respondent no.3 cannot deny its liability to pay the compensation. 27]Admittedly respondent no.2 was owner of the offending vehicle and as the Swift Car No. MH­21­V­9730 was duly insured with the respondent no.3 they are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation. Accordingly I answer issues and proceed to pass following order. O R D E R 1]Petition bearing MACP No. 220/2015 by Rahul Bapurao Aawhane is hereby partly allowed. 2]The respondent no.2 and 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation of Rs. 2,70,000/­ inclusive of no fault liability if any 12 MACP No.220/2015. already paid alongwith interest at rate of 8 % from the date of petition i. e. from 19­03­2015 till realization of whole amount. 3]No order as to cost. 4]Award be drawn up accordingly.

REASONING AS TO ISSUE NO.1 TO 3 7]Heard learned Advocate Shri Gore for the petitioner, learned Advocate Shri Phatke for respondent no.1 and 2 and learned Advocate Shri Patankar for respondent no.3. 8]To prove the claim petitioner Rahul Baburao Awhane filed his affidavit Exh.25 in lieu of examination­in­chief and offered for cross­ examination on oath. The petitioner has also examined PW2 Datta Gangadhar Londe Exh.41, PW3 Dr. Parmeshwar Jaiswal 53, PW4 Sadashiv Rambhau Shelke Exh.5 and PW5 Kiran Yadgiri Balla Exh.06. Whereas respondent no.1 and 2 have not adduced any oral evidence. However, respondent no.3 insurance company has filed affidavit of Anup Shyamrao Chimkar Exh.96, an administrative officer of the respondent no.3 company to rebut the claim of the petitioner. 9]The learned advocate for the petitioner submitted that the evidence of the petitioner on the point of happening of accident and involvement of the Maruti Swift Desire Car bearing No. MH­21­V­9730 is duly proved. He submitted that it is the respondent no.1 and 2 who have to enter into witness box and to deny about the involvement of the vehicle but they did not enter into the witness box. Hence adverse inference is to be drawn. He further submitted that though the FIR came to be lodged after nine days but in absence of other material on record conclusion cannot be drawn that the 5 MACP No.220/2015. Maruti Swift Desire vehicle is falsely implanted. He submitted evidence of Assistant Manager of respondent no.3 cannot be relied upon as he has not personally verified the police papers. 10]Per contra, the learned advocate for respondent no.3 vehemently submitted that as per the FIR the vehicle involved was Indica Car. He further submitted that even in the MLC report there is a mention of Indica Car. After the accident there was delay of nine days to lodge the report. However, no any explanation is coming forth. He brought attention of this court the statement of respondent no.1 recorded by police wherein respondent no.1 has admitted of commission of offence and involvement of the Swift Desire Car, and submitted that the said statement not bears the signature of respondent no.1 and date on which his statement was recorded. He further submitted that the respondent no.3 has made every attempt to bring before court the investigating officer. However, in spite of service of summons and warrant investigation officer is not made available himself for examination and thus, a conclusion can be drawn that there was collusion between the petitioner and respondent no.1 and 2. 11]Petitioner has testified on oath by way of affidavit in lieu of examination in chief that on 14­2­2015 at about 7.15 p.m. he alongwith Vimalnath were proceeding on motorcycle bearing No. MH­21­V­8073. Vimalnath was driving the motorcycle and he was pillion rider. It is further testified that when they reached near the field of Pralhad Jadhav in Lalwadi Shivar, Govindpur Tanda, Darga Road, Ambad Dist. Jalna, a Swift Desire Car bearing No. MH­21­V­9730 came in high speed and gave dash to the motorcycle. It is pertinent to note that during the cross­examination by respondent no.1 and 2 it has not been suggested that the vehicle Maruti Desire was not involved in the accident. Whereas in the cross­examination by 6 MACP No.220/2015. respondent no.3 it has been specifically denied by petitioner that the Swift Desire Car was not involved and in collusion with police it was implanted. 12]Anup Chidkas, Assistant Manager of the respondent no.3 company testified that the accident took place on 14­2­2015. However, it was between motorcycle and unregistered Indica Car and due to negligence of petitioner. It is further testified that there is nine days delay in filing report and the petitioner deliberately involved the Desire Car in collusion with the owner, driver and police. 13] Thus, on consideration of the oral evidence of both the parties on tenor of their cross­examination the happening of accident on 14­2­2015 at about 5.30 p.m. on Ambad Govindpur Tanda is not in dispute. What is disputed by respondent no.3 is the involvement of the Maruti Car Desire which is admittedly insured with the respondent no.3 insurance company. Much has been harmed by the learned advocate for a respondent no.3 company for a delay to file the report. 14] Before appreciating the submission of learned advocate for respondent I would like to refer a case of Ravi Vs. Badrinarayan and others; AIR 2011 SCW 1530 wherein the Hon'ble Apex Court has observed that­ “in accident cases, human nature and family responsibilities occupy the mind of kith and kin to such an extent that they give more importance to get the victim treated rather than to rush to the Police Station. Under such circumstances, they are not expected to act mechanically with promptitude in lodging the FIR with the Police. Delay in lodging the FIR thus, cannot be the ground to deny justice to the victim. In cases of delay, the courts are required to examine the evidence with a closer scrutiny and in doing so; the contents of the FIR should also be scrutinized more carefully. If court finds that therer is no indication of fabrication or it has not been concocted or engineered to implicate innocent persons then, even if there is a delay in lodging the FIR, the claim cannot be 7 MACP No.220/2015. dismissed merely on that ground although lodging of FIR is vital in deciding motor accident claim cases. Delay in lodging the claim should not be treated as fatal for such proceedings, if claimant has been able to demonstrate satisfactory and cogent reasons for it. There could be variety of reasons in genuine cases for delayed lodgment of FIR. In such cases, the authenticity of the FIR assumes much more significance than delay in lodging thereof.” 15]Thus, it is manifestly clear that in case delay in lodging FIR cannot be ground to deny the justice to the victim in motor accident. However, the petitioner's evidence has to be examined with the closer scrutiny particularly contents of the FIR. As could be seen that FIR (Exh.29) was registered at police station Ambad on 23­12­2015 for the offence punishable under section 279, 337, 338 and 427 of IPC against unknown indica. Car driver Admittedly the accident occurred on 14­12­2015. The FIR discloses the involvement of the two vehicles one is the motorcycle No. MH­21­V­8073 driven by petitioner and offending vehicle which of Indica car having no registration number mentioned on it. 16] It is pertinent to note that the petitioner has placed on record a statement of respondent no.1 recorded by the investigating officer in which he has specifically stated about involvement of the said desire car and further that the number of the car was not written/pasted on the said vehicle. Even the respondent no.3 has produced a copy of the chargesheet Exh.90 which states that after the completion of the investigation a report under section 173 of Code of the Criminal Procedure came to be filed against respondent no.1 alleging therein that respondent no.1 was driving Indica Car bearing No. MH­ 21­V­9730 in rash and negligent manner on 14­2­2015 on Govindpur Tanda, Ambad Dist. Jalna. 17] In the present case at hand the informatio n to the police was 8 MACP No.220/2015. given by driver of motorcycle Vimalnath who also sustained injury in the accident. The delay in registering of FIR howe ver, is not explained in the FIR. Delay may be due to perfunctory act of the police. Moreover, neither respondent no.1 and 2 nor respondent no.3 has sought any explanation during the cross­examination of the petitioner for delay to lodge the report. Delay in lodging the FIR per se is not always fatal as long explanation is credible for delay. FIR can be used only for the purpose or corroboration for contradiction of the maker only. Though maker having been not examined by the petitioner, a reliance can be placed upon FIR and investigation report, and disbelieve and discredit case of the petitioner as motor accident claim is in the nature of civil and he is entitled to prove his case on the basis of evidence adduced. 18] Moreover, from the registration certificate Exh.31 of Desire Car of respondent no.2 it could be further gathered that the said vehicle was registered on 10­12­2014 i.e four days prior to accidant. Therefore, a contention by the respondent no.1 in his statement Exh.34 that the number was not put on the car found to be reliable. Merely because it has been stated by the witnesses in the FIR that it was the Indica Car, they cannot be disbelieved because there is possibility of identification of make of the vehicle. But one fact is very clear that the vehicle which has given dash was not having number on the vehicle. Further respondent no.3 in his written statement at para 5 contended that claimant i.e. petitioner himself was negligent while driving his vehicle and at the same time at para 10 contended that the driver of Maruti Swift Desire was not negligent. Thus, on consideration of the pleading of the respondent no.3, a contrary stand taken by them and it was not as an alternative plea. 9 MACP No.220/2015. 19] Moreover, from the panchanama of the spot of occurrence Exh 29 it could be seen that the said car had sustained severe damage to its bonnet, head light, side glass of right side of the vehicle and tyre tube. The said vehicle was completely new as could be gathered from the registration certificate Exh.31. Therefore, considering these facts it does not appear to be probable that the driver of the vehicle who was not involved in the said accident on his own will come forward to the police station and claim that he has committed the accident and get registered offence against him. Therefore, considering the nature of evidence required in the proceedings under Motorcycle Vehicle Act in my considered opinion the petitioner has succeeded to prove that the Maruti Desire car bearing No. MH­21­V­9730 was involved in the said accident and due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1 accident had occurred. 21] The petitioner claim that he has sustained 30% of disability. To prove the disability he has examined PW3 Dr. Parmeshwar Jaiswal. He has also produced discharge sheet Exh.37 from the hospital where he was treated. As per discharge card she was hospitalized from 20­2­2015 to 14­3­2015 and he was operated for internal fixation by plate at acetabulum and nail right tibia. PW3 Dr. Jaiswal testified that he had clinically examined petitioner and perused his old paper and found sustained fracture acetabulum right side with fracture pelvis right side with fracture tibia and fibula right side with haemorrhagic shock. He was operated operated for internal fixation by plate at acetabulum and nail right tibia. He further testified that he has limping gait on right lower limbs. He has shortening of right leg by 1 ½ cm. He has restrictions of movement right hip joint, flexion by 30 degree and right knee 30%. According to him petitioner cannot squat properly or sit cross legged. PW3 Dr. Jaiswal opined that the petitioner has sustained permanent disablement 30% and accordingly issued certificate Exh.54. Admittedly he has 10 MACP No.220/2015. not given treatment to petitioner. Moreover, he had also not taken the X­ray before issuing certificate. The petitioner is agricultural labour. Therefore, considering these facts in my considered opinion for the purpose of loss of earning capacity it is to be taken as the 10% only. 22] According to petitioner he is agricultural labour earning Rs.10,000/­ per month. In absence of any document on record it is proper that a notional income of Rs.6500/­ p.m. is to be considered for the purpose of computation of loss of income. As per leaving certificate Exh.55 date of birth of petitioner is 21­2­1992. Thus petitioner at the time of accident was 23 years old and therefore, applicable multiplier is “18” as per case of Sar la Varma 2009 (SC) 1378. Thus, considering his monthly income of Rs.6500/­, multiplier of “18” and loss of earning capacity of 10% only, the petitioner is entitled for Rs.1,40,400/­ towards loss of earning capacity. 23]Further as per the evidence of PW2 Datta Londe he has spent Rs.84,450/­ for the treatment in the hospital and spent for Rs. 25156/­ for the medicines hence he is entitled for Rs.2,50,006/­. Further considering nature of injuries sustained by him, for the pain and suffering and diet it is proper to grant an additional amount. Therefore, in my considered opinion total amount of Rs.2,70,000/­ for the compensation would be just compensation. 24]Petitioner has claimed interest @ 18% per annum. However, considering the rate of interest for fixed deposits in the nationalized bank it is proper to grant interest @8% per annum from the date of petition. 25] The respondent no.3 contended that there is a breach of terms and condition of the policy as the petitioner has not intimated of the accident and thus, committed a breach of condition under section 134 of the Motor Vehicles Act. Section 134 of the Motor Vehicles Act casts a duty on the driver 11 MACP No.220/2015. when any person is injured or any driver to provide the medical aid to the person injured and also to give information to the police officer required by him. Further clause (c) of section 134 casts duty upon the driver and owner of the vehicle in case of accident and injury to person to provide information in hand writing to the insurer who has issued the certificate of insurance about occurrence of accident mentioning insurance policy number and period of its validity, date, time and place of accident, particulars of the person injured or killed in the accident, name of the driver and the particulars of his driving license. 26] The learned advocate for the respondent no.3 submitted that even after the notice was sent vide Exh.101 to the respondent no.2 owner of the car he has not furnished the information. It is pertinent to note that after this petition came to be filed the said information was sought by letter dated 23­4­2016 i.e. after appearance of respondent no.3 in the petition. But if we consider the provisions of section 134(c) in my humble judgment it is not a fundamental breach to deny the liability for the payment of the compensation. Therefore, on this count respondent no.3 cannot deny its liability to pay the compensation. 27]Admittedly respondent no.2 was owner of the offending vehicle and as the Swift Car No. MH­21­V­9730 was duly insured with the respondent no.3 they are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation. Accordingly I answer issues and proceed to pass following order. O R D E R 1]Petition bearing MACP No. 220/2015 by Rahul Bapurao Aawhane is hereby partly allowed. 2]The respondent no.2 and 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation of Rs. 2,70,000/­ inclusive of no fault liability if any 12 MACP No.220/2015. already paid alongwith interest at rate of 8 % from the date of petition i. e. from 19­03­2015 till realization of whole amount. 3]No order as to cost. 4]Award be drawn up accordingly.

Ambad, District Jalna. 2]In short, on 14­2­2015 at about 7.15 p. m. petitioner an Vimalnath Masalkar were going from Nipanipimpalgaon towards Ambad on Hero Honda Motorcycle bearing No. MH­21­V­8073. Vimalnath Masalkar was driving said motorcycle and petutiner was a pillion rider . When they came near Govindpur Tanda, Darga Road, Lalwadi Shivar, Near Agricultural field of Pralhad Jadhav a Swift Desire Car bearing No. MH­21­V­9730 driven by respondent no.1 came in high speed in rash and negligent manner and dashed to the motorcycle. Therefore, petitioner and driver Vimalnath sustained grievous injuries. After the accident the report came to be lodged at police station Ambad, Dist. Jalna and offence was registered at CR No. 31/2015 under section 279, 338 and 427 of Indian Penal Code.

They have denied the contents of the petition. It is contended that the police authorities without making proper inquiry wrongly registered the crime against the respondent no.1. It is further contended that the Swift Desire Car bearing No. MH­21­V­9730 was never involved but the driver, owner as well as insurance company is made party to it. It is further contended that as the owner, driver and insurance company of the motorcycle no. MH­21­V­8073 is not made a party. Hence petition is bad in law for non­joinder of necessary parties. 5]Respondent no.3 filed the written statement Exh.16 and resisted the petition strongly. Respondent no.3 has denied all the contents raised in the petition. It is contended that the accident took place on 14­2­2015 and FIR was registered on 23­2­2015 and thus, there is delay of nine days in filing the complaint regarding the accident.

Thus petitioner at the time of accident was 23 years old and therefore, applicable multiplier is “18” as per case of Sar la Varma 2009 (SC) 1378. Thus, considering his monthly income of Rs.6500/­, multiplier of “18” and loss of earning capacity of 10% only, the petitioner is entitled for Rs.1,40,400/­ towards loss of earning capacity. 23]Further as per the evidence of PW2 Datta Londe he has spent Rs.84,450/­ for the treatment in the hospital and spent for Rs. 25156/­ for the medicines hence he is entitled for Rs.2,50,006/­. Further considering nature of injuries sustained by him, for the pain and suffering and diet it is proper to grant an additional amount. Therefore, in my considered opinion total amount of Rs.2,70,000/­ for the compensation would be just compensation. 24]Petitioner has claimed interest @ 18% per annum. However, considering the rate of interest for fixed deposits in the nationalized bank it is proper to grant interest @8% per annum from the date of petition. 25] The respondent no.3 contended that there is a breach of terms and condition of the policy as the petitioner has not intimated of the accident and thus, committed a breach of condition under section 134 of the Motor Vehicles Act. Section 134 of the Motor Vehicles Act casts a duty on the driver 11 MACP No.220/2015. when any person is injured or any driver to provide the medical aid to the person injured and also to give information to the police officer required by him. Further clause (c) of section 134 casts duty upon the driver and owner of the vehicle in case of accident and injury to person to provide information in hand writing to the insurer who has issued the certificate of insurance about occurrence of accident mentioning insurance policy number and period of its validity, date, time and place of accident, particulars of the person injured or killed in the accident, name of the driver and the particulars of his driving license. 26] The learned advocate for the respondent no.3 submitted that even after the notice was sent vide Exh.101 to the respondent no.2 owner of the car he has not furnished the information. It is pertinent to note that after this petition came to be filed the said information was sought by letter dated 23­4­2016 i.e. after appearance of respondent no.3 in the petition. But if we consider the provisions of section 134(c) in my humble judgment it is not a fundamental breach to deny the liability for the payment of the compensation. Therefore, on this count respondent no.3 cannot deny its liability to pay the compensation. 27]Admittedly respondent no.2 was owner of the offending vehicle and as the Swift Car No. MH­21­V­9730 was duly insured with the respondent no.3 they are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation. Accordingly I answer issues and proceed to pass following order. O R D E R 1]Petition bearing MACP No. 220/2015 by Rahul Bapurao Aawhane is hereby partly allowed. 2]The respondent no.2 and 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation of Rs. 2,70,000/­ inclusive of no fault liability if any 12 MACP No.220/2015. already paid alongwith interest at rate of 8 % from the date of petition i. e. from 19­03­2015 till realization of whole amount. 3]No order as to cost. 4]Award be drawn up accordingly.

RESPONDENTS Claim :­ Under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. _________________________________________________ Mr. Shivaji K. Shirse, Advocate for Claimant. Mr. S.K. Hiwale, Advocate for Respondent Nos.1 and 2. Mr. S. S. Rathi, Advocate for Respondent No.3. __________________________________________________ J U D G M E N T (Delivered on 21st October, 2016) 01.The applicants have filed this application for compensation under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, for vehicular accident death. 02.The brief facts, giving rise to this application, are as under :­ That, on 03.03.2015, the husband of claimant no.1, father of claimant no.2 and son of claimants no.3 namely Sunil Anantprasad Dixit was traveling by a Wagon­R car bearing registration No. MH­20­ CS­4114 from MIDC Waluj towards Aurangabad after completing his duty and said car was driven by one Pramod Shivaji Dethe from the 3 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. correct side of the road in a slow and moderate speed. When said car reached near Golwadi Phata on Pandharpur to Aurangabad road at about 10.45 to 11.00 p.m. at the same time one truck bearing no. MH­ 20­W­7922 came from opposite direction i.e. Aurangabad side towards Pandharpur and the respondent no.1 was driving the said truck in a very high and excessive speed in very rash and negligent manner without following the traffic rules and gave dash to the said car, due to which the accident took place. In said accident, Sunil Anantprasad Dixit, Hitesh Suslade and Pramod Dethe sustained various serious injuries on their parts of body. After accident, immediately the injured persons were shifted to G.M.C.H. Aurangabad, where the medical officer declared all three persons as dead. Then, the postmortem was conducted over the dead bodies of the deceased. Medical Officer opined cause of death of deceased Sunil Anantprasad Dixit “due to shock and hemorrhage, due to blunt trauma to chest and abdomen”. After the occurrence of the accident, Mr. Purshottam Ambhore lodged complaint with Chawani Police Station Aurangabad regarding accident. Then police reached to the spot of accident and inquired in the matter. The police of Chawani Police Station had registered crime no. I­33/2015 against respondent no.1, U/sec. 279, 304­A of I.P.C. Police prepared spot panchanama, inquest panchanama, and obtained postmortem report of deceased. Deceased Sunil Anantprasad Dixit was initially served in MSEB , where he had performed his services for some period and thereafter 4 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. he started his personal business and again joined the services with Sapna Mats at Industrial Area Waluj, Aurangabad and thereafter he joined service with Technocraft Toolings, Works, MIDC Waluj, Aurangabad as a Senior Officer and he was discharging his duties honestly and he used to get net salary of more than Rs. 48,462/­ excluding other benefits i.e. Bonus and other facilities. That, at the same time, he used to do the work of Lecturer in Educational Institute known as AIM Education Institute, Osmanpura, Aurangabad. Deceased used to give lecturers on the subjects of Electrical Engineering and from said part time job of lectuerer, the deceased used to earn net income of more than Rs. 1,50,000/­ per annum. From out of the said income, the deceased used to maintain his family members nicely. All the claimants were fully dependent upon the income of the deceased and their requirements were fulfilled by the deceased from his income. The deceased was hard worker and as such he used to earn Rs. 48,462/­ per month as net salary from service and Rs. 1,00,000/­ per annum from lectures for AIM. Now, there is nobody to look after the family affairs in the family of claimants. His mother is old aged and unable to do any kind of work. Therefore, they have filed this claim for getting compensation of Rs. 1,00,00,000/­ against owner, driver and insurance company of said truck. 03.The respondent Nos. 1 and 2 have filed their Written 5 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. Statement at Exh. No. 15. They inter alia denied all the adverse allegations made against them. They denied that respondent no.1 had driven said truck in high speed and rash in negligent manner. Respondent no.1 was holding valid and effective driving licence. The truck was having valid permit for goods transportation. That truck was insured with respondent no.3 and policy of insurance was valid and effective for date of accident. Therefore, they are not liable to pay compensation entire compensation may be awarded and recovered from respondent no.3. 04.Respondent no.3 filed its written statement at Exh. 14. It has denied said accident happened due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. The car driver was driving the car in rash and negligent manner, hence accident was happened. Therefore, this claim is not tenable. Therefore, this petition may be dismissed against it. 05.In the light of these facts, my learned predecessor has framed following issues and I recorded my findings against them for the reasons stated below : POINTS FINDINGS 1.Whether petitioner proves that the deceased died in the motor vehicular accident dated 03/03/2015 ? In the affirmative. 6 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. 2.Whether the petitioners prove that the deceased died in the accident due to rash and negligent driving of Truck bearing No. MH­20­W­7922 which is owned by respondent no.2 and insured with respondent no.3?In the affirmative. 3.What is just and reasonable amount of compensation and against whom it is to be awarded? Yes, As per final order. 4.What Award ? As per final order. REASONS As to Point Nos. 1 to 4 : 06.The claimant no.1 Mira Sunil Dixit has filed her affidavit in lieu of evidence at Exh. No. 23. So also, she has examined C.W.2 Santosh Ramchandra Narwade, Accounts Manager of Technocraft Tollings MIDC Waluj, Aurangabad and closed their evidence. The claimant No.1 in her affidavit, has reiterated the same allegations which are made in their application. In cross­examination she admitted that she personally did not see the accident. She does not know how it was happened. 07.The copies of and F.I.R., spot panchanama and chargesheet are filed at Exhs. 26 to 28. In this case, one Purushottam Ambhore workman of Marathawada Auto Components Pvt. Ltd., lodged report about that accident. He was also not present at the time of accident. 7 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. He received phone calls from his superviser giving information about this accident and he was asked to go to spot and see what happened. Hence, he went there and shifted injured to the hospital and lodged the report. Claimant no.1 Mira in cross­examination admitted that Mr. Purushottam Ambhore was acquainted with her husband and he was working at same place where her husband was working. Mere for that reason that report lodged by him can not be disbelieved. 08.The spot of accident is situated on Pandharpur to Aurangabad road near Golwadi phata. The said road runs in West­East directions. Towards West there is MIDC Waluj, towards East there is Aurangabad. The said road is divided into two lanes/parts. At the middle of it there is broken white line to indicate the center of the road. The accident was happened near that line. At the time of accident, the deceased was proceeding towards Aurangabad from MIDC Waluj in the said car. Therefore, left side portion of that road i.e. northern side lane was its proper lane/side. The said truck was proceeding towards Pandharpur from Aurangabad. Southern side lane of the road was its proper lane/side. At the spot of accident tyre marks of said truck were noticed by panch witnesses. Those marks were coming from the Aurangabad side towards accident spot, indicating from where that truck was passed. In punchnama length of those marks were not shown but in rough map it was shown from substantial distance, in curvature those marks were there. A skid mark 8 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. is left when the driver applies the brake hard. It shows that truck was in high speed and driver of truck made efforts to stop it to avoid impact with car but he could not control it. 09. As per traffic rules broken white line on the road permits the driver to change the lane if it is safe to do so. The facts prevailing at the spot of accident were showing that truck driver left his proper lane and went to wrong side/lane when it was not safe to do so. Instead of proceeding from southern side, i.e. from its proper lane/side of the road, its driver has negligently crossed the center lane and went to wrong side/lane in high speed and gave dash to the car proceeding from its proper lane. The impact was so severe that the car was dragged to some distance and pressed under the truck. It shows intensity of impact. Therefore injured were stranded in the car. Lastly, the car was required to cut down with cutter and injured were taken out. The sketch of spot of accident drawn on page no.4 of spot panchanama shows that said accident happened near the center line of the road. When two vehicles coming from opposite directions collide , the position of the vehicles, directions etc. depends on number of factors like speed of vehicles, intensity of collision, reason for collision, place at which one vehicle hits the other, etc. Therefore merely because there was head on collision between vehicles an inference can not be drawn that drivers of both the vehicles are negligent. Had, the driver of car negligent in driving and responsible 9 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. for the accident police would have filed report against him. 10.Copy of chargesheet filed at Exh. 28 shows that after making due investigation, in respect of that accident only respondent no.1 was prosecuted Under Section 279, 304­A of Indian Penal Code read with section 134 of Motor Vehicle Act,for his rash and negligent driving and causing the death of deceased. The respondents did not examine the driver of said truck i.e. respondent no.1 to prove how that accident was happened due to negligence of car driver as alleged by them. Therefore, I hold that they failed to prove their defence. The claimants are succeeded in proving that said accident happened due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. 11.P.W.2 Santosh Ramchandra Narwade is Accounts Manager of Technocraft Tollings MIDC Waluj, Aurangabad. He deposed that deceased was working as Senior Officer Grade II (Materials) from 2002. He was permanent employee. His nature of duties were to do material purchasing etc. His mothly salary including annual benefits was of Rs. 48,462/­. In September 2014 the salary was revised w.e.f. April 2014. The salary revision letter dtd. 01.09.2014 to March 2015 are got proved from him and they are at Exh. 38/1. His salary slips for the month of December 2014to March 2015 are got proved from him those are at exh. 39 to 42. From his salary, P.F., P.T., and income tax was compulsorily deducted. He was issued to Form No.16 for the year 10 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. 2012­13 to 2014­15 they are Exh. 43 to Exh. 45. He claims that in their company salary used to increase 15% to 20% every year. If deceased would have survived he would have promoted up to post of Senior Manager (H.R.) His appointment letter, and revision in salary letter got proved from this witness. He admitted that no authority letter was issued to him by his superior to depose on behalf of the company. He claims that witness summons was issued in the name of Accounts Manager, therefore he came for deposition. 12.In cross­examination, he admitted that there was no salary slip showing that monthly salary was of Rs. 48,462/­. He admitted that in December 2014 gross salary of Rs. 38,438/­, in January and February 2015 the figure of gross salary was different and in March 2015 gross salary was of Rs. 3907/­. He denied the suggestion that the deceased was not permanent employee and he was getting performance based salary .In their factory age of retirement is 58 years. 13.P.W.3 Yogesh Kulkarni, Director Aim education Institute deposed that from the year 2009 deceased used to taught subject of Electrical Engineering to Degree and Diploma students He was also taken lectures of personality development. He used to pay remuneration of Rs. 5,000 per month.In view of his performance his remuneration was increased upto Rs. 12,500 from last one year. The 11 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. salary certificate issued on 5.4.2015 under his signature is filed at Exh. 49. He had produced certified copies of Income tax returns of his institute from the 2009 to 2013 those are collectively marked as article 'A”In cross examination he admitted that documents filed on record do not disclose that he is partner of Aim's Education Institute. His Institute did not issue any appointment letter to the deceased. Deceased was working as part time lecturer and he was paid remuneration on the basis of number of lectures taken by him. He claims that 7­8 employees are working in their institute and he had shown amount spent on their salary in his income tax returns. Deceased was paid salary by cash but salary voucher was not got executed from him. They even did not maintain record of his attendance and number of lectures taken by him. He admitted that except his bare words he has no evidence to show that deceased was working in their institute and getting salary of Rs. 12,500 /­. 14.On the copy of shop act licence of said institute there is no whisper that said institute is taking coaching classes of personality development, and degree and diploma of electrical engineering. That document proves that said institute is basically giving computer education to the students. Which falsifies his claim. This witness on one hand claims that to the part time lecturer they used to pay remuneration on per lecture basis. Then in that event there cannot be a fixed remuneration of the deceased. Secondly without maintaining 12 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. record about his attendance and number of lectures taken by him, it is impossible to calculate his exact amount of remuneration. In examination in chief he had stated that fixed salary was paid to deceased. In view of his said contradictory versions, without any corroborative evidence, I hold that his evidence is not believable. Hence I do not believe this part of evidence of claimants. 15.Certified copy of Inquest panchanama is filed at Exh. 28 and P.M. Report at Exh. 29. In both these documents, the age of the deceased is shown as 56years. In S.S.C. certificate filed at Exh. 32and copy of Diploma certificate of deceased proves his educational qualification but his date of birth is not writtn on them. Therefore I hold that at the time of death deceased was 56 years old. 16.Learned counsel for the respondent no.3 placed reliance on the case of Jiju Kuruvila and Ors., Vs. Kunjujamma Mohan and Ors., reported in, AIR 2013 SC 2293. In that case, it was held that mere position of vehicles after accident, as shown in the spot panchanama cannot give a substantial proof as to rash and negligent driving on the part of one or other. 17.Learned advocate for the claimants placed reliance on following case laws : 1.Shashikala & Ors., Vs. Gangalakshmamma and Anr., 13 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. Criminal Appeal No. 2836 of 2015, decided on 13th March, 2015. In that case, transport businessman of 45 years lost his life. Tribunal has awarded compensation of Rs.7,50,000/­, after applying multiplier of 13. Hon'ble High Court has enhanced amount of compensation up to Rs.14,69,372/­, after applying multiplier of 14. Hon'ble Apex Court applied multiplier of 17 and enhanced the amount of compensation for loss of future prospect of deceased. 2.Smt. Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, reported in 2009 (2) TAC 677 (SC). In that case, Hon'ble Supreme Court laid down three steps, which Tribunal should follow for determining amount of compensation to have uniformity and consistency first to ascertainment of multiplicand, 2. Ascertainment of multiplier and 3. actual calculation. In that case, in para no. 14 Hon'ble Apex Court laid down how much amount to be deducted towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. Advocate for claimant claims that 1/5th amount may be deducted towards personal and living expenses of deceased. 3.Santosh Devi Vs. national Insurance Company Ltd., and Ors., reported in, 2012 (6) LJSOFT (SC) 183. 4.Rajesh and Ors., Vs. Rajbir Singh and Ors., reported in, 2013 (3) TAC 697 (SC). In both these cases, Hon'ble Apex Court held that in case of self employed persons or persons with fixed wages the actual income of deceased must be enhanced for the purpose of compensation viz., by particular percentage after taking into account 14 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. the age group in which he falls. 5.Vimal Kanwar & Ors., Vs. Kishore Dan & Ors., reported in, 2013 (6) LJSOFT (SC) 172. In that case, it was held that in calculating the amount of compensation, generally the actual income of deceased less income tax should be the starting point. 6.Sanobanu Nazirbhai Mirza and Ors., Vs. Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service, reported in, 2013 (4) TAC 369 (SC) . In that case, Hon'ble Apex Court awarded compensation more than what was claimed by claimants. It was held that it is statutory duty of Tribunal and Hon'ble High Court to award just and reasonable compensation. 7.Kanhsingh and Anr., Vs. Tukaram and Ors., reported in, 2015 (2) TAC 689 (SC). In that case, 27 years old Manager of HDFC died. He was earning Rs.1,81,860/­ p.a. Tribunal has awarded compensation of Rs.12,10,014/­. Hon'ble High Court enhanced that amount by Rs.2,00,000/­. Hon'ble Supreme Court held that deceased had definite chances of his further promotion and consequent increase in salary, hence, his income was increased by 50% for future prospects and the compensation amount was enhanced up to Rs.24,25,604/­. 8.Radha Krishna and Anr., Vs. Gokul and Ors., reported in, 2013 (4) TAC 737 (SC) . In that case, 19 years old student of degree court of Engineering died. Tribunal has awarded compensation of Rs.1,92,000/­. Hon'ble High Court has enhanced that amount by Rs.8000/­ and made it Rs.2,00,000/­. Hon'ble Supreme Court 15 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. enhanced that amount and awarded a lump sum compensation of Rs.7,00,000/­ to the parents of deceased. 9.Raj Rani and Ors., Vs. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd., and Ors., reported in, 2009 AC 1 (SC). In that case, it was held that allowance other than dearness allowance, if beneficial to the entire family should be taken in to consideration for the purpose of assessment of income of the deceased and computation of compensation. 10.Sunil Sharma & Ors., Vs. Bachitar Singh & Ors., reported in, 2011 ALL SCR 1206. In that case, it was held that deduction made on account of H.R.A., C.C.A., medical allowance, E.P.F. and G.I.S. should not have been made in calculating income of deceased. 18. If average income for last 3 years of deceased is calculated from form no.16 (3,14,607/­ + 2,78,164/­+ 3,28,826/­ =9,21,597/3=3,07,199/­) it comes to Rs.3,07,199/­. At the time of death he was 56 years old. Advocate for claimants in his argument placed reliance on para no.12 of judgment of Shashikala (cited supra) and claimed that deceased was working in a private company and there is no fixed age of superannuation. Therefore, while calculating the amount of compensation, the actual income of deceased required to be enhanced by 15% towards future prospects for the purpose of calculation of compensation. In case of Sarla Varma (cited supra) held that in case of those above 50 years, there shall be no addition towards future prospects. In this case, it has specifically come on 16 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. record through the evidence P.W. 02 Santosh Narwarde that as per policy of the company in which deceased was working, the normal age of retirement is 58 years. Therefore, the ratio laid down in Shashikala's case (cited supra) is not applicable to this case. Hence, there is no question of enhancement of income of deceased for calculation of compensation on account of future prospects. The deceased left behind 3 dependents hence 1/3th amount out of it i.e. Rs.1,02,400/­ is deducted towards his personal income. To his age group Multiplier of 8 is applicable. Therefore towards loss of dependency claimants are entitled to get Rs.2,04,799 X 8 = 16,38,392/­. In addition to that towards non pecuniary compensation they are entitled to get following amounts. For loss of consortium claimant no.1 is entitled to get Rs. 1,00,000/­ and towards loss of love and affection all claimants are entitled to get Rs. 50,000/­ each and Rs. 25000/­ towards Funeral charges. Therefore claimants are entitled to get Rs. 19,13,392/­ including NFL amount. 19. Vehicle information extract of said truck filed at exh.30 proves that said truck was insured with respondent no.3 for the period 13­2­2015 to 12­2­2016. The accident was happened on 3­3­2015 thus at the time of accident the truck was validly and effectively insured with respondent no.3 Therefore in light of this factual and legal position I hold that respondent no.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay Rs. 19,13,392/­ to the claimants. 17 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. ORDER 1) Claim Petition is partly allowed. 2)The respondent Nos. 1 to 3 are directed to jointly and severally pay Rs. 19,13,392/­ towards compensation together with interest @ rate of 9% p.a. from the date of this claim petition till its realization. 3)After deposit of said compensation amount,Rs. 6,04,464/­ each be given to the share of claimant nos.2 &3. Amount of Rs. 7,04,464/­ be given to share of claimant no.1. Out of amount of share of claimant no. 1, to 3 Rs. 2,00,000 each be invested in the fixed deposit scheme of any nationalized bank for the period of 3 years. Rest of the amount after adjusting NFL amount be paid to them by an account payee crossed cheque. 4)Award be drawn accordingly. Dt. 21.10.2016 ( S.S. Gosavi ) Member, MACT, Aurangabad. P.T.O. 18 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. ORDER BELOW JUDGMENT 01.In this case after delivery of judgment on 25.10.2016, claimants have filed application at Exh.55 for correction in the judgment and award. Advocate for insurance company raised objection to that application. After hearing both the parties, I make following correction in the judgment. A.While calculating the income from salary of deceased, this Court has placed reliance on Form No. 16, produced by claimants of deceased Sunil Anantprasad Dixit, issued by his employer Techno­ Craft Toolings, for the year 2012­13 at Exh.43, 2013­14 at Exh.44 and 2014­15 at Exh.45. After making total of income of said years average yearly income of deceased was calculated and on its basis amount of compensation was awarded. However, while taking the figures of amount from the From No.16, due to over sight wrong figure was taken. His income from salary is in the taxable range. Therefore, for calculating his income from salary, actual salary less tax required to be taken in to account. Therefore, correction in the judgment is necessary. Actually, figure of gross salary of Rs. 3,44,029/­ ­ Professional Tax Rs.2500/­ ­ Income Tax Rs. 12,000/­ = Rs.3,29,529/­ + 4,13,848 – Professional Tax Rs.2500/­ ­ Income Tax Rs.10,000/­ = 4,01,348/­ + Rs.4,70,115/­ ­ Professional Tax Rs. 2300/­ ­ Income Tax of Rs.14000/­ = 4,53,815/­ (3,29,529 + 4,01,348/­ + 4,53,815 = 11,84,692/­). Therefore, average annual 19 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. income of deceased for last three years prior to his death comes to Rs.11,84,692/3 = 3,94,897/­.

Hence, there shall be no addition towards future prospect. The deceased left behind three dependents, hence, 1/3rd amount out of it i.e. Rs. 1,31,632/­ (Rs.3,94,897/­ – Rs.1,31,632/­ = Rs.2,63,265/­). To this multiplier of 8 is applicable.

Hiwale, Advocate for Respondent Nos.1 and 2. Mr. S. S. Rathi, Advocate for Respondent No.3. __________________________________________________ J U D G M E N T (Delivered on 21st October, 2016) 01.The applicants have filed this application for compensation under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, for vehicular accident death. 02.The brief facts, giving rise to this application, are as under :­ That, on 03.03.2015, the husband of claimant no.1, father of claimant no.2 and son of claimants no.3 namely Sunil Anantprasad Dixit was traveling by a Wagon­R car bearing registration No. MH­20­ CS­4114 from MIDC Waluj towards Aurangabad after completing his duty and said car was driven by one Pramod Shivaji Dethe from the 3 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. correct side of the road in a slow and moderate speed. When said car reached near Golwadi Phata on Pandharpur to Aurangabad road at about 10.45 to 11.00 p.m. at the same time one truck bearing no. MH­ 20­W­7922 came from opposite direction i.e. Aurangabad side towards Pandharpur and the respondent no.1 was driving the said truck in a very high and excessive speed in very rash and negligent manner without following the traffic rules and gave dash to the said car, due to which the accident took place. In said accident, Sunil Anantprasad Dixit, Hitesh Suslade and Pramod Dethe sustained various serious injuries on their parts of body. After accident, immediately the injured persons were shifted to G.M.C.H. Aurangabad, where the medical officer declared all three persons as dead. Then, the postmortem was conducted over the dead bodies of the deceased. Medical Officer opined cause of death of deceased Sunil Anantprasad Dixit “due to shock and hemorrhage, due to blunt trauma to chest and abdomen”. After the occurrence of the accident, Mr. Purshottam Ambhore lodged complaint with Chawani Police Station Aurangabad regarding accident. Then police reached to the spot of accident and inquired in the matter. The police of Chawani Police Station had registered crime no. I­33/2015 against respondent no.1, U/sec. 279, 304­A of I.P.C. Police prepared spot panchanama, inquest panchanama, and obtained postmortem report of deceased. Deceased Sunil Anantprasad Dixit was initially served in MSEB , where he had performed his services for some period and thereafter 4 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. he started his personal business and again joined the services with Sapna Mats at Industrial Area Waluj, Aurangabad and thereafter he joined service with Technocraft Toolings, Works, MIDC Waluj, Aurangabad as a Senior Officer and he was discharging his duties honestly and he used to get net salary of more than Rs. 48,462/­ excluding other benefits i.e. Bonus and other facilities. That, at the same time, he used to do the work of Lecturer in Educational Institute known as AIM Education Institute, Osmanpura, Aurangabad. Deceased used to give lecturers on the subjects of Electrical Engineering and from said part time job of lectuerer, the deceased used to earn net income of more than Rs. 1,50,000/­ per annum. From out of the said income, the deceased used to maintain his family members nicely. All the claimants were fully dependent upon the income of the deceased and their requirements were fulfilled by the deceased from his income. The deceased was hard worker and as such he used to earn Rs. 48,462/­ per month as net salary from service and Rs. 1,00,000/­ per annum from lectures for AIM. Now, there is nobody to look after the family affairs in the family of claimants. His mother is old aged and unable to do any kind of work. Therefore, they have filed this claim for getting compensation of Rs. 1,00,00,000/­ against owner, driver and insurance company of said truck. 03.The respondent Nos. 1 and 2 have filed their Written 5 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. Statement at Exh. No. 15. They inter alia denied all the adverse allegations made against them. They denied that respondent no.1 had driven said truck in high speed and rash in negligent manner. Respondent no.1 was holding valid and effective driving licence. The truck was having valid permit for goods transportation. That truck was insured with respondent no.3 and policy of insurance was valid and effective for date of accident. Therefore, they are not liable to pay compensation entire compensation may be awarded and recovered from respondent no.3. 04.Respondent no.3 filed its written statement at Exh. 14. It has denied said accident happened due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. The car driver was driving the car in rash and negligent manner, hence accident was happened. Therefore, this claim is not tenable. Therefore, this petition may be dismissed against it. 05.In the light of these facts, my learned predecessor has framed following issues and I recorded my findings against them for the reasons stated below : POINTS FINDINGS 1.Whether petitioner proves that the deceased died in the motor vehicular accident dated 03/03/2015 ? In the affirmative. 6 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. 2.Whether the petitioners prove that the deceased died in the accident due to rash and negligent driving of Truck bearing No. MH­20­W­7922 which is owned by respondent no.2 and insured with respondent no.3?In the affirmative. 3.What is just and reasonable amount of compensation and against whom it is to be awarded? Yes, As per final order. 4.What Award ? As per final order. REASONS As to Point Nos. 1 to 4 : 06.The claimant no.1 Mira Sunil Dixit has filed her affidavit in lieu of evidence at Exh. No. 23. So also, she has examined C.W.2 Santosh Ramchandra Narwade, Accounts Manager of Technocraft Tollings MIDC Waluj, Aurangabad and closed their evidence. The claimant No.1 in her affidavit, has reiterated the same allegations which are made in their application. In cross­examination she admitted that she personally did not see the accident. She does not know how it was happened. 07.The copies of and F.I.R., spot panchanama and chargesheet are filed at Exhs. 26 to 28. In this case, one Purushottam Ambhore workman of Marathawada Auto Components Pvt. Ltd., lodged report about that accident. He was also not present at the time of accident. 7 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. He received phone calls from his superviser giving information about this accident and he was asked to go to spot and see what happened. Hence, he went there and shifted injured to the hospital and lodged the report. Claimant no.1 Mira in cross­examination admitted that Mr. Purushottam Ambhore was acquainted with her husband and he was working at same place where her husband was working. Mere for that reason that report lodged by him can not be disbelieved. 08.The spot of accident is situated on Pandharpur to Aurangabad road near Golwadi phata. The said road runs in West­East directions. Towards West there is MIDC Waluj, towards East there is Aurangabad. The said road is divided into two lanes/parts. At the middle of it there is broken white line to indicate the center of the road. The accident was happened near that line. At the time of accident, the deceased was proceeding towards Aurangabad from MIDC Waluj in the said car. Therefore, left side portion of that road i.e. northern side lane was its proper lane/side. The said truck was proceeding towards Pandharpur from Aurangabad. Southern side lane of the road was its proper lane/side. At the spot of accident tyre marks of said truck were noticed by panch witnesses. Those marks were coming from the Aurangabad side towards accident spot, indicating from where that truck was passed. In punchnama length of those marks were not shown but in rough map it was shown from substantial distance, in curvature those marks were there. A skid mark 8 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. is left when the driver applies the brake hard. It shows that truck was in high speed and driver of truck made efforts to stop it to avoid impact with car but he could not control it. 09. As per traffic rules broken white line on the road permits the driver to change the lane if it is safe to do so. The facts prevailing at the spot of accident were showing that truck driver left his proper lane and went to wrong side/lane when it was not safe to do so. Instead of proceeding from southern side, i.e. from its proper lane/side of the road, its driver has negligently crossed the center lane and went to wrong side/lane in high speed and gave dash to the car proceeding from its proper lane. The impact was so severe that the car was dragged to some distance and pressed under the truck. It shows intensity of impact. Therefore injured were stranded in the car. Lastly, the car was required to cut down with cutter and injured were taken out. The sketch of spot of accident drawn on page no.4 of spot panchanama shows that said accident happened near the center line of the road. When two vehicles coming from opposite directions collide , the position of the vehicles, directions etc. depends on number of factors like speed of vehicles, intensity of collision, reason for collision, place at which one vehicle hits the other, etc. Therefore merely because there was head on collision between vehicles an inference can not be drawn that drivers of both the vehicles are negligent. Had, the driver of car negligent in driving and responsible 9 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. for the accident police would have filed report against him. 10.Copy of chargesheet filed at Exh. 28 shows that after making due investigation, in respect of that accident only respondent no.1 was prosecuted Under Section 279, 304­A of Indian Penal Code read with section 134 of Motor Vehicle Act,for his rash and negligent driving and causing the death of deceased. The respondents did not examine the driver of said truck i.e. respondent no.1 to prove how that accident was happened due to negligence of car driver as alleged by them. Therefore, I hold that they failed to prove their defence. The claimants are succeeded in proving that said accident happened due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1. 11.P.W.2 Santosh Ramchandra Narwade is Accounts Manager of Technocraft Tollings MIDC Waluj, Aurangabad. He deposed that deceased was working as Senior Officer Grade II (Materials) from 2002. He was permanent employee. His nature of duties were to do material purchasing etc. His mothly salary including annual benefits was of Rs. 48,462/­. In September 2014 the salary was revised w.e.f. April 2014. The salary revision letter dtd. 01.09.2014 to March 2015 are got proved from him and they are at Exh. 38/1. His salary slips for the month of December 2014to March 2015 are got proved from him those are at exh. 39 to 42. From his salary, P.F., P.T., and income tax was compulsorily deducted. He was issued to Form No.16 for the year 10 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. 2012­13 to 2014­15 they are Exh. 43 to Exh. 45. He claims that in their company salary used to increase 15% to 20% every year. If deceased would have survived he would have promoted up to post of Senior Manager (H.R.) His appointment letter, and revision in salary letter got proved from this witness. He admitted that no authority letter was issued to him by his superior to depose on behalf of the company. He claims that witness summons was issued in the name of Accounts Manager, therefore he came for deposition. 12.In cross­examination, he admitted that there was no salary slip showing that monthly salary was of Rs. 48,462/­. He admitted that in December 2014 gross salary of Rs. 38,438/­, in January and February 2015 the figure of gross salary was different and in March 2015 gross salary was of Rs. 3907/­. He denied the suggestion that the deceased was not permanent employee and he was getting performance based salary .In their factory age of retirement is 58 years. 13.P.W.3 Yogesh Kulkarni, Director Aim education Institute deposed that from the year 2009 deceased used to taught subject of Electrical Engineering to Degree and Diploma students He was also taken lectures of personality development. He used to pay remuneration of Rs. 5,000 per month.In view of his performance his remuneration was increased upto Rs. 12,500 from last one year. The 11 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. salary certificate issued on 5.4.2015 under his signature is filed at Exh. 49. He had produced certified copies of Income tax returns of his institute from the 2009 to 2013 those are collectively marked as article 'A”In cross examination he admitted that documents filed on record do not disclose that he is partner of Aim's Education Institute. His Institute did not issue any appointment letter to the deceased. Deceased was working as part time lecturer and he was paid remuneration on the basis of number of lectures taken by him. He claims that 7­8 employees are working in their institute and he had shown amount spent on their salary in his income tax returns. Deceased was paid salary by cash but salary voucher was not got executed from him. They even did not maintain record of his attendance and number of lectures taken by him. He admitted that except his bare words he has no evidence to show that deceased was working in their institute and getting salary of Rs. 12,500 /­. 14.On the copy of shop act licence of said institute there is no whisper that said institute is taking coaching classes of personality development, and degree and diploma of electrical engineering. That document proves that said institute is basically giving computer education to the students. Which falsifies his claim. This witness on one hand claims that to the part time lecturer they used to pay remuneration on per lecture basis. Then in that event there cannot be a fixed remuneration of the deceased. Secondly without maintaining 12 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. record about his attendance and number of lectures taken by him, it is impossible to calculate his exact amount of remuneration. In examination in chief he had stated that fixed salary was paid to deceased. In view of his said contradictory versions, without any corroborative evidence, I hold that his evidence is not believable. Hence I do not believe this part of evidence of claimants. 15.Certified copy of Inquest panchanama is filed at Exh. 28 and P.M. Report at Exh. 29. In both these documents, the age of the deceased is shown as 56years. In S.S.C. certificate filed at Exh. 32and copy of Diploma certificate of deceased proves his educational qualification but his date of birth is not writtn on them. Therefore I hold that at the time of death deceased was 56 years old. 16.Learned counsel for the respondent no.3 placed reliance on the case of Jiju Kuruvila and Ors., Vs. Kunjujamma Mohan and Ors., reported in, AIR 2013 SC 2293. In that case, it was held that mere position of vehicles after accident, as shown in the spot panchanama cannot give a substantial proof as to rash and negligent driving on the part of one or other. 17.Learned advocate for the claimants placed reliance on following case laws : 1.Shashikala & Ors., Vs. Gangalakshmamma and Anr., 13 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. Criminal Appeal No. 2836 of 2015, decided on 13th March, 2015. In that case, transport businessman of 45 years lost his life. Tribunal has awarded compensation of Rs.7,50,000/­, after applying multiplier of 13. Hon'ble High Court has enhanced amount of compensation up to Rs.14,69,372/­, after applying multiplier of 14. Hon'ble Apex Court applied multiplier of 17 and enhanced the amount of compensation for loss of future prospect of deceased. 2.Smt. Sarla Verma Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation, reported in 2009 (2) TAC 677 (SC). In that case, Hon'ble Supreme Court laid down three steps, which Tribunal should follow for determining amount of compensation to have uniformity and consistency first to ascertainment of multiplicand, 2. Ascertainment of multiplier and 3. actual calculation. In that case, in para no. 14 Hon'ble Apex Court laid down how much amount to be deducted towards personal and living expenses of the deceased. Advocate for claimant claims that 1/5th amount may be deducted towards personal and living expenses of deceased. 3.Santosh Devi Vs. national Insurance Company Ltd., and Ors., reported in, 2012 (6) LJSOFT (SC) 183. 4.Rajesh and Ors., Vs. Rajbir Singh and Ors., reported in, 2013 (3) TAC 697 (SC). In both these cases, Hon'ble Apex Court held that in case of self employed persons or persons with fixed wages the actual income of deceased must be enhanced for the purpose of compensation viz., by particular percentage after taking into account 14 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. the age group in which he falls. 5.Vimal Kanwar & Ors., Vs. Kishore Dan & Ors., reported in, 2013 (6) LJSOFT (SC) 172. In that case, it was held that in calculating the amount of compensation, generally the actual income of deceased less income tax should be the starting point. 6.Sanobanu Nazirbhai Mirza and Ors., Vs. Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service, reported in, 2013 (4) TAC 369 (SC) . In that case, Hon'ble Apex Court awarded compensation more than what was claimed by claimants. It was held that it is statutory duty of Tribunal and Hon'ble High Court to award just and reasonable compensation. 7.Kanhsingh and Anr., Vs. Tukaram and Ors., reported in, 2015 (2) TAC 689 (SC). In that case, 27 years old Manager of HDFC died. He was earning Rs.1,81,860/­ p.a. Tribunal has awarded compensation of Rs.12,10,014/­. Hon'ble High Court enhanced that amount by Rs.2,00,000/­. Hon'ble Supreme Court held that deceased had definite chances of his further promotion and consequent increase in salary, hence, his income was increased by 50% for future prospects and the compensation amount was enhanced up to Rs.24,25,604/­. 8.Radha Krishna and Anr., Vs. Gokul and Ors., reported in, 2013 (4) TAC 737 (SC) . In that case, 19 years old student of degree court of Engineering died. Tribunal has awarded compensation of Rs.1,92,000/­. Hon'ble High Court has enhanced that amount by Rs.8000/­ and made it Rs.2,00,000/­. Hon'ble Supreme Court 15 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. enhanced that amount and awarded a lump sum compensation of Rs.7,00,000/­ to the parents of deceased. 9.Raj Rani and Ors., Vs. Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd., and Ors., reported in, 2009 AC 1 (SC). In that case, it was held that allowance other than dearness allowance, if beneficial to the entire family should be taken in to consideration for the purpose of assessment of income of the deceased and computation of compensation. 10.Sunil Sharma & Ors., Vs. Bachitar Singh & Ors., reported in, 2011 ALL SCR 1206. In that case, it was held that deduction made on account of H.R.A., C.C.A., medical allowance, E.P.F. and G.I.S. should not have been made in calculating income of deceased. 18. If average income for last 3 years of deceased is calculated from form no.16 (3,14,607/­ + 2,78,164/­+ 3,28,826/­ =9,21,597/3=3,07,199/­) it comes to Rs.3,07,199/­. At the time of death he was 56 years old. Advocate for claimants in his argument placed reliance on para no.12 of judgment of Shashikala (cited supra) and claimed that deceased was working in a private company and there is no fixed age of superannuation. Therefore, while calculating the amount of compensation, the actual income of deceased required to be enhanced by 15% towards future prospects for the purpose of calculation of compensation. In case of Sarla Varma (cited supra) held that in case of those above 50 years, there shall be no addition towards future prospects. In this case, it has specifically come on 16 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. record through the evidence P.W. 02 Santosh Narwarde that as per policy of the company in which deceased was working, the normal age of retirement is 58 years. Therefore, the ratio laid down in Shashikala's case (cited supra) is not applicable to this case. Hence, there is no question of enhancement of income of deceased for calculation of compensation on account of future prospects. The deceased left behind 3 dependents hence 1/3th amount out of it i.e. Rs.1,02,400/­ is deducted towards his personal income. To his age group Multiplier of 8 is applicable. Therefore towards loss of dependency claimants are entitled to get Rs.2,04,799 X 8 = 16,38,392/­. In addition to that towards non pecuniary compensation they are entitled to get following amounts. For loss of consortium claimant no.1 is entitled to get Rs. 1,00,000/­ and towards loss of love and affection all claimants are entitled to get Rs. 50,000/­ each and Rs. 25000/­ towards Funeral charges. Therefore claimants are entitled to get Rs. 19,13,392/­ including NFL amount. 19. Vehicle information extract of said truck filed at exh.30 proves that said truck was insured with respondent no.3 for the period 13­2­2015 to 12­2­2016. The accident was happened on 3­3­2015 thus at the time of accident the truck was validly and effectively insured with respondent no.3 Therefore in light of this factual and legal position I hold that respondent no.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay Rs. 19,13,392/­ to the claimants. 17 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. ORDER 1) Claim Petition is partly allowed. 2)The respondent Nos. 1 to 3 are directed to jointly and severally pay Rs. 19,13,392/­ towards compensation together with interest @ rate of 9% p.a. from the date of this claim petition till its realization. 3)After deposit of said compensation amount,Rs. 6,04,464/­ each be given to the share of claimant nos.2 &3. Amount of Rs. 7,04,464/­ be given to share of claimant no.1. Out of amount of share of claimant no. 1, to 3 Rs. 2,00,000 each be invested in the fixed deposit scheme of any nationalized bank for the period of 3 years. Rest of the amount after adjusting NFL amount be paid to them by an account payee crossed cheque. 4)Award be drawn accordingly. Dt. 21.10.2016 ( S.S. Gosavi ) Member, MACT, Aurangabad. P.T.O. 18 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. ORDER BELOW JUDGMENT 01.In this case after delivery of judgment on 25.10.2016, claimants have filed application at Exh.55 for correction in the judgment and award. Advocate for insurance company raised objection to that application. After hearing both the parties, I make following correction in the judgment. A.While calculating the income from salary of deceased, this Court has placed reliance on Form No. 16, produced by claimants of deceased Sunil Anantprasad Dixit, issued by his employer Techno­ Craft Toolings, for the year 2012­13 at Exh.43, 2013­14 at Exh.44 and 2014­15 at Exh.45. After making total of income of said years average yearly income of deceased was calculated and on its basis amount of compensation was awarded. However, while taking the figures of amount from the From No.16, due to over sight wrong figure was taken. His income from salary is in the taxable range. Therefore, for calculating his income from salary, actual salary less tax required to be taken in to account. Therefore, correction in the judgment is necessary. Actually, figure of gross salary of Rs. 3,44,029/­ ­ Professional Tax Rs.2500/­ ­ Income Tax Rs. 12,000/­ = Rs.3,29,529/­ + 4,13,848 – Professional Tax Rs.2500/­ ­ Income Tax Rs.10,000/­ = 4,01,348/­ + Rs.4,70,115/­ ­ Professional Tax Rs. 2300/­ ­ Income Tax of Rs.14000/­ = 4,53,815/­ (3,29,529 + 4,01,348/­ + 4,53,815 = 11,84,692/­). Therefore, average annual 19 MACP No. 497 of 2015 Judgment. income of deceased for last three years prior to his death comes to Rs.11,84,692/3 = 3,94,897/­. Letter of revision of salary issued by Technocraft Toolings to the deceased, filed at Exh.38, pay slip of the deceased for the month of December­2014 to March­2015, copy of certificates U/sec. 203 of Income Tax Act, for the deduction of tax at source on salary for the assessment year 2012­13, 2013­14 and 2014­ 15, duly supported the figures of income. 02.At the time of death, he was 50 years old. Hence, there shall be no addition towards future prospect. The deceased left behind three dependents, hence, 1/3rd amount out of it i.e. Rs. 1,31,632/­ (Rs.3,94,897/­ – Rs.1,31,632/­ = Rs.2,63,265/­). To this multiplier of 8 is applicable. Therefore, 2,63,265/­ X 8 = Rs.21,06,120/­. In addition to that the claimant no.1 is entitled to get Rs.1,00,000/­ towards loss of consortium. Towards loss of love and affection all claimants are entitled to get Rs.50,000/­ each and Rs.25,000/­ towards funeral charges. Therefore, claimants are entitled to get Rs.23,81,120/­ including NFL amount, if any paid. B.All four claimants appeared before me and informed that while doing apportionment of compensation, more amount of compensation may be given to claimant nos.1 and 2. Therefore, suitable changes have been made as under : 1.After deposit of amount of Rs.23,81,120/­, from out of that amount Rs.9,90,560/­ be given to the share of claimant no.1.

[ 2] M.A.C.P.No.739/2015, [Judgment]. J U D G M E N T [ Delivered on 24th November, 2016 ] The present claim petition is filed U/s 166 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 for grant of compensation of Rs.5,00,000/­, in respect of unfortunate death of deceased Ganesh Dyandev Bojne, in the motor accident. 2.According to the claimants, on 22.09.2015 at about 4.30 to 5.00 p.m. the deceased Ganesh Dyandev Bojne was proceeding from Kasadgaon to Wakudni on his bicycle. When he reached on highway infront of field of Sanjay Rode, at that time, S.T.Bus bearing No.MH­06­S­8718 came in high speed, rash and negligent manner, without following traffic rules and gave dash to the bicycle of deceased Ganesh Dyandev Bojne due to which accident occurred and the deceased sustained serious injuries. He was admitted in Ghati Hospital for treatment but he died during the course of treatment. 3.On the basis of information, the police authorities from Karmad Police Station registered Crime bearing No.I­188/2015 against respondent No.1 the driver of S.T.Bus bearing No.MH­06­S­7818 U/s 304­A, 279,338 of IPC. 4.The claimants further contended that at the time of accident, the deceased was 14 years old possessing good personality and was the only earning hand in the family. The father of deceased has also died in the road accident. The mother­claimant No.1 is suffering from diabetes and blood pressure. The [ 3] M.A.C.P.No.739/2015, [Judgment]. claimant No.2 younger brother of deceased is school going boy and studying in 7th standard. They further contended that the deceased was doing agricultural work on agricultural land owned by claimant No.1 bearing Gut No.72 situated at Kawadgaon and was getting income of Rs.5000/­ per month from the said agricultural field and was maintaining the claimants who were fully dependent upon him and he was also taking education in school. The claimants further contended that the deceased was helping hand of the family and because of his unfortunate death, the entire family is disturbed and are suffering financially. Hence, they have filed the present claim petition for grant of compensation to the tune of Rs.5,00,000/­ from the respondents under all heads. 5.Respondent No.1 filed his Written Statement at Exh­19 and contended that it is well known fact that the drivers and conductors of S.T.Buses are well trained and after getting necessary training they are allowed to ply the vehicles on public road. The drivers of S.T.Buses are plying their vehicles on road by taking all kinds of preventive measures in their mind. He further contended that the complaint is lodged on the basis of information given by the claimants and accordingly, the same if reported in such a way so as to transfer the liability on the shoulders of driver of S.T.Bus. He further denied the age, income of the deceased and submitted that the claim petition be rejected. 6.Respondent No.2 filed their Written Statement at Exh­14 and took [ 4] M.A.C.P.No.739/2015, [Judgment]. the stand taken by respondent No.1 and submitted that the petition be rejected. 7.From the pleadings of the parties, I have framed issues at Exh­20 and I record my findings against each of them for the reasons discussed below. I S S U E S F I N D I N G S 1.Whether the claimants prove that deceased Ganesh Dyandev bojne died in a motor accident on 22.9.2015 ? ..Yes. 2.Whether the claimants prove that respondent No.1 was driving S.T.Bus bearing No. MH­06­S­8718 in a rash and negligent manner and because of which the said accident occurred ? .. Yes. 3.Whether claimants are entitle for compensation, if yes, to what extent and from whom ? .. Yes, Rs.4,30,000/­ including the amount of N.F.L.from Respondent No.1&2 jointly and severally @ 8% p.a. from the date of institution of petition, till realisation of entire amount. 4.What order and award ? .. As per final order. R E A S O N S 8.In support of petition, the claimants have examined claimant No.1 as CW1 at Exh­21 and has filed certified copies of following documents­ F.I.R. at Exh­24, Spot Panchanama at Exh­25, Inquest Panchanama at Exh­26, Provisional Postmortem Report at Exh­27, Postmortem Report at [ 5] M.A.C.P.No.739/2015, [Judgment]. Exh­28 and Bonafide Certificate of Chatrapati Sambhaji Madhyamik & Uchha Madhyamik Vidyalaya at Exh­29. 9.Respondent No.1 & 2 has not adduce any evidence. As to Issue No.1 & 2 : 10.The claimant CW1 has deposed in her deposition that on 22.9.2015 at about 4.30 to 5.00 p.m. the deceased Ganesh Dyandev Bojne was proceeding from Kawadgaon to Wakudni on his bicycle. When he reached on highway infront of field of sanjay Rode, at that time, S.T.Bus bearing No. MH­06­S­8718 came in high speed, rash and negligent manner and without following traffic rules, gave dash to the bicycle of deceased, due to which the accident occurred. The testimony of claimant is supported by documents filed at Exh­24, 25. The documents shows that at the relevant time, the respondent the driver of S.T.Bus bearing No. MH­06­S­8718 was driving the bus in rash and negligent manner. The driver of S.T.Bus has not step in witness box so as to rebut the testimony of CW1 and document filed by her. The documents filed at Exh­27 & 28 shows that the cause of death is 'shock and hemorrhage due to injuries to vital organ', which shows that the deceased has died because of the injuries sustained in the accident. Hence, I answer Issue No.1 & 2 as 'Yes'. As to Issue No.3 & 4 : 11.The claimant CW1 has deposed in her evidence that at the time of [ 6] M.A.C.P.No.739/2015, [Judgment]. accident, the deceased was 14 years of old having good personality and was helping hand of the family. He used to do agriculture work and earn Rs.5000/­ per month, from the agricultural land owned by CW1 bearing Gut No.72, situated at Kawadgaon, Tq. & District Aurangabad. The deceased was also taking his education in school. She further deposed that her husband has already died in the motor accident. She is a diabetic patient and suffering from blood pressure. The claimant No.2 is minor brother of deceased and is taking education. The entire family was dependent upon the income of the deceased. She was cross examined but nothing incriminating has come in evidence. So far as the age of deceased is concern, she has filed bonafide certificate of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Madhyamik & Uchha Madhyamik Vidyalaya, Wakudni, Tq. Badnapur at Exh­29. The date of birth of deceased is mentioned as 03.03.2001 in the said certificate. So far as the income is concern, no documentary evidence is filed by her. She has filed 7/12 Extract of Gut no.72, but the same was not proved by her. 12.The Learned advocate appearing for the claimants submitted that the deceased was minor but was not non­earning member. He was doing agriculture work in the field of claimant No.1 and earning his livelihood and supporting the family. Therefore, the notional income of Rs.30,000/­ per year be taken as the income of deceased and relied upon the judgment passed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kishan Gopal & Anr. Vs Lala & Ors. Reported in [ 7] M.A.C.P.No.739/2015, [Judgment]. 2013 CJ (SC) 2336 . 13.The Learned advocate appearing for the respondent submitted that the deceased was minor and studying in school, he was non­earning member and, therefore, the notional income of Rs.15,000/­ per annum be taken into consideration as per the II Schedule of Motor Vehicles act, 1988. 14.It appears from the testimony of CW1 that her husband has already died. Her son was 14 years old and was helping her in doing agriculture work. Even­though the 7/12 Extract filed by her was not exhibited and proved by her even though the same being revenue document, has a presumptive value. The document therefore is taken by me into consideration. The document shows that the claimant No.1 owned agricultural land. Therefore, it cannot be said that the deceased may not be helping her in doing agriculture work. In our country, in rural areas, most probably the children of 13 to 14 years help their parents in agriculture work. Therefore, I am inclined to take notional income of 30,000/­ as applied by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kishan Gopal Vs Lala & Ors as the notional income of deceased. CW1 has put on record the bonafide certificate of School authority at Exh­29 and as per the said certificate, the date of birth of deceased was 03.03.2001. The accident has taken place on 22.09.2015. It shows that the deceased was 14 years old at the time of accident. The II Schedule of Motor Vehicles Act shows that the multiplier of 15 is to be applied up to the age [ 8] M.A.C.P.No.739/2015, [Judgment]. of 15 years. Therefore, the multiplier of 15 is applied in the present case. By taking into consideration annual contribution of Rs.30,000/­ and by applying multiplier of 15, the loss of future earning will be Rs.4,50,000/­. Considering the age of deceased, I find that the deduction of Rs.1,00,000/­ would be fair and appropriate, on account of personal expenses of the deceased. The Hon'ble Apex Court in case of Kaushlya Devi Vs Karan Arora & Ors . Reported in 2007 ALL SCR 1857 has awarded compensation of Rs.55,000/­ as future prospectus. Therefore, I am inclined to grant Rs.55,000/­ as future prospectus of the deceased. I am further inclined to grant Rs.25,000/­ towards funeral expenses of the deceased. The mother has lost her child in the said accident. Therefore, as per the principle laid down in the case of M. Mansoor and Anr. Vs United India Insurance Co.Ltd., reported in 2013 12 Scale 324 , I am inclined to grant her Rs.50,000/­ towards love and affection of child. Therefore, the claimants are entitle to compensation to the tune of Rs.4,80,000/­. 15.So as to rate of interest is concern, considering the pendency of petition and the compensation amount, the interest of 8% per annum will be just and proper in the present case. The claimants have already received an amount of Rs.50,000/­ as interim compensation under the head of No Fault Liability. Therefore, it will be just and proper to deduct the said amount from the amount of compensation. [ 9] M.A.C.P.No.739/2015, [Judgment]. 16.The documents on record shows that the offending S.T.Bus bearing No.MH­06­S­8718 was driven by respondent No.1 and was owned by respondent No.2, at the time of accident. Therefore, respondent No.1 & 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the claimants. Hence, I answer Issue No.3 accordingly and in answer to Issue No.4, I pass following order. O R D E R 1.The petition is partly allowed. 2.The respondent No.1 & 2 do pay Rs.4,30,000/­ as compensation to claimants excluding the amount under the head of 'No Fault Liability', jointly and severally along with interest @ 8% per annum, from the date of institution of petition, till realisation of entire amount. 3.On deposit of claim amount, it be appropriated amongst claimants as under­ i)An amount of Rs.1,50,000/­ be deposited in the name of claimant No.1, in any Nationalized Bank, for the period of two years and the amount of Rs.1,30,000/­ be paid to her by account payee cheque on proper identification. ii)An amount of Rs.1,50,000/­ be deposited in the name of claimant No.2, in any Nationalized Bank, till he attains majority. 4.Respondent No.1 & 2 do pay proportionate cost of the petition to the claimants and bear their own cost. 5.Award be drawn accordingly.

Achame, Advocate for claimants Shri M.A. Aher, Advocate for respondent No.1 Shri R.S. Chandre, Advocate for respondent No.2 ________________________________________ JUDGMENT (Delivered on : 04.07.2017) 1.The present petition is filed under Section 166 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 seeking compensation of Rs.7,00,000/- due to accidental death of Dhanesh @ Dhananjay Sunil Gavane in motor vehicular accident. 2.Brief facts, giving rise to this petition, are as under :- On 18.10.2014 at about 12.30 hours near Mharoda Phata on Paithan-Aurangabad road, deceased Dhanesh Gavane was going to attend his work on motorcycle bearing registration No.MH-20-CG-7312. At that time, respondent No.1 by driving his motorcycle bearing registration No.MH-20-CZ-2491 (for short, 'the offending vehicle') in very high speed and in rash and negligent manner, without observing situation of the road and negligently gave dash to the motorcycle of Dhanesh. In said accident, Dhanesh sustained multiple injuries. 3 M.A.C.P. No.36/2015 [Judgment] 3.After the accident, Dhanesh was shifted to Rural Hospital, Bidkin, where the concerned medical officer declared him dead. Accordingly, postmortem was conducted on the dead body of deceased Dhanesh. 4.Crime No.I-195/2014 was registered under Section 304-A, 279,337,338 of The Indian Penal Code against driver of the offending vehicle i.e. against respondent No.1 at Bidkin police station, Dist. Aurangabad. 5.Deceased Dhanesh Gavane was 20 years old at the time of the accident. He was working as labour and carpenter. From said work, deceased Dhanesh was earning more than Rs.8,000/- per month. The claimants were fully dependent upon the earnings of the deceased. But, due to untimely death of Dhanesh @ Dhananjay Gavane, the claimants are suffering from financial hardship. The claimants have calculated amount of compensation under different heads to the tune of Rs.20,13,000/-. However, they have restricted their claim to Rs.7,00,000/-. 6.At the time of the accident, respondent No.1 was owner and driver of the offending vehicle, which was validly insured with respondent No. 2. The claimants claimed compensation of 4 M.A.C.P. No.36/2015 [Judgment] Rs.7,00,000/- alongwith interest @18% p.a. from respondent Nos.1 and 2 jointly and severally. 7.Respondent No. 1 has filed his written statement/ say at Exh. 13 and denied the contents of the petition. It is denied that, the accident took place due to his rash and negligent driving. The concerned police have registered false crime against him. It is denied that, the offending vehicle was involved in the accident. It is denied that, deceased Dhanesh was 20 years of age and was earning more than Rs.8,000/- per month from labour and carpenter work at the time of the accident. It is submitted that, one Jeep which was coming from Paithan towards Aurangabad gave dash to motorcycle of the deceased and ran away towards Aurangabad. It is further submitted that, on the alleged date and time of the accident, the offending vehicle was validly insured with respondent No.2- Insurance Company. Therefore, if at all the claimants found entitled to compensation, respondent No.2 be ordered to pay the same. Lastly, he prayed to dismiss the petition against him. 8.Respondent No. 2 filed its written statement at Exh.22 and denied the contents of the claim petition. It is denied that, the 5 M.A.C.P. No.36/2015 [Judgment] offending vehicle was covered at the material time under the policy of insurance. Respondent No.1 was not holding effective and valid driving license to drive the offending vehicle at the relevant time. The offending vehicle was falsely involved in the accident by the petitioners in collusion with the police authorities. It is denied that, the deceased was 20 years of age and was earning more than Rs.8,000/- per month at the relevant time of the accident. It is submitted that, the deceased himself is responsible for the accident. Lastly, it is prayed to dismiss the petition against it. 9.Following issues are framed at Exh. 20. I record my findings thereon for the reasons stated thereafter. ISSUES FINDINGS 1.Whether due to rash and negligent driving of motorcycle bearing registration No.MH-20-CZ-2491 the accident occurred and as a consequence thereof Dhanesh @Dhananjay Sunil Gavane died ?In the affirmative 2.Whether the claimants are entitled to get compensation ? If yes, what should be the quantum ?In the affirmative as per final order 3.Who is liable to pay the compensation ? Respondent Nos.1 and 2 jointly and severally 4.What award ? As per final order 6 M.A.C.P. No.36/2015 [Judgment] REASONS 10.In order to substantiate the claim petition, on behalf of the claimants, claimant No.1 Sunil Vishwanath Gavane filed his affidavit of examination-in-chief at Exh. 38 and closed their evidence vide purshis at Exh.40. Apart from this, the claimants have filed on record certified copies of FIR (Exh.24),Spot panchnama (Exh.25), Police report forwarded to Civil Surgeon for postmortem examination (Exh.26), Inquest panchnama (Exh.27), Memorandum of postmortem examination (Exh.29), Certificate of registration of offending vehicle (Exh.30), Motor driving license of respondent No.1 (Exh.31), Insurance cover note (Exh.32), Statement of claimant No.1 (Exh.35), Form AA (Exh.37), Chargesheet (Exh. 42), Report (Exh.43). AS TO ISSUE No.1 :- 11. Claimant No.1 Sunil Vishwanath Gavane reiterated same facts of the petition in his affidavit of evidence. During his cross-examination by Advocate for respondent Nos.1 and 2, he denied all adverse suggestions. Evidence of this witness on the fact of the accident is not refuted by the respondents during his cross- 7 M.A.C.P. No.36/2015 [Judgment] examination. Concerned police investigated the case and filed charge-sheet against respondent No.1 i.e. driver of the offending vehicle. The factum of the accident is supported by spot panchnama (Exh.25). Registration of offence against respondent No.1 prima facie shows his negligence. Perusal of record shows that, respondent No.1 has not challenged the charges levelled against him. So also, respondent No. 1 did not step into the witness box to prove his innocence. The police papers filed on record are not denied by the respondents. Respondent Nos.1 and 2 have not examined any witness nor brought any rebuttal evidence on record. 12.Memorandum of a postmortem examination (Exh.29) shows that, postmortem on dead body of Dhanesh Sunil Gavane was conducted on 18.10.2014. It is mentioned in said report that, deceased Dhanesh died due to 'cardio respiratory arrest due to haemo thorax following RTA'. Inquest panchnama (Exh.27) also shows that, deceased Dhanesh Gavane died on 18.10.2014 i.e. on the date of the accident. In the light of above discussion, it is proved that, due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle, the accident occurred and in said accident Dhanesh @Dhananjay Sunil 8 M.A.C.P. No.36/2015 [Judgment] Gavane died. Hence, I answer issue No.1 accordingly in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NOs. 2 & 3 :- 13.Claimant No.1 is father and claimant No.2 is mother of deceased Dhananjay. There is no specific income of the claimants on record. Therefore, the claimants, being dependents, are entitled to get compensation on account of accidental death of Dhanesh Sunil Gavane. 14. On the point of income of the deceased, it is contended in the claim petition that, the deceased was doing labour and carpenter work and was getting monthly income of Rs.8,000/-. The claimants though filed on record documents showing income of the deceased, they have not examined any witness to prove those documents. 15.Learned Advocate for respondent Nos. 1 and 2 argued that, for want of income proof of the deceased, notional income of the deceased be taken as Rs.3,000/- per month. 16.As discussed earlier, it is not proved by the claimants that, the deceased was earning Rs.8,000/- per month. In such 9 M.A.C.P. No.36/2015 [Judgment] circumstances, it would be just and proper to take notional income of the deceased. Considering the period of accident as well as rates of wages prevailant at that time, notional income of the deceased is taken as Rs.4,000/- per month. 17.Deceased Dhanesh Gavane was unmarried. Therefore, one-half of his monthly income towards his personal expenses, had he been alive, should be deducted. After said deduction, loss of dependency would be Rs.2,000/- per month. Annual loss of dependency would be Rs.24,000/- (Rs.2,000 x 12). 18.The claimants have contended in their petition age of the deceased as 20 years at the time of the accident. The claimants have not filed on record any document to show exact age of the deceased. On postmortem report (Exh.29), age of the deceased is shown as 20 years. Therefore, it is held that, deceased Dhanesh was 20 years of age at the time of the accident. As per ratio laid down in Sarla Verma & Ors. vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & Anr., 2009 ACJ 1298, multiplier of 18 will have to be taken. Thus, total amount of compensation comes to Rs.4,32,000/- (Rs.24,000 x 18). 19.Apart from this, the claimants are entitled to 10 M.A.C.P. No.36/2015 [Judgment] Rs.1,00,000/-for loss of love and affection and Rs.25,000/- for funeral expenses. Thus, the claimants are entitled to total amount of compensation of Rs. 5,57,000/- on all counts. 20.It is held while discussing Issue No.1 that, the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No.1. As per police papers, respondent No.1 was owner and driver of the offending vehicle and it was validly insured with respondent No.2 at the time of the accident. Therefore, respondent Nos. 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the claimants. Hence, I answer Issue Nos.2 and 3 accordingly as mentioned against it and in answer to issue No.4, pass following order :- ORDER The Petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs as under :- 1]Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 jointly and severally do pay Rs.5,57,000/- (Rs.Five Lakh Fifty- seven Thousand only) (inclusive of NFL amount) alongwith interest @ 8% per annum from the date of the petition till its realization to the claimants. 11 M.A.C.P. No.36/2015 [Judgment] 2]On deposit of amount of compensation in the office of this Tribunal, it be distributed equally between claimant Nos. 1 and 2 by giving account payee cheques in their respective names on due identification. 3]Award be drawn accordingly.

MACP NO.284/2015 (Judgment) 13.Heard learned Counsel, Shri.Quazi for the claimants and learned Counsel Shri.Osmankar for the respondent no.1 filed written notes of arguments. 14.The claimants also filed written notes of arguments. ISSUE NO.1 : 15.The claimant no.1 testified in her affidavit that due to the rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by the respondent no.3, the accident took place. 16.During her cross­examination, it was suggested that the said accident took palce while deceased was crossing the road. The said suggestion was denied. 17.Besides that suggestion, there is no other evidence from the respondents. 18. – Exh.23 is the certified copy of FIR, –Exh.24 is the certified copy of spot panchnama, –Exh.25 is the certified copy of Inquest panchnama, –Exh.26 is the provisional cause of death certificate, .. 6 ..

ISSUE NO.2 : 21.In view of answering issue no.1 in the affirmative, the claimants being the legal representatives of deceased Vithal are entitled to claim compensation. As per the inquest panchnama and the postmortem report, deceased Vithal was 55 years old. The claimants did not produce any document of age proof or income proof. The claimants claimed that deceased Vithal was working as a labour in the Sugar­cane Factory. 22.In the light of aforesaid facts and circumstances the age of deceased Vithal is taken 55 years old. Considering the totality of .. 7 .. MACP NO.284/2015 (Judgment) circumstances, the income of deceased Vithal is taken Rs.7,000/­ per month. 23.As per the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of “Sarla Varma V/s Delhi Transport” , 1/3rd amount needs to be deducted towards personal expenses of deceased Vithal and the multiplier of 11 is to be applied for calculating the compensation. The learned Counsel, Shri.Osmanpurkar for the respondent no.1 submitted during the course of argument that for want of pleading and evidence, future prospects can not be granted. He relied upon the judgment of Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of “ The New India Assurance Co.Ltd V/s Smt.Alpa Rajesh Shaha,reported in 2014(2) Mh.L.J.17” . In the said case the Hon'ble Bombay High Court held that there is no prohibition to consider the future prospects of increase in the earning of deceased, though deceased was self employed. However, the claimants are required to produce satisfactory evidence to show that there were genuine prospects of increase or enhancing in the earning of deceased. 24.The Hon'ble Supreme Court, in the case of “Rajesh and Ors. V/s Rajbir Singh and Ors, 2013(6) SCALE 563 (S.C.) ”, held that future prospects @ 15% needs to be added if the deceased was between 50 years to 60 years old. .. 8 .. MACP NO.284/2015 (Judgment) 25.In the case in hand, deceased Vithal was not carrying any self­business. He was working as a labour in the Sugar­cane Factory. 26.Taking into consideration, the observations of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of “Rajesh and Ors. V/s Rajbir Singh and Ors”, and the nature of the job of deceased Vithal and his age, 15% addition needs to be given towards future prospects. 27.The compensation is accordingly calculated as follows –Annual Income of deceased ­­ Rs.7,000/­x12= Rs.84,000/­ –1/3rd deduction towards personal expenses – Rs.84,000/­ – 28,000/­ = Rs.56,000/­. (Net annual loss of income) –Addition of 15% future prospects – Rs.56,000/­ + 8,400/­ = Rs.64,400/­. (Total annual loss of income) –Total loss of dependency – Rs.64,400/­ x 11 = Rs,7,08,400/­. 28.The claimant no.1 being widow is entitled for Rs.1 Lac towards loss of consortium, claimant no.2 and 3 are entitled for Rs.50,000/­ each towards loss of care and protection and the claimants are entitled for Rs.25,000/­ towards funeral expenses. 29.The claimants are entitled for total compensation .. 9 .. MACP NO.284/2015 (Judgment) Rs.9,33,400. I accordingly answer issue no.2. ISSUE NO.3 : 30.The claimant is entitled to recover the said amount of compensation jointly and severally from the respondent nos.1 to 3. 31.As per the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of “Rajesh and Ors. V/s Rajbir Singh and Ors ”, the claimants are also entitled for interest @ 8 % p.a. from the date of petition. Accordingly I answer issue no.3 and proceed to pass the following order. O R D E R 1)The claim is allowed with costs. 2)The respondent nos.1, 2 and 3 are directed jointly and severally to pay Rs.9,33,400/­ along with interest @ 8% p.a. from the date of petition till actual payment after deducting the NFL amount, if paid. 3)Out of this total amount including interest and costs, Rs.4,66,700/­ be paid to the claimant no.1, out of which, Rs.2,25,000/­ be deposited in fixed deposit in any Nationalized Bank in her name for five years. 4)Out of the aforesaid total amount Rs.2,33,350/­ each be paid to the claimant nos.2 and 3, out of which Rs.1,25,000/­ each be deposited in fixed deposit in any Nationalized Bank in their names for five years. .. 10 ..

Achame, Advocate for claimants Shri M.A. Aher, Advocate for respondent No.1 Shri R.S.

At that time, respondent No.1 by driving his motorcycle bearing registration No.MH-20-CZ-2491 (for short, 'the offending vehicle') in very high speed and in rash and negligent manner, without observing situation of the road and negligently gave dash to the motorcycle of Dhanesh. In said accident, Dhanesh sustained multiple injuries. 3 M.A.C.P. No.36/2015 [Judgment] 3.After the accident, Dhanesh was shifted to Rural Hospital, Bidkin, where the concerned medical officer declared him dead. Accordingly, postmortem was conducted on the dead body of deceased Dhanesh. 4.Crime No.I-195/2014 was registered under Section 304-A, 279,337,338 of The Indian Penal Code against driver of the offending vehicle i.e. against respondent No.1 at Bidkin police station, Dist. Aurangabad. 5.Deceased Dhanesh Gavane was 20 years old at the time of the accident. He was working as labour and carpenter. From said work, deceased Dhanesh was earning more than Rs.8,000/- per month. The claimants were fully dependent upon the earnings of the deceased. But, due to untimely death of Dhanesh @ Dhananjay Gavane, the claimants are suffering from financial hardship. The claimants have calculated amount of compensation under different heads to the tune of Rs.20,13,000/-. However, they have restricted their claim to Rs.7,00,000/-. 6.At the time of the accident, respondent No.1 was owner and driver of the offending vehicle, which was validly insured with respondent No. 2. The claimants claimed compensation of 4 M.A.C.P. No.36/2015 [Judgment] Rs.7,00,000/- alongwith interest @18% p.a. from respondent Nos.1 and 2 jointly and severally. 7.Respondent No. 1 has filed his written statement/ say at Exh. 13 and denied the contents of the petition. It is denied that, the accident took place due to his rash and negligent driving. The concerned police have registered false crime against him. It is denied that, the offending vehicle was involved in the accident. It is denied that, deceased Dhanesh was 20 years of age and was earning more than Rs.8,000/- per month from labour and carpenter work at the time of the accident. It is submitted that, one Jeep which was coming from Paithan towards Aurangabad gave dash to motorcycle of the deceased and ran away towards Aurangabad. It is further submitted that, on the alleged date and time of the accident, the offending vehicle was validly insured with respondent No.2- Insurance Company. Therefore, if at all the claimants found entitled to compensation, respondent No.2 be ordered to pay the same. Lastly, he prayed to dismiss the petition against him. 8.Respondent No. 2 filed its written statement at Exh.22 and denied the contents of the claim petition. It is denied that, the 5 M.A.C.P. No.36/2015 [Judgment] offending vehicle was covered at the material time under the policy of insurance. Respondent No.1 was not holding effective and valid driving license to drive the offending vehicle at the relevant time. The offending vehicle was falsely involved in the accident by the petitioners in collusion with the police authorities. It is denied that, the deceased was 20 years of age and was earning more than Rs.8,000/- per month at the relevant time of the accident. It is submitted that, the deceased himself is responsible for the accident. Lastly, it is prayed to dismiss the petition against it. 9.Following issues are framed at Exh. 20. I record my findings thereon for the reasons stated thereafter. ISSUES FINDINGS 1.Whether due to rash and negligent driving of motorcycle bearing registration No.MH-20-CZ-2491 the accident occurred and as a consequence thereof Dhanesh @Dhananjay Sunil Gavane died ?In the affirmative 2.Whether the claimants are entitled to get compensation ? If yes, what should be the quantum ?In the affirmative as per final order 3.Who is liable to pay the compensation ? Respondent Nos.1 and 2 jointly and severally 4.What award ? As per final order 6 M.A.C.P. No.36/2015 [Judgment] REASONS 10.In order to substantiate the claim petition, on behalf of the claimants, claimant No.1 Sunil Vishwanath Gavane filed his affidavit of examination-in-chief at Exh. 38 and closed their evidence vide purshis at Exh.40. Apart from this, the claimants have filed on record certified copies of FIR (Exh.24),Spot panchnama (Exh.25), Police report forwarded to Civil Surgeon for postmortem examination (Exh.26), Inquest panchnama (Exh.27), Memorandum of postmortem examination (Exh.29), Certificate of registration of offending vehicle (Exh.30), Motor driving license of respondent No.1 (Exh.31), Insurance cover note (Exh.32), Statement of claimant No.1 (Exh.35), Form AA (Exh.37), Chargesheet (Exh. 42), Report (Exh.43). AS TO ISSUE No.1 :- 11. Claimant No.1 Sunil Vishwanath Gavane reiterated same facts of the petition in his affidavit of evidence. During his cross-examination by Advocate for respondent Nos.1 and 2, he denied all adverse suggestions. Evidence of this witness on the fact of the accident is not refuted by the respondents during his cross- 7 M.A.C.P. No.36/2015 [Judgment] examination. Concerned police investigated the case and filed charge-sheet against respondent No.1 i.e. driver of the offending vehicle. The factum of the accident is supported by spot panchnama (Exh.25). Registration of offence against respondent No.1 prima facie shows his negligence. Perusal of record shows that, respondent No.1 has not challenged the charges levelled against him. So also, respondent No. 1 did not step into the witness box to prove his innocence. The police papers filed on record are not denied by the respondents. Respondent Nos.1 and 2 have not examined any witness nor brought any rebuttal evidence on record. 12.Memorandum of a postmortem examination (Exh.29) shows that, postmortem on dead body of Dhanesh Sunil Gavane was conducted on 18.10.2014. It is mentioned in said report that, deceased Dhanesh died due to 'cardio respiratory arrest due to haemo thorax following RTA'. Inquest panchnama (Exh.27) also shows that, deceased Dhanesh Gavane died on 18.10.2014 i.e. on the date of the accident. In the light of above discussion, it is proved that, due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle, the accident occurred and in said accident Dhanesh @Dhananjay Sunil 8 M.A.C.P. No.36/2015 [Judgment] Gavane died. Hence, I answer issue No.1 accordingly in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NOs. 2 & 3 :- 13.Claimant No.1 is father and claimant No.2 is mother of deceased Dhananjay. There is no specific income of the claimants on record. Therefore, the claimants, being dependents, are entitled to get compensation on account of accidental death of Dhanesh Sunil Gavane. 14. On the point of income of the deceased, it is contended in the claim petition that, the deceased was doing labour and carpenter work and was getting monthly income of Rs.8,000/-. The claimants though filed on record documents showing income of the deceased, they have not examined any witness to prove those documents. 15.Learned Advocate for respondent Nos. 1 and 2 argued that, for want of income proof of the deceased, notional income of the deceased be taken as Rs.3,000/- per month. 16.As discussed earlier, it is not proved by the claimants that, the deceased was earning Rs.8,000/- per month. In such 9 M.A.C.P. No.36/2015 [Judgment] circumstances, it would be just and proper to take notional income of the deceased. Considering the period of accident as well as rates of wages prevailant at that time, notional income of the deceased is taken as Rs.4,000/- per month. 17.Deceased Dhanesh Gavane was unmarried. Therefore, one-half of his monthly income towards his personal expenses, had he been alive, should be deducted. After said deduction, loss of dependency would be Rs.2,000/- per month. Annual loss of dependency would be Rs.24,000/- (Rs.2,000 x 12). 18.The claimants have contended in their petition age of the deceased as 20 years at the time of the accident. The claimants have not filed on record any document to show exact age of the deceased. On postmortem report (Exh.29), age of the deceased is shown as 20 years. Therefore, it is held that, deceased Dhanesh was 20 years of age at the time of the accident. As per ratio laid down in Sarla Verma & Ors. vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & Anr., 2009 ACJ 1298, multiplier of 18 will have to be taken. Thus, total amount of compensation comes to Rs.4,32,000/- (Rs.24,000 x 18). 19.Apart from this, the claimants are entitled to 10 M.A.C.P. No.36/2015 [Judgment] Rs.1,00,000/-for loss of love and affection and Rs.25,000/- for funeral expenses. Thus, the claimants are entitled to total amount of compensation of Rs. 5,57,000/- on all counts. 20.It is held while discussing Issue No.1 that, the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No.1. As per police papers, respondent No.1 was owner and driver of the offending vehicle and it was validly insured with respondent No.2 at the time of the accident. Therefore, respondent Nos. 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the claimants. Hence, I answer Issue Nos.2 and 3 accordingly as mentioned against it and in answer to issue No.4, pass following order :- ORDER The Petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs as under :- 1]Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 jointly and severally do pay Rs.5,57,000/- (Rs.Five Lakh Fifty- seven Thousand only) (inclusive of NFL amount) alongwith interest @ 8% per annum from the date of the petition till its realization to the claimants. 11 M.A.C.P. No.36/2015 [Judgment] 2]On deposit of amount of compensation in the office of this Tribunal, it be distributed equally between claimant Nos. 1 and 2 by giving account payee cheques in their respective names on due identification. 3]Award be drawn accordingly.

Registration of offence against respondent No.1 prima facie shows his negligence. Perusal of record shows that, respondent No.1 has not challenged the charges levelled against him. So also, respondent No. 1 did not step into the witness box to prove his innocence. The police papers filed on record are not denied by the respondents. Respondent Nos.1 and 2 have not examined any witness nor brought any rebuttal evidence on record. 12.Memorandum of a postmortem examination (Exh.29) shows that, postmortem on dead body of Dhanesh Sunil Gavane was conducted on 18.10.2014. It is mentioned in said report that, deceased Dhanesh died due to 'cardio respiratory arrest due to haemo thorax following RTA'. Inquest panchnama (Exh.27) also shows that, deceased Dhanesh Gavane died on 18.10.2014 i.e. on the date of the accident. In the light of above discussion, it is proved that, due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle, the accident occurred and in said accident Dhanesh @Dhananjay Sunil 8 M.A.C.P. No.36/2015 [Judgment] Gavane died. Hence, I answer issue No.1 accordingly in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NOs. 2 & 3 :- 13.Claimant No.1 is father and claimant No.2 is mother of deceased Dhananjay. There is no specific income of the claimants on record. Therefore, the claimants, being dependents, are entitled to get compensation on account of accidental death of Dhanesh Sunil Gavane. 14. On the point of income of the deceased, it is contended in the claim petition that, the deceased was doing labour and carpenter work and was getting monthly income of Rs.8,000/-. The claimants though filed on record documents showing income of the deceased, they have not examined any witness to prove those documents. 15.Learned Advocate for respondent Nos. 1 and 2 argued that, for want of income proof of the deceased, notional income of the deceased be taken as Rs.3,000/- per month. 16.As discussed earlier, it is not proved by the claimants that, the deceased was earning Rs.8,000/- per month. In such 9 M.A.C.P. No.36/2015 [Judgment] circumstances, it would be just and proper to take notional income of the deceased. Considering the period of accident as well as rates of wages prevailant at that time, notional income of the deceased is taken as Rs.4,000/- per month. 17.Deceased Dhanesh Gavane was unmarried. Therefore, one-half of his monthly income towards his personal expenses, had he been alive, should be deducted. After said deduction, loss of dependency would be Rs.2,000/- per month. Annual loss of dependency would be Rs.24,000/- (Rs.2,000 x 12). 18.The claimants have contended in their petition age of the deceased as 20 years at the time of the accident. The claimants have not filed on record any document to show exact age of the deceased. On postmortem report (Exh.29), age of the deceased is shown as 20 years. Therefore, it is held that, deceased Dhanesh was 20 years of age at the time of the accident. As per ratio laid down in Sarla Verma & Ors. vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & Anr., 2009 ACJ 1298, multiplier of 18 will have to be taken. Thus, total amount of compensation comes to Rs.4,32,000/- (Rs.24,000 x 18). 19.Apart from this, the claimants are entitled to 10 M.A.C.P. No.36/2015 [Judgment] Rs.1,00,000/-for loss of love and affection and Rs.25,000/- for funeral expenses. Thus, the claimants are entitled to total amount of compensation of Rs. 5,57,000/- on all counts. 20.It is held while discussing Issue No.1 that, the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No.1. As per police papers, respondent No.1 was owner and driver of the offending vehicle and it was validly insured with respondent No.2 at the time of the accident. Therefore, respondent Nos. 1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the claimants. Hence, I answer Issue Nos.2 and 3 accordingly as mentioned against it and in answer to issue No.4, pass following order :- ORDER The Petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs as under :- 1]Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 jointly and severally do pay Rs.5,57,000/- (Rs.Five Lakh Fifty- seven Thousand only) (inclusive of NFL amount) alongwith interest @ 8% per annum from the date of the petition till its realization to the claimants. 11 M.A.C.P. No.36/2015 [Judgment] 2]On deposit of amount of compensation in the office of this Tribunal, it be distributed equally between claimant Nos. 1 and 2 by giving account payee cheques in their respective names on due identification. 3]Award be drawn accordingly.

At the time of an accident, Ganesh Wagh was walking by the side of road.

According to him, petition is not tenable because, there was no negligence on the part of truck driver. Deceased was crossing road without paying attention of the road situation. There is divider on the road. There is no Zebra Crossing as such. Deceased came suddenly in front of truck, therefore, there was no negligence on the part of the truck driver. An accident occurred due to sole negligence of deceased. 6)Moreover, truck in question does not have permit and fitness certificate. Truck driver is not having driving license. He he has committed breach of conditions of policy. Thus, company is not liable to pay compensation. Moreover, the age of the deceased is not correct. He was not serving anywhere, therefore, there was no income as alleged. Nobody is depend upon him. In all counts, claim is not tenable and it may be rejected. 7)Respondent nos. 2 and 3 filed written statement vide Exh. 15 and resisted the claim. According to them, truck driver had committed no fault and police has not investigated the crime in proper perspective. Deceased was crossing the road suddenly, without paying the attention, therefore, he is negligent. No accident took place as alleged. The age mentioned of the 5 [MACP No.318/2015] deceased is not correct. He was not serving anywhere. Therefore, claim is not tenable and it may rejected. 8)From the rival pleadings of the parties, issues are framed and I record my findings against each of them for the reasons given below:­ SR. NO.ISSUES FINDINGS 1)Whether the petitioners prove that, the deceased died in the motor vehicular accident dated 28/03/2015 ?: In the affirmative. 2)Whether the petitioners prove that, the deceased died in the accident due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing No. MH­04­CU­609, which is owned by respondent no. 2 ?: Partly affirmative. 3)What is just and reasonable amount of compensation and against whom it is to be awarded ?: As per final order. 4)What order and Award? :As per final order. REASONS 9) The claimants are relied upon the following documents:­ Complaint (Exh.28), Inquest Panchanama (Exh.29), Spot panchanama (Exh.30), FIR (Exh.31), Tax receipt (Exh.32), Fitness Certificate(Exh.33), AA Form(Exh.34) and PM report (Exh.35). 6 AS TO ISSUE NO.1 : 10)Claimants have alleged that, deceased died in the motor vehicular accident dated 28/03/2015. According to them, an accident occurred on 28/03/2015 at about 9.15 p.m. on Beed By Pass Road in front of Madhuban Hotel. At the time of an accident, Ganesh Wagh was walking by the side of road. At that time, truck bearing No. MH­04­CU­609 came in high speed with negligent manner and dashed to him. Due to which, he sustained serious injuries and shifted to Kamalnayan Bajaj Hospital, Aurangabad. During treatment, he expired. Police prepared inquest panchanama (Exh. 29). Anita Ghuge filed complaint vide Exh. 28. Police prepared spot panchanama (Exh. 30) and Postmortem (Exh. 35). I am of view that, an accident occurred on 28/03/2015 and he expired during treatment is an admitted fact. Considering inquest panchanama, spot panchanama, FIR, Postmortem report, claimants have proved that, he expired due to accident on 28/03/2015. Thus, I answer issue No. 1 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO. 2 : 11)Claimants have further alleged that, deceased died in an accident due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing No. MH­04­CU­609, which is owned by respondent no. 2 and duly 7 [MACP No.318/2015] insured with respondent no.1. To prove rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 3, complainant has examined himself vide Exh. 24. He has admitted in cross­examination that, “I had not seen accident personally. I had not read documents of accident. I do not know by whose fault an accident occurred. I do not know who lodged FIR. I do not know who was present at the time of spot panchanama. I do not know about an accident. I had not seen an accident spot ” Considering above admissions, it is crystal clear that, claimant no. 1 does not know how an accident occurred. He is not firmed by whose negligence an accident happened. Therefore, his testimony is not helpful to prove the negligence of truck driver. In the circumstances, it is necessary to scrutinize police papers and other relevant documents. 12)One Anita Ghuge filed complaint on 29/03/2015 vide Exh. 28. Her complaint reveals that, “She herself and deceased Ganesh were going towards Madhuban Hotel to attend a Cultural Programme. They stood on the divider in order to cross the road. When they were about to cross the road, at that time, truck in question came from Satara side and gave dash to Ganesh. Immediately, she returned back, therefore she saved herself ”. I am of view that, deceased and Anita stood on 8 divider in order to cross road. There was no Zebra Crossing. Generally, on the high way, vehicles ply in high speed, therefore, it is bounden duty of the pedestrian to cross the road by observing road situation. If person suddenly come in front of vehicle, the driver cannot stop the vehicle on the spot. Considering the circumstances, I am of view that, only truck driver is not responsible for an accident. The deceased has also contributed negligence while crossing the road. Instead of fasten entire liability on truck driver, it would be appropriate to hold 50­50% negligence. (truck driver and deceased). Not only this, claimant has not examined any eye witness to fasten entire liability on truck driver. Claimant No. 1 is not an eye witness. The complainant Anita is an eye witness, but she has been not examined. Therefore, I held equal contributory negligence. 13)Learned Advocate of the respondent has argued that, if rashness and negligence of offending vehicle is not proved, the Insurance Company is not liable to pay compensation. To support his contention, he relied upon following citations :­ 1) Narayan Kalangutkar & Anr. Vs The New India Insurance Company Ltd. & Ors. reported in 2012 (2) ALL MR 244, 2) Smt. Shahana wd/o Sk.Umar Farooq Shaikh & Oars. Vs 9 [MACP No.318/2015] Sureshsingh Thakur & Anr. Reported in 2015 (3)ALLMR 565. I am of view that, already I held 50­50 % contributory negligence on both parties. Therefore, the ratio laid down in the above citations are not applicable. 14)It is an admitted fact that, respondent no.3 was driving truck, which is owned by respondent no.2 and was duly insured with respondent no. 1. Thus, I answer issue No. 2 accordingly. AS TO ISSUE NO. 3 : 15)According to claimants, deceased Ganesh was doing service in Kamal Nayan Bajaj Hospital as Nursing Staff and was getting salary of Rs. 12,000/­ p.m. To support his contention, he has examined Dr. Natasha Verma vide Exh. 37. She has deposed that, “She is Manager, (Operation HR) at Kamal Nayan Bajaj Hospital, Aurangabad. She knows Ganesh Wagh as he was serving in Nursing Staff in the hospital since September, 2014. She has filed salary certificate (Exh.38). It bears her signature. Its contents are correct. It shows that, he got Rs.11,000/­ p.m. Therefore, there is no hesitation to conclude that, he was getting of Rs.11,000/­ p.m. As I have already held that the truck driver and deceased were equally (50­50) liable for accident. Therefore, his 50% income needs to be deducted. (His monthly income was Rs. 10 11,000 ­ 5,500 = 5,500). Therefore, his net income for deciding compensation would be Rs.5,500/­ p.m. As per School Leaving Certificate, birth date of deceased is 10/12/1992 and an accident occurred on 28/03/2015. Therefore, his age would be 23 years. 16)According to claimants, deceased was just 23 years old. Therefore, 50% future prospectus may be considered. Evidence of Dr. Verma (Exh. 37) needs to be scrutinized. She has admitted that, deceased was getting stipend of Rs. 11,000/­ p.m. and not as salary. He was trainee and not permanent employee. I am of view that, as he was getting stipend and not salary, moreover, he was not permanent employee. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to grant future prospectus. Relied upon the case of National Insurance Company Ltd., Vs. Pranay Sethi and Others, Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 25590/2014 decided on 31/10/2017 . 17)His age is 23 years, therefore, as per Sarla Verma and ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Ors. Reported in 2009 (2) T.A.C. 677 (Supreme Court ) case, the multiplier “18” would be applicable. As deceased was unmarried, therefore, there would be 50% deduction towards personal and living expenses. Considering the circumstances, I calculate the compensation as follows : 11 [MACP No.318/2015] Sr. No. Heads Calculations Rupees 1 Yearly income of deceased : Rs. 5,500 p.m. X 12 = 66,000 2 50% deduction as personal and living expenses : Rs. 66,000 – 33,000 =33,000 3 Compensation after applying multiplier of “18” : Rs. 33,000 x 18 = 5,94,000 4 Loss of Love & affection 1,00,000 5 Funeral­expenses 15,000 6 Total = 7,09,000/­ Thus, the claimants are entitled compensation of Rs. 7,09,000 /­ (Rs. Seven Lacs and Nine Thousand Only). 18) The claimants have requested to grant interest @ Rs.18% per annum. I am of the view that, the said interest would be exorbitant. Instead of that, as per Kanhsingh Vs Tukaram 2015 (2) T.A.C. 689 (Supreme Court) the interest @ Rs.9% per annum would be proper and reasonable. In view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Khenyei Vs New India Assurance Co. Ltd. (2015) 9 Supreme Court Cases 273 . The claimant can recover the compensation from the respondents jointly and severally. It is 12 a joint tortfeasors liability. Thus, I answer issue No. 3 accordingly and proceed to pass the following order:­ ORDER 1)The claim­petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs. 2)The Respondent no. 1 to 3 are held liable jointly and severally to pay the compensation. of Rs. 7,09,000/­(Rs. Seven Lacs and Nine Thousand Only) to theclaimants with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of petition, i.e. 08/05/2015, till realization of the entire payment,after deducting the NFL amount, if paid. 3)Out of awarded compensation, an amount of Rs. 4,09,000/­ (Rs.Four Lacs and Nine Thousand Only) be given to Claimant No. 1 being father. 4)Out of awarded compensation, an amount of Rs. 3,00,000/­ (Rs. Three Lacs Only) be given to Claimant No. 2 being mother. 5)Claimant nos. 3 and 4 are students, hence no separate share is allotted to them. 6)An award be drawn accordingly.

(truck driver and deceased). Not only this, claimant has not examined any eye witness to fasten entire liability on truck driver. Claimant No. 1 is not an eye witness. The complainant Anita is an eye witness, but she has been not examined. Therefore, I held equal contributory negligence. 13)Learned Advocate of the respondent has argued that, if rashness and negligence of offending vehicle is not proved, the Insurance Company is not liable to pay compensation. To support his contention, he relied upon following citations :­ 1) Narayan Kalangutkar & Anr. Vs The New India Insurance Company Ltd. & Ors. reported in 2012 (2) ALL MR 244, 2) Smt. Shahana wd/o Sk.Umar Farooq Shaikh & Oars. Vs 9 [MACP No.318/2015] Sureshsingh Thakur & Anr. Reported in 2015 (3)ALLMR 565. I am of view that, already I held 50­50 % contributory negligence on both parties. Therefore, the ratio laid down in the above citations are not applicable. 14)It is an admitted fact that, respondent no.3 was driving truck, which is owned by respondent no.2 and was duly insured with respondent no. 1. Thus, I answer issue No. 2 accordingly. AS TO ISSUE NO. 3 : 15)According to claimants, deceased Ganesh was doing service in Kamal Nayan Bajaj Hospital as Nursing Staff and was getting salary of Rs. 12,000/­ p.m. To support his contention, he has examined Dr. Natasha Verma vide Exh. 37. She has deposed that, “She is Manager, (Operation HR) at Kamal Nayan Bajaj Hospital, Aurangabad. She knows Ganesh Wagh as he was serving in Nursing Staff in the hospital since September, 2014. She has filed salary certificate (Exh.38). It bears her signature. Its contents are correct. It shows that, he got Rs.11,000/­ p.m. Therefore, there is no hesitation to conclude that, he was getting of Rs.11,000/­ p.m. As I have already held that the truck driver and deceased were equally (50­50) liable for accident. Therefore, his 50% income needs to be deducted. (His monthly income was Rs. 10 11,000 ­ 5,500 = 5,500). Therefore, his net income for deciding compensation would be Rs.5,500/­ p.m. As per School Leaving Certificate, birth date of deceased is 10/12/1992 and an accident occurred on 28/03/2015. Therefore, his age would be 23 years. 16)According to claimants, deceased was just 23 years old. Therefore, 50% future prospectus may be considered. Evidence of Dr. Verma (Exh. 37) needs to be scrutinized. She has admitted that, deceased was getting stipend of Rs. 11,000/­ p.m. and not as salary. He was trainee and not permanent employee. I am of view that, as he was getting stipend and not salary, moreover, he was not permanent employee. Therefore, it would not be appropriate to grant future prospectus. Relied upon the case of National Insurance Company Ltd., Vs. Pranay Sethi and Others, Special Leave Petition (Civil) No. 25590/2014 decided on 31/10/2017 . 17)His age is 23 years, therefore, as per Sarla Verma and ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Ors. Reported in 2009 (2) T.A.C. 677 (Supreme Court ) case, the multiplier “18” would be applicable. As deceased was unmarried, therefore, there would be 50% deduction towards personal and living expenses. Considering the circumstances, I calculate the compensation as follows : 11 [MACP No.318/2015] Sr. No. Heads Calculations Rupees 1 Yearly income of deceased : Rs. 5,500 p.m. X 12 = 66,000 2 50% deduction as personal and living expenses : Rs. 66,000 – 33,000 =33,000 3 Compensation after applying multiplier of “18” : Rs. 33,000 x 18 = 5,94,000 4 Loss of Love & affection 1,00,000 5 Funeral­expenses 15,000 6 Total = 7,09,000/­ Thus, the claimants are entitled compensation of Rs. 7,09,000 /­ (Rs. Seven Lacs and Nine Thousand Only). 18) The claimants have requested to grant interest @ Rs.18% per annum. I am of the view that, the said interest would be exorbitant. Instead of that, as per Kanhsingh Vs Tukaram 2015 (2) T.A.C. 689 (Supreme Court) the interest @ Rs.9% per annum would be proper and reasonable. In view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Khenyei Vs New India Assurance Co. Ltd. (2015) 9 Supreme Court Cases 273 . The claimant can recover the compensation from the respondents jointly and severally. It is 12 a joint tortfeasors liability. Thus, I answer issue No. 3 accordingly and proceed to pass the following order:­ ORDER 1)The claim­petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs. 2)The Respondent no. 1 to 3 are held liable jointly and severally to pay the compensation. of Rs. 7,09,000/­(Rs. Seven Lacs and Nine Thousand Only) to theclaimants with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of petition, i.e. 08/05/2015, till realization of the entire payment,after deducting the NFL amount, if paid. 3)Out of awarded compensation, an amount of Rs. 4,09,000/­ (Rs.Four Lacs and Nine Thousand Only) be given to Claimant No. 1 being father. 4)Out of awarded compensation, an amount of Rs. 3,00,000/­ (Rs. Three Lacs Only) be given to Claimant No. 2 being mother. 5)Claimant nos. 3 and 4 are students, hence no separate share is allotted to them. 6)An award be drawn accordingly.

Tathe – Advocate for claimants Ex parte against Respondent Nos.1 and 2 Mr.J.K. Narayane – Advocate for Respondent No.3 ******************************************** J U D G M E N T [Delivered on 13th day of September, 2017] 1]Claimants have filed this claim petition for claiming compensation of Rs.10,00,000/­ under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act. 2]In short, the facts of claimants case can be summarized as follows :­ Claimant no.1 Komal is the wife of deceased Akash Avcharmal. Claimant no.2 Vimalbai and claimant no.3 Baban are the parents of deceased Akash Avcharmal. Claimant no.4 Akansha – minor daughter, is the daughter of claimant no.1 Komal and deceased Akash Avcharmal. Komal & ors. Vs. Johny & ors. 3 Judgment – MACP No.551/2015 3]On 13.06.2015, deceased Akash s/o Baban Avcharmal was traveling from Mitmita towards at village Gadiwat on Aurangabad to Daulatabad road via Padegaon, Aurangabad by motorcycle Kawasaki Bajaj bearing no. MH­20­CK­2893. Deceased Akash was driving the said motorcycle in a moderate speed. When he reached at Padegaon Taluka and District Aurangabad that time the offending vehicle Truck bearing no. AP­16­TB­3679 came from opposite direction and gave dash to deceased Akash / his motorcycle. The offending truck was being driven by respondent no.1 Johny Basha in a rash and negligent manner and in a very high speed. Deceased Akash met with an accident and he died on the spot. 4]After occurrence of the accident, deceased Akash was shifted to Government Medical College and Hospital (Ghati), Aurangabad where he was declared dead by the doctor. Later on, the postmortem on the dead body of deceased Akash was conducted by the concerned doctor. 5]The police authority of the police station Chhawani, Aurangabad registered an offence punishable under section 279 and 304A of the IPC vide crime no. 89/2015 against respondent 4 no.1 / truck driver of the offending vehicle. Spot and inquest panchanamas were drawn by the police authority. 6]Deceased Akash was a healthy person and he was earning hand / Karta for his family, doing Meson work, earning Rs.400/­ per day. Further, he was doing the work of petty contracts, getting income of Rs.5,000/­ per month. Deceased Akash succumbed to the injuries on the spot. He was survived by his wife – claimant no.1, parents – claimant nos.2 and 3 and her minor daughter – claimant no.4. On the date of accident the wife of deceased Akash was pregnant of eight months, as such claimant no.4 is added as a legal heir of deceased Akash. All the claimants have lost the Karta of their family. They deprived from love and affection of deceased Akash due to sudden death. All the claimants were dependent upon deceased Akash. 7]At the time of death deceased Akash was 21 years old. The offending vehicle was owned by respondent no.2, which is validly insured with respondent no.3 vide policy no. 560600/31/ 14/6300002807 w.e.f.31.07.2014 to 30.07.2015. Accordingly, al the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation of Rs.10,000/­ with interest, claimants lastly submitted to allow this petition with costs. Komal & ors. Vs. Johny & ors. 5 Judgment – MACP No.551/2015 8]Respondent Nos.1 and 2 failed to appear despite service of notice as case is proceeded exparte against them vide order below exh.1. Respondent No.3 appeared and filed its say and written statement vide exh.13 and resisted the entire claim of the claimants including earning, age of deceased Akash. Insurance company has denied the liability to pay the compensation. The claim of the claimants is exorbitant and excessive and not admissible in the eye of law. The driver of the offending vehicle was not having valid and effective motor driving licence on the date of accident. It is admitted that, the offending truck bearing no. AP­16­TB­3679 as involved in an accident was insured with this respondent no.3 for the period from 31.07.2014 to 30.07.2015. Claimants have not impleaded the owner of motorcycle and its insurance company. Lastly, respondent no.3 – insurance company had resisted, challenged the entire claim and lastly submitted to dismiss the claim. 9]Considering the rival contentions of both parties / pleading, I have framed issues at exh.23 which are being reproduce as follows, I record my findings with reasons thereon as follows :­ 6 ISSUES FINDINGS 1]Whether due to rash and negligent driving of the motor vehicle bearing registration No. AP­16­TB­3679 the accident occurred and as a consequence thereof, deceased Akash s/o Baban Avcharmal died ?In the affirmative. 2]Whether claimants are entitled to get compensation ? If yes, what should be the quantum ? Yes, Rs.11,54,000/­. 3]Who is liable to pay compensation ? As per final order . 4]What order and award ? As per final order. R E A S O N S 10]In order to prove their claim, claimants have examined claimant no.3 – Baban s/o Sopanrao Avcharmal as CW1 vide exh.25. Claimants have relied on the documentary evidence, these are (1) AA form exh.27 (2) true copy of FIR exh.28 (3) driving licence of respondent no.1 exh.29 (4) permit of vehicle exh.30 (5) insurance policy of offending vehicle exh.31 (6) a copy of letter exh.32 (7) copy of inquest panchnama exh.33 (8) copy of provisional postmortem report exh.34 (9) spot panchanama exh.35.

These are copy of chargesheet exh.37, copy of complaint exh.38, copy of supurtnama exh.39, copy of statements of witnesses Sudhakar, Kulusu, Shubham and Baban exhs.40 to 43 respectively, copy of postmortem report exh.44, copy of accident report exh.45, copy of accident report exh.46. These documents are also admitted by the respondent no.3 – insurance company. Claimants have closed their evidence exh.47. Then respondent no.3 – insurance company also filed purshis vide exh.48 stating therein that, it does not want to lead any evidence. In the circumstances there is no evidence of respondents on record in rebuttal of evidence of claimants in this case. 11]Heard learned counsel Shri N.B. Tathe for the claimants and Shri J.K. Narayane for respondent no.3 – insurance company at length. 12]In the instant case learned counsel for the claimants Shri Tathe relied on following rulings in support of his claim, these are :­ 1}Smt.Neeta w/o Kallappa Kadolkar and others Vs. The Divisional Manager, MSRTC, Kolhapur 2015(1) T.A.C. 340 (S.C.) 8 2}Ramchandrappa Vs. Manager, Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Company Ltd. 2011(4) T.A.C. 1 (S.C.). 13]Learned counsel Shri J.K. Narayane for Respondent No.3 – insurance company relied on the ruling – in the matter of Karnailsingh and another Vs. Rattan Lal Gujjar and others 2016(3) T.A.C. 397 (H.P.). AS TO ISSUE NO.1 :­ 14]Admittedly, respondent no.3 was the driver of offending vehicle, respondent no.2 Kolusu Mohan Rao was the owner of the offending vehicle and said offending vehicle was validly insured with respondent no.3 vide insurance policy exh.31. 15]Now the dispute / issue remains in respect of rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by the driver / respondent no.1. 16]It is not in dispute that, the vehicular accident has taken place and the offending vehicle was driven by respondent no.1, owned by respondent no.2 bearing offending vehicle no. AP­ 16­TB­3679. Furthermore, it is not in dispute that, deceased Akash Komal & ors. Vs. Johny & ors. 9 Judgment – MACP No.551/2015 Avcharmal had expired on the spot when he met with an accident on the date of accident i.e. on 13.06.2015 on Aurangabad to Daulatabad road at Padegaon, opposite Hotel Baghicha within the jurisdiction of police station Chhawani. Furthermore, it is also not in dispute that, the offending vehicle bearing Truck No. AP­16­TB­ 3679 was insured on the date of accident vide policy exh.31 for the period from 31.07.2014 to 30.07.2015. 17]From the oral evidence as well as documentary evidence as led by the claimants and particularly from the oral evidence of PW1 Baban Sopanrao Avcharmal vide exh.25, AA form exh.27, true copy of FIR exh.28, true copy of inquest panchanama exh.33, provisional postmortem report exh.34 and spot panchanama exh.35, chargesheet exh.37, copy of complaint exh.38, copies of statements of witnesses Sudhakar, Kulusu, Shubhan and Baban at exhs.40 to 43 respectively and postmortem report exh.44, accident reports exhs.45 and 46, it goes to prove that, the accident had occurred on 13.06.2015 on Aurangabad to Daulatabad road, opposite Hotel Baghicha and deceased Akash Baban Avcharmal had died on the spot. 18]Further, it is proved that, the offending vehicle – Truck bearing No. AP­16­TB­3679 was driven by Respondent No.1 10 Johny Basha in a rash and negligent manner, as such he has been chargesheeted vide chargesheet exh.37, for the offence punishable under section 304­A, 279 of the IPC. 19]Further, it is pertinent to note that, Respondent No.1 – driver of the offending vehicle as well as the owner of offending vehicle – Respondent No.2 did not appear in this case, as such case proceeded exparte against them. When respondent no.1 driver of the offending vehicle did not appear, adverse inference can be drawn against him that, he had driven offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. 20]From this, it goes to prove that, the driver – Respondent No.1 – Johny Basha was rash and negligent while driving the offending vehicle. 21]Furthermore, there is no evidence led by the respondents in rebuttal to challenge the case of the claimants. From oral and documentary evidence as led by the claimants, it is proved that, respondent no.1 was rash and negligent while driving the vehicle due to this deceased Akash Avcharmal had expired on the date of accident. Komal & ors. Vs. Johny & ors. 11 Judgment – MACP No.551/2015 22]In such circumstances it is proved that, due to rash and negligent driving of the motor vehicle no. AP­16­TB­3679 as driven by respondent no.1, the accident occurred as consequence thereof the deceased Akash Avcharmal had expired in an accident. Hence, issue no.1 is proved at all and I answer issue no.1 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO.2 :­ 23]As the deceased has expired in motor vehicle accident due to rash and negligent driving driven by respondent no.1 in respect of the offending vehicle as aforesaid. Hence, the claimants being the legal heirs / dependents are entitled to get the compensation under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act. 24]Just to assess the compensation it should be considered the age, income of the deceased coupled with multiplier applicable to this case just to quantify the claim of the claimants. 25]Claimants have come up with a case that, deceased Akash Avcharmal was 21 years old on the date of accident. However, there is no proof about the date of birth of deceased 12 Akash Avcharmal on record. But, from the police case papers, particularly postmortem report of deceased Akash Avcharmal vide exh.34, in the inquest panchanama vide exh.33, the age of the deceased as 21 years can be considered. Considering the age of the deceased as 21 years the multiplier as per the case of Smt.Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another reported in 2009(2) T.A.C. 677(S.C.) multiplier of 18 can be applicable in this case. 26]Now the issue is in respect of the income of the deceased. The claimants have come up with a specific case that, deceased Akash Avcharmal was Meson by profession and was getting income of Rs.10,000/­ per month from the Meson and construction business. But, in the instant case except oral evidence of the claimant no.3 Baban Sopanrao Avcharmal as CW1 (father of the deceased) there is no cogent, reliable and trustworthy evidence i.e. documentary evidence to prove that, the income of deceased Akash Avcharmal was Rs.10,000/­ per month. Hence, in absence of documentary evidence, the notional income of Rs.4,500/­ can be considered as observed by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Ramchandrappa Vs. Manager, Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Co.Ltd. reported in 2011(4) T.A.C. 1 (S.C.) . Komal & ors. Vs. Johny & ors. 13 Judgment – MACP No.551/2015 27]Learned counsel Shri Narayane for respondent no.3 – insurance company has vehemently argued that, in absence of proof of income of deceased Akash Avcharmal, Rs.4,500/­ the notional income of the deceased can be considered. Taking his income as a labourer, deceased would have been earning Rs.4,500/­ as submitted by learned counsel Shri Narayane. He relied on the ruling of Hon'ble Himachal Pradesh in case of Karnailsingh and another cited supra, wherein it is observed that, Rs.4,500/­ can be considered as a income of the deceased as a labourer. 28]Moreover, in case of Ramchandrappa cited supra as relied by claimants side Hon'ble Supreme Court also considered the income of the deceased as Rs.4,500/­ in absence of any other evidence in respect of the income of the deceased, Rs.4,500/­ can be accepted as a monthly income / income. Hence, I hold that, the income of the deceased as Rs.4,500/­ per month can be considered. 29]Moreover, the claimants being four in numbers, as per the principle of Sarla Verma's case cited supra, 1/4th deduction from the notional income of deceased is required to be deducted 14 for his personal and living expenses. Further, as the income of the deceased was not fixed and self­employed, therefore, I declined to grant future prospects. 30]Therefore, claimants are entitled to loss of dependency as follows :­ Notional income ­Rs.4,500/­ Deduction 1/4th ­Rs.1,125/­ ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­ Total Rs.3,375/­ Rs.3,375/­ pm x 12 months = Rs.40,500/­ per annum Rs.40,500/­ pa x 18 multiplier = Rs.7,29,000/­. Therefore, the loss of dependency comes to Rs.7,29,000/­. 31]Further, as per the ratio laid down in the case of Smt.Neeta w/o Kallappa Kadolkar cited supra, the claimants are also entitled for non­pecuniary damages under various heads as under :­ 1]Loss of love and affection (daughter – claimant no.4)Rs.1,00,000/­ 2]Loss of love and affection (parents – claimant nos.2&3 – Rs.50,000/­ each.)Rs.1,00,000/­ 3]Loss of consortium (claimant no.1 – wife)Rs.1,00,000/­ 4]Loss of estate Rs.1,00,000/­ 5]Funeral expenses Rs.25,000/­ Total Rs.4,25,000/­ Komal & ors. Vs. Johny & ors. 15 Judgment – MACP No.551/2015 In short, the claimants are entitled to get in all Rs.7,29,000/­ + Rs.4,25,000/­ = Rs.11,54,000/­. 32]The claimants have claimed interest @ 12% on the compensation amount. But, as per the ratio laid down in the case of Smt.Neeta cited supra, I award interest @ 9% per annum on the compensation amount. Hence, I answer issue no.2 accordingly. AS TO ISSUE NO.3 AND 4:­ 33]So far as the contributory negligence is concerned, there is absolutely no circumstance or evidence brought on record by the respondents to show that there was a contributory negligence or sole negligence on the part of the deceased. The accident occurred on 13.06.2015. The insurance policy valid for a period between 31.07.2014 and 30.07.2015. It covers the accident. 34]Therefore, in such circumstances the respondent no.1 being the driver, respondent no.2 being owner and respondent no.3 being the insurance company of offending vehicle i.e. Truck bearing No. AP­16­TB­3679 are liable to pay the compensation 16 jointly and severally to the claimants with interest thereon @ 9% p.a. Hence, I answer issue no.3 accordingly and proceed to pass the following order :­ ORDER 1]The petition is allowed with proportionate costs. 2]Respondent Nos.1 to 3 jointly and severally do pay and deposit the compensation amount in this case within a period of two months from the date of this order an amount of Rs.11,54,000/­ (Rupees Eleven Lacs Fifty Four Thousand only) towards compensation together with interest thereon @ 9% per annum, from the date of filing of this petition till its realization, including NFL amount of Rs.50,000/­. 3]After depositing the amount, it be apportioned as under :­ Claimant No.1 ­Rs.4,15,000/­ Claimant No.2 ­Rs.2,62,000/­ Claimant No.3 ­Rs.1,62,000/­ Claimant No.4 ­Rs.3,15,000/­. Out of amount of claimant no.1, an amount of Rs.2,00,000/­ be invested in fixed deposit scheme of any nationalized bank for a period of three years. Claimant No.4 being minor, her amount be invested in fixed deposit scheme of any nationalized bank till she attain age of majority or fixation of her marriage, whichever is earlier. Rest Komal & ors. Vs. Johny & ors. 17 Judgment – MACP No.551/2015 of the amounts be given to the claimants by account payee cheques. 4]Claimants is directed to pay the deficit requisite court fees immediately. 5]After payment of deficit court fees, award be drawn accordingly.

Narayane – Advocate for Respondent No.3 ******************************************** J U D G M E N T [Delivered on 13th day of September, 2017] 1]Claimants have filed this claim petition for claiming compensation of Rs.10,00,000/­ under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act. 2]In short, the facts of claimants case can be summarized as follows :­ Claimant no.1 Komal is the wife of deceased Akash Avcharmal. Claimant no.2 Vimalbai and claimant no.3 Baban are the parents of deceased Akash Avcharmal. Claimant no.4 Akansha – minor daughter, is the daughter of claimant no.1 Komal and deceased Akash Avcharmal. Komal & ors. Vs. Johny & ors. 3 Judgment – MACP No.551/2015 3]On 13.06.2015, deceased Akash s/o Baban Avcharmal was traveling from Mitmita towards at village Gadiwat on Aurangabad to Daulatabad road via Padegaon, Aurangabad by motorcycle Kawasaki Bajaj bearing no. MH­20­CK­2893. Deceased Akash was driving the said motorcycle in a moderate speed. When he reached at Padegaon Taluka and District Aurangabad that time the offending vehicle Truck bearing no. AP­16­TB­3679 came from opposite direction and gave dash to deceased Akash / his motorcycle. The offending truck was being driven by respondent no.1 Johny Basha in a rash and negligent manner and in a very high speed. Deceased Akash met with an accident and he died on the spot. 4]After occurrence of the accident, deceased Akash was shifted to Government Medical College and Hospital (Ghati), Aurangabad where he was declared dead by the doctor. Later on, the postmortem on the dead body of deceased Akash was conducted by the concerned doctor. 5]The police authority of the police station Chhawani, Aurangabad registered an offence punishable under section 279 and 304A of the IPC vide crime no. 89/2015 against respondent 4 no.1 / truck driver of the offending vehicle. Spot and inquest panchanamas were drawn by the police authority. 6]Deceased Akash was a healthy person and he was earning hand / Karta for his family, doing Meson work, earning Rs.400/­ per day. Further, he was doing the work of petty contracts, getting income of Rs.5,000/­ per month. Deceased Akash succumbed to the injuries on the spot. He was survived by his wife – claimant no.1, parents – claimant nos.2 and 3 and her minor daughter – claimant no.4. On the date of accident the wife of deceased Akash was pregnant of eight months, as such claimant no.4 is added as a legal heir of deceased Akash. All the claimants have lost the Karta of their family. They deprived from love and affection of deceased Akash due to sudden death. All the claimants were dependent upon deceased Akash. 7]At the time of death deceased Akash was 21 years old. The offending vehicle was owned by respondent no.2, which is validly insured with respondent no.3 vide policy no. 560600/31/ 14/6300002807 w.e.f.31.07.2014 to 30.07.2015. Accordingly, al the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation of Rs.10,000/­ with interest, claimants lastly submitted to allow this petition with costs. Komal & ors. Vs. Johny & ors. 5 Judgment – MACP No.551/2015 8]Respondent Nos.1 and 2 failed to appear despite service of notice as case is proceeded exparte against them vide order below exh.1. Respondent No.3 appeared and filed its say and written statement vide exh.13 and resisted the entire claim of the claimants including earning, age of deceased Akash. Insurance company has denied the liability to pay the compensation. The claim of the claimants is exorbitant and excessive and not admissible in the eye of law. The driver of the offending vehicle was not having valid and effective motor driving licence on the date of accident. It is admitted that, the offending truck bearing no. AP­16­TB­3679 as involved in an accident was insured with this respondent no.3 for the period from 31.07.2014 to 30.07.2015. Claimants have not impleaded the owner of motorcycle and its insurance company. Lastly, respondent no.3 – insurance company had resisted, challenged the entire claim and lastly submitted to dismiss the claim. 9]Considering the rival contentions of both parties / pleading, I have framed issues at exh.23 which are being reproduce as follows, I record my findings with reasons thereon as follows :­ 6 ISSUES FINDINGS 1]Whether due to rash and negligent driving of the motor vehicle bearing registration No. AP­16­TB­3679 the accident occurred and as a consequence thereof, deceased Akash s/o Baban Avcharmal died ?In the affirmative. 2]Whether claimants are entitled to get compensation ?

In the circumstances there is no evidence of respondents on record in rebuttal of evidence of claimants in this case. 11]Heard learned counsel Shri N.B. Tathe for the claimants and Shri J.K. Narayane for respondent no.3 – insurance company at length. 12]In the instant case learned counsel for the claimants Shri Tathe relied on following rulings in support of his claim, these are :­ 1}Smt.Neeta w/o Kallappa Kadolkar and others Vs. The Divisional Manager, MSRTC, Kolhapur 2015(1) T.A.C. 340 (S.C.) 8 2}Ramchandrappa Vs. Manager, Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Company Ltd. 2011(4) T.A.C. 1 (S.C.). 13]Learned counsel Shri J.K. Narayane for Respondent No.3 – insurance company relied on the ruling – in the matter of Karnailsingh and another Vs. Rattan Lal Gujjar and others 2016(3) T.A.C. 397 (H.P.). AS TO ISSUE NO.1 :­ 14]Admittedly, respondent no.3 was the driver of offending vehicle, respondent no.2 Kolusu Mohan Rao was the owner of the offending vehicle and said offending vehicle was validly insured with respondent no.3 vide insurance policy exh.31. 15]Now the dispute / issue remains in respect of rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by the driver / respondent no.1. 16]It is not in dispute that, the vehicular accident has taken place and the offending vehicle was driven by respondent no.1, owned by respondent no.2 bearing offending vehicle no. AP­ 16­TB­3679. Furthermore, it is not in dispute that, deceased Akash Komal & ors. Vs. Johny & ors. 9 Judgment – MACP No.551/2015 Avcharmal had expired on the spot when he met with an accident on the date of accident i.e. on 13.06.2015 on Aurangabad to Daulatabad road at Padegaon, opposite Hotel Baghicha within the jurisdiction of police station Chhawani. Furthermore, it is also not in dispute that, the offending vehicle bearing Truck No. AP­16­TB­ 3679 was insured on the date of accident vide policy exh.31 for the period from 31.07.2014 to 30.07.2015. 17]From the oral evidence as well as documentary evidence as led by the claimants and particularly from the oral evidence of PW1 Baban Sopanrao Avcharmal vide exh.25, AA form exh.27, true copy of FIR exh.28, true copy of inquest panchanama exh.33, provisional postmortem report exh.34 and spot panchanama exh.35, chargesheet exh.37, copy of complaint exh.38, copies of statements of witnesses Sudhakar, Kulusu, Shubhan and Baban at exhs.40 to 43 respectively and postmortem report exh.44, accident reports exhs.45 and 46, it goes to prove that, the accident had occurred on 13.06.2015 on Aurangabad to Daulatabad road, opposite Hotel Baghicha and deceased Akash Baban Avcharmal had died on the spot. 18]Further, it is proved that, the offending vehicle – Truck bearing No. AP­16­TB­3679 was driven by Respondent No.1 10 Johny Basha in a rash and negligent manner, as such he has been chargesheeted vide chargesheet exh.37, for the offence punishable under section 304­A, 279 of the IPC. 19]Further, it is pertinent to note that, Respondent No.1 – driver of the offending vehicle as well as the owner of offending vehicle – Respondent No.2 did not appear in this case, as such case proceeded exparte against them. When respondent no.1 driver of the offending vehicle did not appear, adverse inference can be drawn against him that, he had driven offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. 20]From this, it goes to prove that, the driver – Respondent No.1 – Johny Basha was rash and negligent while driving the offending vehicle. 21]Furthermore, there is no evidence led by the respondents in rebuttal to challenge the case of the claimants. From oral and documentary evidence as led by the claimants, it is proved that, respondent no.1 was rash and negligent while driving the vehicle due to this deceased Akash Avcharmal had expired on the date of accident. Komal & ors. Vs. Johny & ors. 11 Judgment – MACP No.551/2015 22]In such circumstances it is proved that, due to rash and negligent driving of the motor vehicle no. AP­16­TB­3679 as driven by respondent no.1, the accident occurred as consequence thereof the deceased Akash Avcharmal had expired in an accident. Hence, issue no.1 is proved at all and I answer issue no.1 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO.2 :­ 23]As the deceased has expired in motor vehicle accident due to rash and negligent driving driven by respondent no.1 in respect of the offending vehicle as aforesaid. Hence, the claimants being the legal heirs / dependents are entitled to get the compensation under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act. 24]Just to assess the compensation it should be considered the age, income of the deceased coupled with multiplier applicable to this case just to quantify the claim of the claimants. 25]Claimants have come up with a case that, deceased Akash Avcharmal was 21 years old on the date of accident. However, there is no proof about the date of birth of deceased 12 Akash Avcharmal on record. But, from the police case papers, particularly postmortem report of deceased Akash Avcharmal vide exh.34, in the inquest panchanama vide exh.33, the age of the deceased as 21 years can be considered. Considering the age of the deceased as 21 years the multiplier as per the case of Smt.Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another reported in 2009(2) T.A.C. 677(S.C.) multiplier of 18 can be applicable in this case. 26]Now the issue is in respect of the income of the deceased. The claimants have come up with a specific case that, deceased Akash Avcharmal was Meson by profession and was getting income of Rs.10,000/­ per month from the Meson and construction business. But, in the instant case except oral evidence of the claimant no.3 Baban Sopanrao Avcharmal as CW1 (father of the deceased) there is no cogent, reliable and trustworthy evidence i.e. documentary evidence to prove that, the income of deceased Akash Avcharmal was Rs.10,000/­ per month. Hence, in absence of documentary evidence, the notional income of Rs.4,500/­ can be considered as observed by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Ramchandrappa Vs. Manager, Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Co.Ltd. reported in 2011(4) T.A.C. 1 (S.C.) . Komal & ors. Vs. Johny & ors. 13 Judgment – MACP No.551/2015 27]Learned counsel Shri Narayane for respondent no.3 – insurance company has vehemently argued that, in absence of proof of income of deceased Akash Avcharmal, Rs.4,500/­ the notional income of the deceased can be considered. Taking his income as a labourer, deceased would have been earning Rs.4,500/­ as submitted by learned counsel Shri Narayane. He relied on the ruling of Hon'ble Himachal Pradesh in case of Karnailsingh and another cited supra, wherein it is observed that, Rs.4,500/­ can be considered as a income of the deceased as a labourer. 28]Moreover, in case of Ramchandrappa cited supra as relied by claimants side Hon'ble Supreme Court also considered the income of the deceased as Rs.4,500/­ in absence of any other evidence in respect of the income of the deceased, Rs.4,500/­ can be accepted as a monthly income / income. Hence, I hold that, the income of the deceased as Rs.4,500/­ per month can be considered. 29]Moreover, the claimants being four in numbers, as per the principle of Sarla Verma's case cited supra, 1/4th deduction from the notional income of deceased is required to be deducted 14 for his personal and living expenses. Further, as the income of the deceased was not fixed and self­employed, therefore, I declined to grant future prospects. 30]Therefore, claimants are entitled to loss of dependency as follows :­ Notional income ­Rs.4,500/­ Deduction 1/4th ­Rs.1,125/­ ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­ Total Rs.3,375/­ Rs.3,375/­ pm x 12 months = Rs.40,500/­ per annum Rs.40,500/­ pa x 18 multiplier = Rs.7,29,000/­. Therefore, the loss of dependency comes to Rs.7,29,000/­. 31]Further, as per the ratio laid down in the case of Smt.Neeta w/o Kallappa Kadolkar cited supra, the claimants are also entitled for non­pecuniary damages under various heads as under :­ 1]Loss of love and affection (daughter – claimant no.4)Rs.1,00,000/­ 2]Loss of love and affection (parents – claimant nos.2&3 – Rs.50,000/­ each.)Rs.1,00,000/­ 3]Loss of consortium (claimant no.1 – wife)Rs.1,00,000/­ 4]Loss of estate Rs.1,00,000/­ 5]Funeral expenses Rs.25,000/­ Total Rs.4,25,000/­ Komal & ors. Vs. Johny & ors. 15 Judgment – MACP No.551/2015 In short, the claimants are entitled to get in all Rs.7,29,000/­ + Rs.4,25,000/­ = Rs.11,54,000/­. 32]The claimants have claimed interest @ 12% on the compensation amount. But, as per the ratio laid down in the case of Smt.Neeta cited supra, I award interest @ 9% per annum on the compensation amount. Hence, I answer issue no.2 accordingly. AS TO ISSUE NO.3 AND 4:­ 33]So far as the contributory negligence is concerned, there is absolutely no circumstance or evidence brought on record by the respondents to show that there was a contributory negligence or sole negligence on the part of the deceased. The accident occurred on 13.06.2015. The insurance policy valid for a period between 31.07.2014 and 30.07.2015. It covers the accident. 34]Therefore, in such circumstances the respondent no.1 being the driver, respondent no.2 being owner and respondent no.3 being the insurance company of offending vehicle i.e. Truck bearing No. AP­16­TB­3679 are liable to pay the compensation 16 jointly and severally to the claimants with interest thereon @ 9% p.a. Hence, I answer issue no.3 accordingly and proceed to pass the following order :­ ORDER 1]The petition is allowed with proportionate costs. 2]Respondent Nos.1 to 3 jointly and severally do pay and deposit the compensation amount in this case within a period of two months from the date of this order an amount of Rs.11,54,000/­ (Rupees Eleven Lacs Fifty Four Thousand only) towards compensation together with interest thereon @ 9% per annum, from the date of filing of this petition till its realization, including NFL amount of Rs.50,000/­. 3]After depositing the amount, it be apportioned as under :­ Claimant No.1 ­Rs.4,15,000/­ Claimant No.2 ­Rs.2,62,000/­ Claimant No.3 ­Rs.1,62,000/­ Claimant No.4 ­Rs.3,15,000/­. Out of amount of claimant no.1, an amount of Rs.2,00,000/­ be invested in fixed deposit scheme of any nationalized bank for a period of three years. Claimant No.4 being minor, her amount be invested in fixed deposit scheme of any nationalized bank till she attain age of majority or fixation of her marriage, whichever is earlier. Rest Komal & ors. Vs. Johny & ors. 17 Judgment – MACP No.551/2015 of the amounts be given to the claimants by account payee cheques. 4]Claimants is directed to pay the deficit requisite court fees immediately. 5]After payment of deficit court fees, award be drawn accordingly.

Mahajan, Advocate for respondent No.1 Shri K.S. Wagh, Advocate for respondent No.2 Exparte against respondent No.3 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ JUDGMENT (Delivered on : 24.07.2017) 1.The present petition is filed under Section 166 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 seeking compensation of Rs.20,00,000/- due to accidental death of Ashok Bhagaji Dandge in motor vehicular accident. 2.Brief facts, giving rise to this petition, are as under :- On 29.09.2014 at about 07.35 p.m. deceased Ashok Dandge was walking towards Mill Corner. When he came in front of Central Bus stand, one TVS motorcycle bearing registration No. MH-20-CZ-7422 (hereinafter referred to as 'the offending vehicle') driven by respondent No. 3 in very high speed, in rash and 3 M.A.C.P. No.218/2015 [Judgment] negligent manner and gave dash to Ashok Dandge. In said accident, Ashok fell down and sustained serious injury on his head and on several parts of body. 3.Immediately after the accident, injured Ashok was shifted to Government Medical College and Hospital, Aurangabad for medical treatment. Concerned doctors attended him and after check-up declared him as dead. Postmortem was conducted on the dead body of deceased Ashok. 4.After the accident, report was lodged in Kranti chowk police station, Aurangabad. Concerned police investigated into the matter and registered crime bearing No.I-455/2014 for the offences punishable under Section 304-A, 279,337 of The Indian Penal Code and under Section 134/177 and 129/177 of The Motor Vehicles Act against driver of the offending vehicle. 5.Deceased Ashokh Dandge was 55 years old at the time of the accident. He was doing business of fruit selling and was earning Rs.15,000/- per month. Claimant No.1 is widow, claimant Nos.2 and 3 are sons of the deceased who are taking education. Claimant No.4 is unmarried daughter of the deceased. The claimants were fully dependent upon the earnings of the deceased. 4 M.A.C.P. No.218/2015 [Judgment] But, due to untimely death of Ashok, the claimants are suffering from financial hardship. 6.At the time of the accident, the offending vehicle was owned by respondent No.2, driven by respondent No.3 and it was was validly insured with respondent No. 1-insured company. The claimants claimed compensation of Rs.20,00,000/- alongwith interest @18% p.a. from respondent Nos.1 to 3 jointly and severally. 7.Respondent No. 1 has filed its written statement/ say at Exh. 15 and denied the contents of the petition. It is denied that, the offending vehicle was involved in the alleged accident and it was being driven in a rash and negligent manner at the time of the accident. It is denied that, deceased Ashok was 55 years of age and was earning Rs.15,000/- per month from the business of fruit selling at the time of the accident. Respondent No.3 is not responsible for the present accident. Registration of crime at Kranti chowk police station, Aurangabad against respondent No.3 is denied by this respondent. It is submitted that, deceased Ashok was himself crossing the road without following traffic rules. Therefore, the deceased was negligent and responsible for said accident. The 5 M.A.C.P. No.218/2015 [Judgment] driver of the offending vehicle i.e. respondent No.3 was not holding valid driving license at the time of the accident. Therefore, there is breach of terms of insurance policy. Hence, this respondent is not liable to pay compensation to the claimants. Lastly, it is prayed to dismiss the petition against it. 8.Respondent No.2 resisted the claim by filing his written statement/say at Exh. 28. It is denied that, the accident took place on 29.09.2014 at about 7.35 p.m. on road at Central Bus Stand, Aurangabad. It is denied that, after the accident, report has been lodged in Kranti chowk police station, Aurangabad. It is also denied that, crime came to be registered at concerned police station against driver of the offending vehicle. It is also denied that, the deceased was 55 years old and was earning Rs.15,000/- per month at the time of the accident. It is denied that, the claimants were dependent on the income of the deceased. It is submitted that, the accident occurred due to negligence of the deceased himself. There is no fault on the part of respondent No.2 for the accident. Lastly, it is prayed to dismiss the petition against him. 9.The petition proceeded exparte against respondent No.3. 6 M.A.C.P. No.218/2015 [Judgment] 10.Following issues are framed at Exh. 29. I record my findings thereon for the reasons stated thereafter. ISSUES FINDINGS 1.Whether due to rash and negligent driving of TVS Start City Motorcycle bearing registration No. MH-20-CZ-7422 the accident occurred and as a consequence thereof Ashok Bhagaji Dandge died ?In the affirmative 2.Whether the claimants are entitled to get compensation ? If yes, what should be the quantum ?In the affirmative as per final order 3.Who is liable to pay the compensation ? Respondent Nos.1 to 3 jointly and severally 4.What award ? As per final order REASONS 11.In order to substantiate the claim petition, on behalf of the claimants, claimant No.1 Shashikala wd/o Ashok Dandge filed her affidavit of examination-in-chief at Exh. 31. Apart from this, the claimants have filed on record certified copies of Postmortem report (Exh.37), Inquest panchnama (Exh.38), Spot panchnama (Exh.39), Memorandum of postmortem (Exh.40), Seizure panchnama (Exh.41), FIR (Exh.42), Accident information report 7 M.A.C.P. No.218/2015 [Judgment] (Exh.43), Postmortem cum provisional cause of death certificate (Exh.44), Vehicle information form (Exh.45). 12.Respondent No.1 has examined its witness by name, Milind Arjunrao Sasane at Exh.50. In addition to this, respondent No.1 has filed on record Authority letter of this witness(Exh.51), Extract of driving license of Kailash Dabhade (Exh.52), Extract of driving license of respondent No.3(Exh.53), Vehicle particulars of the offending vehicle (Exh.54) and closed their evidence vide pursis at Exh.55. AS TO ISSUE NO.1 :- 13. Affidavit of examination-in-chief of claimant No.1 Shashikala wd/o Ashok Dandge is replica of the claim petition. During her cross-examination by Advocate for respondent Nos.1 and 2, she denied all adverse suggestions. Evidence of this witness on the point of the accident is not refuted by the respondents during her cross-examination. FIR is lodged against respondent No.3 for rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle. As per spot panchnama (Exh.39), the place of accident is on the road in front of Central Bus Stand, Aurangabad. It further shows that, on 8 M.A.C.P. No.218/2015 [Judgment] 28.09.2014, in evening hours, when deceased Ashok Dandge after selling fruits was crossing the road, at that time, the offending vehicle came from Mill Corner in a rash and negligent manner and gave dash to Ashok Dandge. Sketch of the spot also supports occurrence of the accident in the fashion as alleged. Further, respondent No.1 has not adduced any rebuttal evidence. Registration of crime against driver of offending vehicle prima facie shows his negligence. Perusal of record shows that, the concerned driver of the offending vehicle has not challenged the charges levelled against him. So also, he did not step into the witness box to prove his innocence. The police papers filed on record are not denied by the respondents. 14.Postmortem report (Exh.40) shows that, deceased Ashok Dandge died on 29.09.2014 i.e. on the date of the accident, due to “head injury.” In the light of above discussion, it is proved that, due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle, the accident occurred and in said accident Ashok Bhagaji Dandge died. Hence, I answer issue No.1 accordingly in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NOs. 2 & 3 :- 15.Claimant No.1 is widow, claimant Nos. 2 and 3 are 9 M.A.C.P. No.218/2015 [Judgment] sons and claimant No.4 is daughter of deceased Ashok Dandge. There is no specific income of the claimants on record. Claimant No.1 during her cross-examination deposed that, claimant Nos. 2 and 3 do no work. However, she admitted that, marriage of claimant No.4 took place after the accident. Therefore, claimant No.4 being married daughter will not be dependent on the income of the deceased. Hence, claimant Nos. 1 to 3, being dependents, are entitled to get compensation on account of accidental death of Ashok Bhagaji Dandge. 16. On the point of income of the deceased, it is contended in the claim petition that, the deceased was selling fruits and therefrom he was getting income of Rs.15,000/- per month. In affidavit of evidence, it is stated that, the deceased was earning Rs.15,000/- to 18,000/- per month from fruit selling. However, the claimants have not placed on record any document, nor examined any witness to show nature of work of the deceased and his monthly income of the deceased as Rs.15,000/- per month. In these circumstances, it would be just and proper to take notional income of the deceased. Considering the period of accident as well as rates 10 M.A.C.P. No.218/2015 [Judgment] of wages prevailant at that time, notional income of the deceased is taken as Rs.4,500/- per month. 17.There are three dependents on the income of the deceased. Therefore, 1/3rd of monthly income of the deceased towards his personal expenses, should be deducted. After said deduction, loss of dependency would be Rs.3,000/- per month. Annual loss of dependency would be Rs.36,000/- (Rs.3,000 x 12). 18.The claimants have contended in their petition age of the deceased as 55 years at the time of the accident. The claimants have not filed on record any document to show exact age of the deceased. On postmortem report, age of the deceased is shown as 55 years. Therefore, it is held that, deceased Ashok Bhagaji Dandge was 55 years of age at the time of the accident. As per ratio laid down in Sarla Verma & Ors. vs. Delhi Transport Corporation & Anr., 2009 ACJ 1298, multiplier of 11 will have to be taken. Thus, total amount of compensation comes to Rs.3,96,000/- (Rs.36,000 x 11). 19.Apart from this, claimant No.1 is entitled to Rs.1,00,000/-for loss of consortium, claimant Nos.2, 3 and 4 are 11 M.A.C.P. No.218/2015 [Judgment] entitled to Rs.1,00,000/- for loss of love and affection and the claimants are entitled to Rs.25,000/- for funeral expenses. Thus, the claimants are entitled to total amount of compensation of Rs. 6,21,000/- on all counts. 20.Respondent No.1 has examined its witness Milind Arjunrao Sasane at Exh.50 in order to prove breach of policy. However, this witness during his examination-in-chief itself deposed after going through extract of driving license of respondent No.3 (Exh.53) that, respondent No.3 was having valid driving license on the date of accident i.e. on 29.09.2014. He admitted during his cross-examination that, the offending vehicle was insured on the date of accident. Therefore, it is held that, there is no breach of terms and conditions of insurance policy. 21. All the police papers on record go to show that, the offending vehicle was validly insured with respondent No.1, owned by respondent No.2 and being driven by respondent No.3 at the time of the accident. Therefore, respondent Nos. 1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the claimants. Hence, I answer Issue Nos.2 and 3 accordingly as mentioned 12 M.A.C.P. No.218/2015 [Judgment] against it and in answer to issue No.4, pass following order :- ORDER The Petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs as under :- 1]Respondent Nos. 1 to 3 jointly and severally do pay Rs.6,21,000/- (Rs.

Mr A.T. Bobade, Advocate for Claimant. Mr S.S. Thite, Advocate for Respondent Nos.1 & 2 Mr A.B. Pachode, Advocate for Respondent No. 3 ....................................................................................................... J U D G M E N T (Delivered in open court on 01/02/2018) This petition is filed by the claimant for grant of compensation of Rs.7,00,000/­ under Section 166 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. 2)Claimant's case in nutshell is as under :­ She has alleged that, an accident took place on 9/8/2014 at about 5.00 p.m. at Aurangabad ­Paithan road in front of Bus Stop of Sant Paul High School. At the time of an accident, Datta Bobade was travelling by motorcycle bearing registration No. MH­20­AP­1058 as pillion rider. When his motorcycle reached in front of Sant Paul High School bus stop, at that time, one truck bearing No. MH­20­CT­7494 came from opposite direction in high speed with negligent manner and gave dash to his motorcycle. In an accident, he sustained multiple injuries and shifted to Government Hospital, Paithan and thereafter at Aurangabad. During treatment, he expired. Medical Officer conducted the postmortem. 3)Concern Police has reached on the spot, made inquiry 3 [MACP No.142/2015] and registered offence against truck driver for the offence punishable under section 279, 304­A etc. of I.P .C. Police prepared spot and inquest panchanama. At the time of an accident, deceased was just 27 years old. Claimant is widow and respondent no. 3 (Kantabai) is mother of deceased. They lost their beloved husband and son. Due to untimely death, they suffered mental agony and even financial crises. 4)She has further contended that, deceased was agriculturists and was also doing milk business and got Rs. 20,000/­ p.m. He was Karta of family. Claimant and respondent no. 3 were depend upon him. Respondent no. 1 is owner, no. 2 is driver of truck. Therefore, both respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation. She lastly prayed compensation of Rs. 7,00,000/­ be awarded alongwith interest @ 18 % p.a. 5)Respondent nos. 1 to 3 have been duly served with summons. They appeared but failed to file written statement. Thus No.W .S. order passed against them. 6)From the rival pleadings of the parties, issues are framed and I record my findings against each issue for the reasons given below :­ 4 SR. NO.ISSUES FINDINGS 1)Whether the claimant prove that, the deceased died in the motor vehicular accident dated 09/08/2014 ?: In the affirmative. 2)Whether the claimant prove that, the deceased died in the accident due to rash and negligent driving of Truck bearing No. MH­20­CT­7494 owned by respondent no. 1 ?: In the affirmative. 3)What is just and reasonable amount of compensation ?: As per final order. 4)What order and Award? :As per final order. REASONS 7) The claimants are relied upon the following documents:­ FIR(Exh.30), Complaint(Exh.31), Spot panchanama (Exh.32), P .M. Report (Exh.33), Inquest panchanama (Exh.34), Permit of offending vehicle (Exh.35), R.C. Book (Exh.36). AS TO ISSUE NOS. 1 & 2 : 8) Issues nos. 1 and 2 are interlinked, therefore, I decide it intermingle to avoid repetitions and for court's convenience. 9) Claimant has examined herself vide Exh. 29 and deposed that, deceased Datta Baburao Bobde was her husband. On the date of an accident, he was travelling by motorcycle bearing No. MH­20­AP­1058 as pillion rider. When motorcycle 5 [MACP No.142/2015] came in front of Bus Stop of Saint Paul High School, at that time, one truck bearing No. MH­20­CT­7494 came from opposite direction in high speed with negligent manner and gave dash to him. In an accident, he sustained multiplier injuries and shifted to Government Hospital Paithan and thereafter at Aurangabad. During treatment, he expired. Medical Officer conducted the postmortem. 10)To support his contention, learned Advocate for the claimant has attracted my attention towards FIR (Exh. 30), complaint (Exh.31), spot panchanama (Exh.32), Postmortem (Exh. 33) and inquest panchanama (Exh. 34). All these documents supports claimant's theory. Not only this, respondents have not taken cross­examination' of claimant. In short, whatever evidence adduced by the claimant has gone unchallenged and un­ rebutted. Not only this, respondent did not take pain to file written statement. Therefore, theory put up by the claimant appears to be genuine and correct. 11)RC Book (Exh. 36) reveals that, respondent no. 1 is owner of the truck. The permit of truck is at Exh. 35. It supports claimant's theory. Respondent no. 2 was driver. Considering the circumstances, I am of view that, deceased died in the motor vehicular accident on 9/8/2014 due to rash and negligent driving of truck bearing No. MH­20­CT­7494, which is owned by 6 respondent no. 1. Thus, I answer issue Nos. 1 and 2 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO. 3 : 12)Claimant has alleged that, deceased was agriculturists and also doing milk business and was getting income of Rs. 20,000/­ p.m. To support her contention, she has not filed cogent and constructive document. Except her bear words nothing has been came on record. Therefore, it is very difficult to conclude that, deceased was agriculturists and doing milk business and was getting Rs. 20,000/­ p.m. In absence of specific income, the income of deceased is considered under “ Notional Income Theory”. In view of Ramchandrappa Vs Manager Royal Sundaram Aliance Insurance Company Ltd. 2011 (4) T.A.C. (SC) ] case, his income is assessed of Rs. 4,500/­ p.m. As per the postmortem, spot and inquest panchanama, his age is 27 years. Therefore, in view of Sarla Verma and ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Ors. Reported in 2009 (2) T.A.C. 677 (Supreme Court ) case, the multiplier “17” would be applicable. Claimant No. 1 is widow and No. 3 is mother of the deceased. There are two dependent upon him, therefore, in view of Sarla Varma's case (Cited Supra ) there would be 1/3rd deduction towards personal and living expenses. Considering the circumstances, I calculate the compensation as follows : 7 [MACP No.142/2015] Sr. No. Heads Calculations Rupees 1 Yearly income of deceased : Rs.4,500 p.m. X 12 = 54,000 3 1/3th deduction as personal and living expenses : Rs. 54,000 – 18,000 =36,000 4 Compensation after applying multiplier of “17” : Rs. 36,000 x 17 = 6,12,000/­ 5 Loss of Love & affection 1,00,000 6 Loss of consortium 40,000 7 Funeral­expenses 15,000 Total = 7,67,000/­ Thus, the claimants are entitled compensation of Rs. 7,67,000/ ­ (Rs. Seven Lacs and Sixty Seven Thousand Only) 13) The claimants have requested to grant interest @ Rs.18% per annum. I am of the view that, the said interest would be exorbitant. Instead of that, as per Kanhsingh Vs Tukaram 2015 (2) T.A.C. 689 (Supreme Court) the interest @ Rs.9% per annum would be proper and reasonable. In view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Khenyei Vs New India Assurance Co. Ltd. (2015) 9 Supreme Court Cases 273 . The claimant can recover the compensation from the respondents jointly and severally. It is 8 a joint tort feasors liability. Thus, I answer issue No. 3 in the affirmative and proceed to pass the following order:­ ORDER 1)The claim­petition is allowed with proportionate costs. 2)The Respondent no. 1 and 2 are held liable jointly and severally to pay the compensation. of Rs. 7,67,000/­ (Rs. Seven Lacs and Sixty Seven Thousand Only) to theclaimant with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of petition, i.e. 04/02/2015, till realization of the entire payment,after deducting the NFL amount, if paid. 3)Out of awarded compensation, an amount of Rs. 4,17,000/­ (Rs. Four Lacs and Seventeen Thousand Only) be given to Claimant No. 1 being a widow. 4)Out of awarded compensation, an amount of Rs. 3,50,000/­ (Rs. Three Lacs and Fifty Thousand Only) be given to Respondent No. 3 being a mother. 5)An award be drawn accordingly. Date :­ 01/02/2018 Sd/­ (C.S. Datir) MEMBER, M.A.C.T ., Aurangabad. …..............

For respondent no.1 and 2 : Ex­parte. For respondent no.3 : Adv. S.V.Kulkarni. .. 2 .. MACP No.730/2015 (Judgment) J U D G M E N T ( Delivered on 20.02.2018 ) The petitioner who was injured in the vehicular accident of Cruiser jeep No. Mh­43 AG­6691 and the container No.GJ­12 AY­8905 has prayed just compensation in view of provision in section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. 2. The facts in brief of the petition are as follows; On 03.10.2015, at about 19.15 hrs. the petitioner was driving the Cruiser Jeep in question which was proceeding from Aurangabad to Kannad road. When said jeep had reached near Shivshakti Dhaba, the container in question came from its opposite side in high speed gave dash to said jeep. In said accident the petitioner had received grievous injuries on his right hand, right eye, face and other parts of his body. For treatment he was removed to MGM Hospital, Aurangabad. He has spent Rs.2 Lakh for his medical treatment and Rs.2 Lakh will be required for his future medical treatment. The Crime was registered about the said accident under CR No.I­209/2015 in Kannad Police Station. The petitioner was 25 years old and working as driver with Mr.Shaikh Ashpaq Sk.Isaq (owner of the Cruiser jeep) on monthly salary Rs.8,000/­. He has became permanently disabled and lost his earning capacity in entirety. Therefore, he has prayed Rs.7 Lakh with interest @ 18% from the owner, the driver and the insurance company of the Container involved in the accident. .. 3 .. MACP No.730/2015 (Judgment) 3.Respondent no.1 who is a driver and respondent no.2 who is the owner of the Container in question have not appeared and matter proceeded ex­parte against them. 4.Respondent No.3 who is the insurance company of the container in question vide Exh.13 has resisted the claim denying almost all pleadings of the petitioner. It is specifically contended that the Container in question was not insured with it on the day of accident. The claim be dismissed for non­ joinder of the owner and the insurance company of the jeep in question. The accident took place due to carelessness of the petitioner himself. Both vehicles were collided with each other and therefore, insurance company of the Container is not liable to pay compensation. The Crime was wrongly registered against the Container in question. Apart from that the age so also source and quantum of monthly income of the petitioner are specifically denied. The driving licence of the driver of the Container and the fitness certificate of the said vehicle were not valid on the day of accident. On all these grounds, the insurance company has prayed for rejection of the claim. 5.In view of rival contentions of the parties, the issues were framed below Exh.14. The issues and findings thereto are as follows: SR.NO. POINTS FINDINGS 1)Whether the petitioner proves that on .. 4 .. MACP No.730/2015 (Judgment) 03.10.2015, at about 19:15 hours, on Aurangabad to Kannad road, near Shivshakti Dhaba, within jurisdiction of Kannad Police Station, an accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of Container bearing registration No.GJ­12 AY­8905? …. Yes. 2)Whether the petitioner proves that he sustained permanent disability in the alleged accident ? …. Yes. 3)Whether the petitioner is entitled to just compensation and interest as prayed?… Yes. Rs.10,71,935/­ with interest @ 7% p.a. 4)What Award and costs? …. The petition allowed against respondent no.2 and 3 and dismissed against respondent no.1. R E A S O N S ISSUE NO.1 : 6.The petitioner to prove that the accident in question was resulted due to rash and negligent driving of the driver of container involved in the accident had adduced his oral evidence. He has produced the certified copies of the FIR of Crime bearing C.R.No.209/2015 registered with Kannad Police Station of offences punishable under sections 279 and 304(A) of Indian Penal Code and punishable under section 177 r/w section 134 of the Motor Vehicles Act, against respondent No.1 who was driving the said container at the time of accident. It is significant to note that respondent No.1 has not appeared and therefore, whatever averments regarding his alleged rash and negligent driving made in the petition and stated in the oral evidence by the petitioner .. 5 .. MACP No.730/2015 (Judgment) have been gone unrebutted and unchallenged. 7.Another important fact is that respondent No.2 in its written statement has taken various defences. First defence is that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the petitioner and second defence is that there was his contribution in the happening of the said accident. But, no evidence of its officer is tendered. No documentary evidence is also produced on record to prove their said defences or to rebut the evidence of the petitioner. In these circumstances, this Court has the only way to consider the oral evidence of the petitioner as he is the injured eye witness of the accident and read the same with his other documentary evidence. 8.Learned Advocate for the insurance company has placed reliance on the law laid down in the decision in case of Laxman Vithoba Gaunkar V/s Sudesh Nanda Gaunkar, 2011(1) Mh.L.J. 845. In said decision it was held that unless and until the claimant proves rashness and negligence on the part of the driver of the offending vehicle, he is not entitled to any compensation under section 166 of the M.V.Act. 9.In the light of the decision (supra) of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court, this Court has carefully read the evidence on record. In its result, it is established that the petitioner has clearly proved that at the time of accident he was driving the Tavera Jeep in question which was coming from Hatnoor .. 6 .. MACP No.730/2015 (Judgment) and proceeding towards Aurangabad. The FIR and the spot panchnama (Exh.18 and 19) have also supported his statement that at about 07.15 p.m. (evening time) when his Jeep had reached near the spot of accident the container in question coming from its opposite side dashed his Jeep. 10.Learned Advocate for the insurance company has placed reliance on the law laid down in the decision in case of Bijoykumar Dugar V/s Bidyadhar Dutta 2006 (1) T.A.C. 969 (SC). In said decision it was held that when the vehicles involved in the accident had “ a head – on collision ”, drivers of both vehicles should be held responsible equally. But, in the case in hand no such evidence has came before this court which indicates that both vehicles had “head on collision ” in the accident in question. There is no iota of evidence which indicates that there was contribution of the petitioner in the happening of accident in question. 11.Having considered the entire evidence on record, I come to the conclusion that the accident in question of both vehicles was resulted due to negligent and rash driving of respondent No.1. Hence, I answer issue No.1 in the affirmative. ISSUE NO.2 TO 4 : 12.Admittedly, the petitioner was driving the jeep in question at the .. 7 .. MACP No.730/2015 (Judgment) time of accident. He has produced his driving licence (Exh.23). In short, it is proved that on the day of accident he was the driver of motor vehicles by profession. He was having said special skill and also holding licence for that. 13.Through the oral evidence of the petitioner, the discharge card of his treatment and oral evidence of Dr.Pameshwar Jaiswal (PW6) who has issued disability certificate (Exh.24). PW6 has stated that the petitioner's right hand has 15% permanent disability resulted because of injuries he had received in the accident in question. Dr.Parmeshwar Jaiswal (PW6) has not given any admissions to learned Advocate for insurance company. In my opinion, because of that he has lost his driving skill permanently. Therefore, it is nothing but 100% loss of his earning capacity. But, he can do any other job other than driving. Therefore, I deem it just and proper to assume his permanent disability as 50% instead of 100% for the purpose of making deduction from his monthly income. Hence, I answer issue No.2 accordingly. 14.The petitioner has produced Discharge Card (Exh.25) issued by MGM Hospital, Aurangabad. It supports his statement that after the accident he was removed to Mahatma Gandhi Mission Hospital, Aurangabad on 04.10.2015 and he was there under treatment till 16.10.2015. He has produced Hospital bills, medicine bills (colly) Exh.33. This evidence has proved that the petitioner has paid Rs.1,07,295/­ as hospital bill to above named hospital of his treatment as indoor patient. .. 8 .. MACP No.730/2015 (Judgment) 15.Mr.Mohammad Salman Ansari (PW3)­ accountant of New Harsh Medical and General Stores, Aurangabad has proved said bills. The petitioner has produced the hospital bill ( Exh.38) five cash receipts and two blood receipts (colly Exh.39) issued by MGM Hospital, Aurangabad. Mr. Rameshwar Mandve (PW4) has proved these documents. This evidence has proved that he had purchased the medicines and blood for his treatment respectively of Rs.19,425/­ and Rs.6,800/­. 16.He has also produced the medicine purchase bills (colly. Exh.41) purchased from medical stores of MGM Hospital, Aurangabad. Avinash Borde (PW5) who is Pharmacist in said store has proved the same. This evidence has proved that he had purchased the medicines of Rs.9,415/­ for his treatment. 17.Considering the amount of hospital bills, purchase of medicines and blood by the petitioner for his medical treatment on the injuries he has received in the accident in question, I hold that he is entitled to receive Rs.1,07,295/­ + Rs.19,425/­ + Rs.6,800/­ + Rs.9,415/­ from respondent No.2 and 3. 18.The petitioner has produced his motor driving licence (Exh.23). In said document his date of birth is shown as 06.12.1990. It indicates that on .. 9 .. MACP No.730/2015 (Judgment) the day of accident he was 24 years 10 months old. Therefore, the multiplicand '18' applies in this case for the purpose of making computation of compensation. 19.The petitioner has produced oral evidence of his employer ­ Shaikh Ashpaq Shaikh Isaq (PW2). This witness has proved the certificate (Exh.28). His oral evidence and the said certificate has proved that he is the owner of Cruiser Jeep involved in the accident he had employed the petitioner as a driver on said vehicle on monthly salary of Rs.8,000/­. Learned Advocate for the insurance company has tried to impeach is testimony, but in vain. He has not given any admission in cross­examination to overlook his oral evidence. Hence, I accept that the petitioner was working as the driver on the Cruiser jeep in question at the time of accident and earning monthly salary of Rs.8,000/­. 20.Accordingly, I proceed to make the computation of just compensation which he is entitled to receive only from respondent No.2 and 3 as follows : Computation of the compensation 1.Monthly income of the petitionerRs.8,000/­ 2.Permanent disability percentage of right hand­15% due to which he has lost his driving skill 100%. But, he can do any other Rs.4,000/­ .. 10 .. MACP No.730/2015 (Judgment) work and therefore, it is reduced to 50% for the purpose of making deduction from monthly salary. 3.Yearly income of the petitioner Rs.4,000/­ x 12Rs.48,000/­ 4.Multiplicand – 18 as he was 24 years 10 months old on the day of accident.Rs.48,000/­x 18Rs.8,64,000/­ 5.Conveyance, special attendant and special diet Rs.5,000/­for each head.Rs.5,000/­x 3Rs.15,000/­ 6.Pain and sufferings. Rs.25,000/­ 7.Hospital bills, medicine bills (colly Exh.33, Exh.38, 39 and 41) of medical treatment.Rs.1,07,295/­ + Rs.19,425/­ + Rs.6,800/­ + Rs.9,415/­Rs. 1,42,935/­ 8.For future medical treatment Rs.25,000/­ 9.Total compensation (total of col.4 to 8)Rs.10,71,935/­ 10.Interest. @ 7% p.a. In view of the above mentioned computation, I hold that the petitioner is entitled to get Rs.10,71,935/­ as just compensation under pecuniary and non­pecuniary heads only from respondent no. 2 and 3 with interest @ 7% p.a. from the date of the application till its realization and costs. Accordingly, I answer issue No.3 and pass the following order : O R D E R 1)The application is allowed with costs against respondent no.2 and 3, and dismissed with costs against respondent no.1. .. 11 .. MACP No.730/2015 (Judgment) 2)Respondent no.2 and 3 shall jointly and severally pay Rs.10,71,935/­ inclusive of NFL amount, with interest @ 7% p.a. from the date of the application till realization of entire amount, to the petitioner within two months from today by Demand Draft issued in his name. 3)The Award be drawn up accordingly.

For respondent no.1 and 2 : Ex­parte. For respondent no.3 : Adv. S.V.Kulkarni. .. 2 .. MACP No.730/2015 (Judgment) J U D G M E N T ( Delivered on 20.02.2018 ) The petitioner who was injured in the vehicular accident of Cruiser jeep No. Mh­43 AG­6691 and the container No.GJ­12 AY­8905 has prayed just compensation in view of provision in section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. 2. The facts in brief of the petition are as follows; On 03.10.2015, at about 19.15 hrs. the petitioner was driving the Cruiser Jeep in question which was proceeding from Aurangabad to Kannad road. When said jeep had reached near Shivshakti Dhaba, the container in question came from its opposite side in high speed gave dash to said jeep. In said accident the petitioner had received grievous injuries on his right hand, right eye, face and other parts of his body. For treatment he was removed to MGM Hospital, Aurangabad. He has spent Rs.2 Lakh for his medical treatment and Rs.2 Lakh will be required for his future medical treatment. The Crime was registered about the said accident under CR No.I­209/2015 in Kannad Police Station. The petitioner was 25 years old and working as driver with Mr.Shaikh Ashpaq Sk.Isaq (owner of the Cruiser jeep) on monthly salary Rs.8,000/­. He has became permanently disabled and lost his earning capacity in entirety. Therefore, he has prayed Rs.7 Lakh with interest @ 18% from the owner, the driver and the insurance company of the Container involved in the accident. .. 3 .. MACP No.730/2015 (Judgment) 3.Respondent no.1 who is a driver and respondent no.2 who is the owner of the Container in question have not appeared and matter proceeded ex­parte against them. 4.Respondent No.3 who is the insurance company of the container in question vide Exh.13 has resisted the claim denying almost all pleadings of the petitioner. It is specifically contended that the Container in question was not insured with it on the day of accident. The claim be dismissed for non­ joinder of the owner and the insurance company of the jeep in question. The accident took place due to carelessness of the petitioner himself. Both vehicles were collided with each other and therefore, insurance company of the Container is not liable to pay compensation. The Crime was wrongly registered against the Container in question. Apart from that the age so also source and quantum of monthly income of the petitioner are specifically denied. The driving licence of the driver of the Container and the fitness certificate of the said vehicle were not valid on the day of accident. On all these grounds, the insurance company has prayed for rejection of the claim. 5.In view of rival contentions of the parties, the issues were framed below Exh.14. The issues and findings thereto are as follows: SR.NO. POINTS FINDINGS 1)Whether the petitioner proves that on .. 4 .. MACP No.730/2015 (Judgment) 03.10.2015, at about 19:15 hours, on Aurangabad to Kannad road, near Shivshakti Dhaba, within jurisdiction of Kannad Police Station, an accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of Container bearing registration No.GJ­12 AY­8905? …. Yes. 2)Whether the petitioner proves that he sustained permanent disability in the alleged accident ? …. Yes. 3)Whether the petitioner is entitled to just compensation and interest as prayed?… Yes. Rs.10,71,935/­ with interest @ 7% p.a. 4)What Award and costs? …. The petition allowed against respondent no.2 and 3 and dismissed against respondent no.1. R E A S O N S ISSUE NO.1 : 6.The petitioner to prove that the accident in question was resulted due to rash and negligent driving of the driver of container involved in the accident had adduced his oral evidence. He has produced the certified copies of the FIR of Crime bearing C.R.No.209/2015 registered with Kannad Police Station of offences punishable under sections 279 and 304(A) of Indian Penal Code and punishable under section 177 r/w section 134 of the Motor Vehicles Act, against respondent No.1 who was driving the said container at the time of accident. It is significant to note that respondent No.1 has not appeared and therefore, whatever averments regarding his alleged rash and negligent driving made in the petition and stated in the oral evidence by the petitioner .. 5 .. MACP No.730/2015 (Judgment) have been gone unrebutted and unchallenged. 7.Another important fact is that respondent No.2 in its written statement has taken various defences. First defence is that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the petitioner and second defence is that there was his contribution in the happening of the said accident. But, no evidence of its officer is tendered. No documentary evidence is also produced on record to prove their said defences or to rebut the evidence of the petitioner. In these circumstances, this Court has the only way to consider the oral evidence of the petitioner as he is the injured eye witness of the accident and read the same with his other documentary evidence. 8.Learned Advocate for the insurance company has placed reliance on the law laid down in the decision in case of Laxman Vithoba Gaunkar V/s Sudesh Nanda Gaunkar, 2011(1) Mh.L.J. 845. In said decision it was held that unless and until the claimant proves rashness and negligence on the part of the driver of the offending vehicle, he is not entitled to any compensation under section 166 of the M.V.Act. 9.In the light of the decision (supra) of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court, this Court has carefully read the evidence on record. In its result, it is established that the petitioner has clearly proved that at the time of accident he was driving the Tavera Jeep in question which was coming from Hatnoor .. 6 .. MACP No.730/2015 (Judgment) and proceeding towards Aurangabad. The FIR and the spot panchnama (Exh.18 and 19) have also supported his statement that at about 07.15 p.m. (evening time) when his Jeep had reached near the spot of accident the container in question coming from its opposite side dashed his Jeep. 10.Learned Advocate for the insurance company has placed reliance on the law laid down in the decision in case of Bijoykumar Dugar V/s Bidyadhar Dutta 2006 (1) T.A.C. 969 (SC). In said decision it was held that when the vehicles involved in the accident had “ a head – on collision ”, drivers of both vehicles should be held responsible equally. But, in the case in hand no such evidence has came before this court which indicates that both vehicles had “head on collision ” in the accident in question. There is no iota of evidence which indicates that there was contribution of the petitioner in the happening of accident in question. 11.Having considered the entire evidence on record, I come to the conclusion that the accident in question of both vehicles was resulted due to negligent and rash driving of respondent No.1. Hence, I answer issue No.1 in the affirmative. ISSUE NO.2 TO 4 : 12.Admittedly, the petitioner was driving the jeep in question at the .. 7 .. MACP No.730/2015 (Judgment) time of accident. He has produced his driving licence (Exh.23). In short, it is proved that on the day of accident he was the driver of motor vehicles by profession. He was having said special skill and also holding licence for that. 13.Through the oral evidence of the petitioner, the discharge card of his treatment and oral evidence of Dr.Pameshwar Jaiswal (PW6) who has issued disability certificate (Exh.24). PW6 has stated that the petitioner's right hand has 15% permanent disability resulted because of injuries he had received in the accident in question. Dr.Parmeshwar Jaiswal (PW6) has not given any admissions to learned Advocate for insurance company. In my opinion, because of that he has lost his driving skill permanently. Therefore, it is nothing but 100% loss of his earning capacity. But, he can do any other job other than driving. Therefore, I deem it just and proper to assume his permanent disability as 50% instead of 100% for the purpose of making deduction from his monthly income. Hence, I answer issue No.2 accordingly. 14.The petitioner has produced Discharge Card (Exh.25) issued by MGM Hospital, Aurangabad. It supports his statement that after the accident he was removed to Mahatma Gandhi Mission Hospital, Aurangabad on 04.10.2015 and he was there under treatment till 16.10.2015. He has produced Hospital bills, medicine bills (colly) Exh.33. This evidence has proved that the petitioner has paid Rs.1,07,295/­ as hospital bill to above named hospital of his treatment as indoor patient. .. 8 .. MACP No.730/2015 (Judgment) 15.Mr.Mohammad Salman Ansari (PW3)­ accountant of New Harsh Medical and General Stores, Aurangabad has proved said bills. The petitioner has produced the hospital bill ( Exh.38) five cash receipts and two blood receipts (colly Exh.39) issued by MGM Hospital, Aurangabad. Mr. Rameshwar Mandve (PW4) has proved these documents. This evidence has proved that he had purchased the medicines and blood for his treatment respectively of Rs.19,425/­ and Rs.6,800/­. 16.He has also produced the medicine purchase bills (colly. Exh.41) purchased from medical stores of MGM Hospital, Aurangabad. Avinash Borde (PW5) who is Pharmacist in said store has proved the same. This evidence has proved that he had purchased the medicines of Rs.9,415/­ for his treatment. 17.Considering the amount of hospital bills, purchase of medicines and blood by the petitioner for his medical treatment on the injuries he has received in the accident in question, I hold that he is entitled to receive Rs.1,07,295/­ + Rs.19,425/­ + Rs.6,800/­ + Rs.9,415/­ from respondent No.2 and 3. 18.The petitioner has produced his motor driving licence (Exh.23). In said document his date of birth is shown as 06.12.1990. It indicates that on .. 9 .. MACP No.730/2015 (Judgment) the day of accident he was 24 years 10 months old. Therefore, the multiplicand '18' applies in this case for the purpose of making computation of compensation. 19.The petitioner has produced oral evidence of his employer ­ Shaikh Ashpaq Shaikh Isaq (PW2). This witness has proved the certificate (Exh.28). His oral evidence and the said certificate has proved that he is the owner of Cruiser Jeep involved in the accident he had employed the petitioner as a driver on said vehicle on monthly salary of Rs.8,000/­. Learned Advocate for the insurance company has tried to impeach is testimony, but in vain. He has not given any admission in cross­examination to overlook his oral evidence. Hence, I accept that the petitioner was working as the driver on the Cruiser jeep in question at the time of accident and earning monthly salary of Rs.8,000/­. 20.Accordingly, I proceed to make the computation of just compensation which he is entitled to receive only from respondent No.2 and 3 as follows : Computation of the compensation 1.Monthly income of the petitionerRs.8,000/­ 2.Permanent disability percentage of right hand­15% due to which he has lost his driving skill 100%. But, he can do any other Rs.4,000/­ .. 10 .. MACP No.730/2015 (Judgment) work and therefore, it is reduced to 50% for the purpose of making deduction from monthly salary. 3.Yearly income of the petitioner Rs.4,000/­ x 12Rs.48,000/­ 4.Multiplicand – 18 as he was 24 years 10 months old on the day of accident.Rs.48,000/­x 18Rs.8,64,000/­ 5.Conveyance, special attendant and special diet Rs.5,000/­for each head.Rs.5,000/­x 3Rs.15,000/­ 6.Pain and sufferings. Rs.25,000/­ 7.Hospital bills, medicine bills (colly Exh.33, Exh.38, 39 and 41) of medical treatment.Rs.1,07,295/­ + Rs.19,425/­ + Rs.6,800/­ + Rs.9,415/­Rs. 1,42,935/­ 8.For future medical treatment Rs.25,000/­ 9.Total compensation (total of col.4 to 8)Rs.10,71,935/­ 10.Interest. @ 7% p.a. In view of the above mentioned computation, I hold that the petitioner is entitled to get Rs.10,71,935/­ as just compensation under pecuniary and non­pecuniary heads only from respondent no. 2 and 3 with interest @ 7% p.a. from the date of the application till its realization and costs. Accordingly, I answer issue No.3 and pass the following order : O R D E R 1)The application is allowed with costs against respondent no.2 and 3, and dismissed with costs against respondent no.1. .. 11 .. MACP No.730/2015 (Judgment) 2)Respondent no.2 and 3 shall jointly and severally pay Rs.10,71,935/­ inclusive of NFL amount, with interest @ 7% p.a. from the date of the application till realization of entire amount, to the petitioner within two months from today by Demand Draft issued in his name. 3)The Award be drawn up accordingly.

At that time one Car bearing registration No. MH­20­AG­4591 came from opposite direction in a high speed and in a rash and negligent manner gave dash to rickshaw of the injured Bismillabi w/o Mehboob Shaikh. Due to which the accident took place. The claimant had sustained multiple injuries on several parts of the body. She was shifted to G.M.C. Hospital, Aurangabad for medical treatment. She was admitted from 21.04.2015 to 23.04.2015 as per discharge card. The concern police authority of police station Daulatabad had registered the crime bearing No. I­30/2015 for the offence punishable under section 279, 304­A of the IPC against the driver of said offending Car No. MH­20­AG­4591. 4 3]On the date of accident claimant Bismillabi w/o Mehboob Shaikh was only aged about 40 years. Due to injuries sustained by her in an accident, she is totally disable and unable to walk and do daily work and sustained permanent disability. 4]Respondent No.1 Feroz Khan is the driver of the offending vehicle. Respondent No.2 Shaikh Mohd Abdul Qadar is the registered owner of the said offending vehicle. Respondent No.4 is the United Indian Insurance Co.Ltd. ­ insured as the offending vehicle – Car No. MH­20­AG­4591 was validly insured. The insurance policy stands in the name of Respondent No.3 – Rameshwar D Sarowar. As such he was the insured. 5]The offending car was validly insured with Respondent No.4. Lastly, claim petitioner claims Rs.4,00,000/­ towards compensation amount – under the various heads shock, pain and agony, etc. and submitted to allow the claim with 18% interest as against all respondents. 6]Respondent Nos.1 and 2 have filed their written statement cum say vide exh.20. They have admitted that, registration number of offending vehicle – Car is MH­20­AG­4591, Bismillabi Vs. Feroz Khan & ors. 5 Judgment – MACP No.636/2015 owned by Respondent No.2 Shaikh Mohd Abdul Qadar and also admits that, offending vehicle – Car No. MH­20­AG­4591 is insured with Respondent No.4 – insurance company. They have denied that, Respondent No.1 was rash and negligent while driving the offending vehicle on the date of accident. They have admitted that, police authority of police station Daultabad has registered the crime as alleged. They have denied the age, income of the victim / claimant and allegations about the rash and negligent driving. Further, they contended that, Respondent No.1 was having valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident and the said car was validly insured with Respondent No.4 – insurance company. They resisted the claim of the claimant and submited to reject this claim. 7]Respondent No.3 failed to appear despite service of summons / notice hence, order passed against him to proceed th case ex parte below exh.1. 8]Respondent No.4 – insurance company has filed detailed written statement cum say vide exh.21. In the say and written statement Respondent – insurance company has denied each and everything including about the involvement of the 6 vehicle, the occurrence of the accident, age, income of the victim – claimant. Further, it is the defence of insurance company that, accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the driver of the Ape­rickshaw. Further, it is submitted that, claimant in collusion with owner and driver of Car No. MH­20­AG­4591 has filed present claim petition to grab the compensation money from the insurance company. Hence, claim petition deserves to be dismissed. 9]On the date of accident the driver of the alleged Car No. MH­20­AG­4591 involved in an accident was not holding valid and effective driving licence. Hence, there is a breach of terms and conditions of insurance policy. Further, it is contended that, claimant has not made party as respondents to the driver, owner and insurer of Ape­rickshaw. The vehicle – Ape­rickshaw involved in an accident has contributed to the alleged accident. Therefore, claimant is not entitled to get any compensation. Lastly insurance company submitted to dismiss the claim. 10]Considering the rival contentions and pleadings of both side, I have framed the issues vide exh.25, which are being reproduced as follows, and my findings with reasons thereon are as follows :­ Bismillabi Vs. Feroz Khan & ors. 7 Judgment – MACP No.636/2015 ISSUES FINDINGS 1]Whether the accident took place due to rash or negligent driving of the motor vehicle i.e. Car bearing registration No. MH­20­AG­4591 driven by Respondent No.1 ? In the affirmative. 2]Whether the claimant sustained permanent disability due to the injuries suffered by her in the said accident ? If yes, to what extent ? Yes, 16%. 3]Whether the claimant is entitled to get compensation amount ? If yes, to what extent ? Yes, Rs.1,00,000/­only. 4]Who is liable to pay compensation ? All Respondent Nos.1 to 4 jointly and severally. 5]What order and award ? As per final order. R E A S O N S 11]Heard argument of learned counsel for claimant Mr.Mohsin Quazi and learned counsel Mr.S.D. Shinde for Respondent No.4 – insurance company at length. No response from learned counsel Shri A.S. More for Respondent Nos.1 and 2 at the time of final argument. Perused the record and proceeding carefully. AS TO ISSUE NO.1 :­ 12]In order to establish the claim, claimant has examined herself as witness no.1 at exh.28 and also led evidence of her second witness PW2 Dr.Sachin Surendra Bedmutha at exh.40. 8 13]Claimant relied on the documents – certified copies of chargesheet (exh.31), spot panchanama (exh.32), copy of FIR (exh.33), driving licence of respondent No.1 (exh.34), RC book of offending vehicle (exh.35), insurance policy (exh.36), AA Form (exh.37), discharge card (exh.38) and permanent disability certainly (exh.41). 14]Claimant has filed evidence close purshis vide exh.42. No oral evidence on behalf of respondents side on record. 15]Claimant has filed on record the copy of her aadhar card below list exh.45 in which the year of birth is mentioned as 1967. Evidence of claimant is testified. 16]Admittedly, the accident has taken place on 20.04.2015 when the claimant was traveling by Ape­rickshaw No.MH­20­AA­5198 and the offending vehicle – Car No. MH­20­ AG­4591 has given the dash to said rickshaw and claimant had sustained the injuries. 17]From the oral evidence of claimant – PW1 and the police case papers on record, chargesheet vide exh.31, spot Bismillabi Vs. Feroz Khan & ors. 9 Judgment – MACP No.636/2015 panchanama exh.32, FIR exh.33 and Form Comp.AA exh.37, it is evident that, the offending vehicle – Car No. MH­20­AG­4591 is involved in an accident and the driver of the offending vehicle – Respondent No.1 – Feroz Khan was driver on the date of accident. 18]Claimant led oral and documentary evidence in support of her claim just to prove the fact that, Respondent No.1 was rash and negligent while driving the offending vehicle on the date of accident. Due to this the accident occurred and claimant sustained the injuries in an accident. However, Respondent Nos.1 to 3 did not step into the witness box to deny the allegations about the rash and negligent driving at the hands of Respondent No.1 – Feroz Khan. They have filed the written statement on record vide exh.20 but did not take pains to step into the witness box to deny the allegations about the rash and negligent driving and about the occurrence of the accident. Adverse inference can be drawn as against Respondent No.1 ­ driver of offending vehicle. Therefore, issue no.1 is proved. Hence, I answer issue no.1 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO.2 :­ 19]Claimant – Bismillahbi deposed that, she has sustained permanent disability due to the injuries suffered by her 10 in the said accident. Just to prove the permanent disability she has adduced evidence of her second witness Dr.Sachin Bedmutha at exh.40, who deposed that, as per permanent disability certificate exh.41, the claimant has sustained 16% permanent disability. Dr.Sachin Bedmutha also deposed that, he examined claimant clinically and radiologically and after going through the old case papers he found that, claimant Bismillahbi had posted dislocation of right hip, for which she was treated at G.M.C. Hospital, Aurangabad with traction. Due to her injuries she had right hip gross movement restriction. So according to the McBride scale he issued her disability certificate to the extent of 16% permanent disability vide certificate exh.41. 20]From the record it is crystal clear that, claimant was admitted to G.M.C. Hospital, Aurangabad vide discharge card exh.38, which reveals that, she was admitted on 21.04.2015 and discharged on 23.04.2015. As such I hold that, claimant has sustained permanent disability due to the injuries suffered by her in an accident to the extent of 16%, as deposed by Dr.Sachin Bedmutha. Therefore, I answer issue no.2 in the affirmative. Bismillabi Vs. Feroz Khan & ors. 11 Judgment – MACP No.636/2015 AS TO ISSUE NOS.3 TO 5 :­ 21]Upon careful scanning the oral and documentary evidence as led by the claimant, it is evident that, the accident has taken place in which the claimant Bismillahbi meet with an accident and suffered permanent disability to the extent of 16%. However, nature of her injury is right side post hip dislocation vide discharge card exh.38 and permanent disability certificate exh.41. However, there is no fracture injury sustained by the claimant. 22]It is pertinent to note that, as per the discharge card exh.38 claimant was only admitted from 21.04.2015 to 23.04.2015 and she has not taken any medical treatment in any other hospital and no document to that effect is on record. 23]In the circumstances, to some extent also claimant has also sustained the permanent disability and she has suffered the injuries in an accident i.e. due to accident she suffered the injuries. 24]Now so as to determine the loss of income, however, in the circumstances as I find that, in fact, there was no fracture injury to the claimant and there is no medical expenses and by short period of admission in the hospital from 21.04.2015 to 12 23.04.2015 as her right hip dislocation, etc. and considering the facts and circumstances and evidence on record, an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ as a lump­sum compensation amount would be just and reasonable towards pain and suffering, agony, attendant charges, transportation charges, diet, on all count, etc. 25]As per the verdict of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Smt.Neeta w/o Kallappa Kadolkar and others Vs. The Divisional Manager, MSRTC, Kolhapur, 2015(1) T.A.C. 340 (S.C.), I award 9% interest on the compensation amount. 26]No doubt, the offending vehicle is owned by Respondent No.2, Respondent No.3 is the policy holder of offending vehicle, Respondent No.1 is the driver of offending vehicle No. MH­20­Ag­4591 and Respondent No.4 is the insurance company of the offending vehicle with whom the offending vehicle was insured vide insurance policy exh.36 for the period from 24.06.2014 to 23.06.2015 and the accident has taken place on 20.04.2015. Therefore, the insurance policy covers the claim, accident and risk. In the circumstances all the respondent nos.1 to 4 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation amount to the claimant. Bismillabi Vs. Feroz Khan & ors. 13 Judgment – MACP No.636/2015 27]Therefore, the claim deserves to be allowed with proportionate costs as against all respondents. All respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation amount to the claimant. In the circumstances I answer issue nos.3 to 5 in the affirmative accordingly and proceed to pass following order :­ ORDER 1]The claim of the claimant is hereby allowed partly with proportionate costs as follows:­ 2]All Respondent Nos.1 to 4 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ (Rupees One Lakh only) to the claimant with 9% interest from the date of filing of this claim petition i.e. 19.09.2015 till its realization, including NFL amount of Rs.25,000/­, by account payee cheque. 3]Award be prepared accordingly.

Mr V .C. Sarode, Advocate for Claimants. Mr R.H. Dahat, Advocate for Respondent No.1 Mr R.G. Ghode, Advocate for respondent no. 2 ....................................................................................................... J U D G M E N T (Delivered in open court on 13/12/2017) This petition is filed by the claimants for grant of compensation of Rs.20,00,000/­ under Section 166 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. 2)Claimant's case in nutshell is as under :­ They have alleged that, an accident took place on 15.8.2015 at about 8.30 hours on Aurangabad­Ahemadnagar High way. At the time of accident, Maruti Elag was driving motorcycle. When he reached near Golwadi phata, at that time, another motorcycle bearing No. MH­20­CM­4530 came from opposite 3 [MACP No.625/2015] direction in high speed with rash and negligent manner and gave dash to him. In the accident, he sustained multiple injuries and died on the spot. 3)They have further contended that, he was shifted to Government Hospital Aurangabad. Medical Officer examined him and carried postmortem. The concerned police came on the spot, made inquiry and registered F .I.R., against respondent No.2 who was driving the motorcycle bearing No. MH­20­CM­4530. Police has prepared spot and inquest panchanama. 4)They have contended that, deceased was just 30 years old. Claimant No.1 is widow, No.2 and 3 are parents, 4 and 5 are sister of deceased. He was serving in '' Torne Printers'' CIDCO, Aurangabad and getting salary of Rs. 9,500/­ per month. He was the only earning member. Claimants are depend upon him. Due to untimely death, they are facing starvation. He was skilled employee, therefore definitely he could have get future prospectus during his service. 5)Respondent No.2 was driving the motorcycle in rash and negligent manner. He is sole responsible for the same. He is owner cum driver. The motorcycle was duly insured with respondent No.1. Therefore, both respondents are liable to get compensation. They have lastly prayed compensation of Rs. 20,00,000/­ be awarded with interest @ 18% p.a. 4 6)Respondent no 1 has filed written statement vide Exh. 21 and resisted the claim in toto. According to him, an accident did not occur due to negligence of respondent no. 2. On the contrary, deceased was driving motorcycle in rash and negligent manner and went towards wrong side. Moreover, deceased did not wear helmet and was not having license. He has breached conditions of policy. On all these grounds, claim is not tenable. 7)He has further contended that, deceased was not doing job with '' Torne Printers'' and getting salary of Rs. 9,500/­ per month, therefore, question of future prospectus does not arise. An incident occurred due to sole negligence of deceased. Moreover, claimant has not made party to the insurance company of the motorcycle of deceased. Claim is bad for non joinder of necessary parties. Claimant Nos. 4 and 5 are not dependent. They are major, therefore, they cannot be said as dependents. Moreover, there is no driving license to respondent no. 2. It amounts to breach of conditions, therefore, liability cannot be fasten against insurance company. He lastly prayed, claim may be rejected. 8)Respondent no. 2 filed written statement vide Exh. 22 and also denied allegations. He has contended that, there is no involvement of motorcycle No. MH­20­CM­4530. No accident occurred as alleged. Deceased was aged more 30 years. He was 5 [MACP No.625/2015] not serving in ''Torne Printers'' as alleged. Therefore, there is no salary as such and nobody was depend upon him. Deceased is responsible for an accident. Police has registered FIR without proper inquiry. He was holding valid and effective license and his motorcycle is insured with respondent no. 1, therefore, he is not responsible to pay compensation. In all counts, claim is not tenable and may be rejected. 9)From the rival pleadings of the parties, issues are framed and I record my findings against each of them for the reasons given below:­ Sr. No.ISSUES FINDINGS 1Do claimants prove that, an accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of motorcycle bearing No. MH­ 20­CM­4530 ?: In the affirmative. 2Do claimants further prove that, due to injuries caused in the accident Maruti Ananda Elag succumbed to death ?: In the affirmative. 3Do the claimants prove that respondent no. 1 is driver cum owner and no. 2 is insurance company of the motorcycle no. MH­20­CM­4530 ?: In the affirmative. 4Whether the claimants are entitled to get compensation, if yes, at what rate ?:As per final order. 5Who is responsible to pay compensation ?Both respondent jointly and severally. 6What order and award ? :As per final order. 6 REASONS 10)The claimants are relied upon the following documents:­ FIR (Exh.28), Spot panchanama (Exh.29), Inquest panchanama (Exh.30), P .M. report (Exh.31), RC Book of offending motorcycle (Exh.32), Insurance Policy (Exh.33), Driving license of respondent no. 2 (Exh.34), AA Form (Exh.35), salary certificate (Exh. 38), Charge­sheet (Exh. 54), Arrest panchanama (Exh. 55), M.L.C. (Exh. 56), Statement of witnesses (Exh. 57 & 58), Accident report form (Exh. 60), driving license of deceased with list Exh. 52. AS TO ISSUE NOS. 1 to 3 : 11)Issues nos. 1 to 3 are interlinked, therefore, I decide it intermingle to avoid repetitions and for court's convenience. 12)Claimants have alleged that, an accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the driver of motorcycle bearing No. MH­20­CM­4530 and the injured was expired due to injuries sustained to him. They have further alleged that, respondent no. 1 was owner cum driver of the motorcycle which was duly insured with respondent no. 2. 13)To support this contention, learned Advocate for the claimant has attracted my attention towards FIR (Exh. 28), spot panchanama (Exh. 29) accident report form (Exh. 35) and some 7 [MACP No.625/2015] statements of witnesses recorded by police. Upon perusal of complaint & FIR, it reveals that Maruti Elag was driving his motorcycle and proceeding towards Bajaj Nagar. At that time, another motorcycle bearing No. MH­20­CM­4530 came from opposite side in high speed with rash and negligent manner and gave dash to him. In the accident, he sustained multiple injuries and admitted in Government Hospital, where doctor declared as dead. 14)The concern police reached on the spot, made inquiry and registered offence against respondent no. 2 for the offence punishable under section 279, 304­A of I.P .C. As FIR lodged against respondent no. 2, it prima­facie reveals that, he would be the responsible for an accident. To fasten liability, police has recorded statement of witnesses, prepared spot panchanama and came to conclusion that, respondent no. 2 was driving motorcycle in rash and negligent manner and caused an accident. 15)Moreover, learned Advocate of Claimants has attracted my attention towards spot panchanama Exh. 29. It reveals that, an accident occurred on Ahmednagar ­ Aurangabad high way. It is sufficient wide. There are dividers. Victim was proceeding towards Bajaj Nagar. An accident occurred towards left side of the divider. It means, victim was proceeding towards his left side but the offending motorcycle of respondent no. 2 came in 8 high speed and went towards wrong side. An accident spot clearly reveals that, respondent no. 2 came towards wrong side. It supports the claimant's theory. If respondent no. 2 would have been drive his motorcycle towards his left side, an accident could have been avoided. Moreover, police has recorded statements of Kishor Nade and Akash Nikalje during inquiry. They deposed that, they were triple seat on the motorcycle of respondent no. 2. Moreover, respondent no. 2 is the eye witness. He knows how an accident took place. Even though he did not cross examine to claimant or his witness. Moreover, he did not lead evidence to support his contention. In short, whatever evidence adduced by claimant has gone unchallenged so far respondent no. 2 is concern. If really, he would have not responsible for an accident, he could have cross­ examine and lead the evidence. But he has not chosen so. Therefore, there is no hesitation to say that, an accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 2. 16)Police has prepared inquest panchanama (Exh. 30). Dead body was sent to Government Hospital, Aurangabad for postmortem. Autopsy Surgeon made postmortem. Opinion as to the cause of death is Head Injury. The driving license of respondent no. 2 is at Exh. 32. The insurance policy is at Exh. 33, AA Form is at Exh. 35, driving license of deceased is filed along 9 [MACP No.625/2015] with Exh. 52. It reveals that, respondent no. 2 was driving motorcycle no. MH­20­CM­4530 which was duly insured with respondent no. 1 and in that accident, Maruti Elag expired due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 2. 17)Learned Advocate for the respondent no. 1 (Insurance Company) has vehemently argued that, an accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of deceased and there is no fault of respondent no.2. To support his contention, he has examined respondent no. 2 as his witness. He deposed that, when he was proceeding towards Bajaj Nagar by Aurangabad – Nagar high way. At that time, he was driving motorcycle by left side. One motorcycle came from offending side and dashed to him by coming towards wrong side. I think, his evidence is not trustworthy, because, he is respondent no. 2. He is the owner cum driver of the motorcycle in question. Being respondent no. 2, why he has not examined himself and cross­examined to the claimant. This conduct goes to show that, he is trying to shift his legal liability upon insurance company. 18)Learned Advocate of respondent no. 1 has argued that, deceased did not wear helmet at the time of accident. Therefore, his contributory negligence to the extent of 30% may be held. I am of view that, police has filed charge­sheet against respondent no. 2, saying that, he was negligent at the time of 10 accident. It is not the case of police authority that, deceased was in rash and negligent manner and he is responsible for an accident. Moreover court has held that respondent no. 2 is responsible for an accident. Therefore, mere deceased did not wear helmet does not mean that, he has contributed for an accident. Thus, this defence would not be tenable. 19)Learned Advocate for the respondent no. 1 has further argued that, deceased did not have license at the time of accident. Therefore, liability to pay compensation cannot be fasten against the company. I am of view that, the claimant has filed driving license of deceased vide list Exh. 52, therefore, this defence also not tenable. Considering entire circumstances, I answer issue Nos. 1 to 3 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NOS. 3 & 4 : 20)According to claimant, deceased Maruti Elag was serving in ''Torne Printers'' at CIDCO, Aurangabad and was getting salary Rs. 9,500/­ per month. To support his contention, he has examined Shri Vishwaraj Torne a Proprietor of ''Torne Printers'' vide Exh. 37. He deposed that, Maruti Elag was working in his Printing press since 2011 as Lamination and Paunching Operator and was getting salary of Rs. 9,500/­ per month. He has also filed salary certificate vide Exh. 38. Therefore, there is no hesitation to say that, deceased was working in ''Torne Printers''. 11 [MACP No.625/2015] 21)Now question remains, how much salary he was getting. According to claimant, he was getting salary Rs. 9,500/­ p.m. The claimant has not filed bank pass book. Generally, the Proprietor gives salary certificate 20 to 25% at higher side in order to help legal heirs of deceased. The general tendency is to show sympathy towards deceased. Therefore, I am of view that, 25% salary needs to be deducted. Thus, I assessed his salary as Rs. 7,000/­ p.m. It would be more appropriate and no injustice would be caused to either side. 22)As per driving license of deceased, his birth date is 20/01/1983 and an accident occurred on 15/08/2015, therefore, his age would be 32 years at the relevant time. In view of Sarla Verma and ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Ors. Reported in 2009 (2) T.A.C. 677 (Supreme Court ) case, multiplier “16” is applicable. 23)Claimant has admitted during cross­examination that he has three daughters. They are married and cohabiting with their respective husbands. Therefore, married daughters cannot be depend upon deceased. Claimant no. 1 being widow and nos. 2 and 3 being parents are only dependents. Thus, in view of Sarla Verma case (Cited Supra ) there would be 1/3rd deduction. 24)Learned Advocate for the claimant argued that, deceased was permanent employee in “Torne Printers”, therefore, 12 30% future prospectus may be granted. ( Relied upon Santosh Devi Vs National Insurance Co. Ltd., & Ors. 2012 AC 226 SC ). I am of view that, the above citation is not applicable because, Torne Printers is a proprietary concern. Therefore, there is question to become permanent employee. 25)Learned Advocate for the respondent no. 1 has argued that, claimant no. 1 is widow. She has re­married after an accident. This fact is admitted by Ananda in his cross­examination and later on denied. Therefore, she is not entitled compensation. Learned Advocate of Claimant argued that, she is not re­married. If presumed, she is re­married, even though she is entitled compensation. To support his contention, he has attracted my attention towards The New India Assurance Company Vs Mona wd/o Girish @ Giridhari Chandak and others reported in [2009 AC 170 (Bom) (NB)] 170 (Nagpur Bench) , wherein Hon'ble High Court has held that, “Law does not prohibit widow from remarrying. Remarriage cannot be impediment in claiming compensation nor can it be a ground to reduce compensation to which widow is otherwise entitled ” Therefore, I am of view that, she is entitled compensation and there is no legal impediment. Considering the 13 [MACP No.625/2015] circumstances, I calculate the compensation as follows : Sr. No. Heads Calculations Rupees 1 Yearly income of deceased : Rs.7,000 p.m. X 12 = 84,000 2 1/3rd deduction as personal and living expenses : Rs. 84,000 – 28,000 =56,000 3 Compensation after applying multiplier of “16” : Rs. 56,000 x 16 = 8,96,000 4 Loss of Love & affection 1,00,000 5 Loss of consortium 40,000 6 Funeral­expenses 15,000 Total = 10,51,000/­ 26) Thus, the claimants are entitled compensation of Rs. 10,51,000 /­ (Rs. Ten Lacs and Fifty One Thousand Only). 27) The claimants have requested to grant interest @ Rs.18% per annum. I am of the view that, the said interest would be exorbitant. Instead of that, as per Kanhsingh Vs Tukaram 2015 (2) T.A.C. 689 (Supreme Court) the interest @ Rs.9% per annum would be proper and reasonable. 28) In view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Khenyei versus New India Assurance Company Limited and others. The claimant can recover the 14 aforesaid compensation from the respondents jointly and severally. Thus, I answer issue Nos. 4 & 5 accordingly and proceed to pass the following order :­ ORDER 1)The claim­petition is allowed with proportionate costs. 2)The Respondent no. 1 & 2 are held liable jointly and severally to pay the compensation. of Rs. 10,51,000/­ (Rs.Ten Lacs and Fifty One Thousand Only). to the claimants with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of petition, i.e. 28/09/2015 till realization of the entire payment, after deducting the NFL amount, if paid. 3)Out of an awarded compensation, an amount of Rs. 6,51,000/­ (Rs. Six Lacs and Fifty One Thousand Only) be given to Claimant No.1 Sadhana being widow and an amount of Rs. 2,00,000/­ (Rs. Two Lacs Only) each be given to Claimant Nos. 2 Renukabai and No. 3 Ananda being a parents of deceased. 4)Claimant nos. 4 and 5 are married sisters of deceased. They are not dependent, thus, no compensation has been awarded to them. 5)An award be drawn accordingly. Date :­ 13/12/2017 Sd/­ (C.S. Datir) MEMBER, M.A.C.T., Aurangabad. …...................

J U D G M E N T (Delivered in open court on 13/12/2017) This petition is filed by the claimants for grant of compensation of Rs.20,00,000/­ under Section 166 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. 2)Claimant's case in nutshell is as under :­ They have alleged that, an accident took place on 15.8.2015 at about 8.30 hours on Aurangabad­Ahemadnagar High way. At the time of accident, Maruti Elag was driving motorcycle. When he reached near Golwadi phata, at that time, another motorcycle bearing No. MH­20­CM­4530 came from opposite 3 [MACP No.625/2015] direction in high speed with rash and negligent manner and gave dash to him. In the accident, he sustained multiple injuries and died on the spot. 3)They have further contended that, he was shifted to Government Hospital Aurangabad. Medical Officer examined him and carried postmortem. The concerned police came on the spot, made inquiry and registered F .I.R., against respondent No.2 who was driving the motorcycle bearing No. MH­20­CM­4530. Police has prepared spot and inquest panchanama. 4)They have contended that, deceased was just 30 years old. Claimant No.1 is widow, No.2 and 3 are parents, 4 and 5 are sister of deceased. He was serving in '' Torne Printers'' CIDCO, Aurangabad and getting salary of Rs. 9,500/­ per month. He was the only earning member. Claimants are depend upon him. Due to untimely death, they are facing starvation. He was skilled employee, therefore definitely he could have get future prospectus during his service. 5)Respondent No.2 was driving the motorcycle in rash and negligent manner. He is sole responsible for the same. He is owner cum driver. The motorcycle was duly insured with respondent No.1. Therefore, both respondents are liable to get compensation. They have lastly prayed compensation of Rs. 20,00,000/­ be awarded with interest @ 18% p.a. 4 6)Respondent no 1 has filed written statement vide Exh. 21 and resisted the claim in toto. According to him, an accident did not occur due to negligence of respondent no. 2. On the contrary, deceased was driving motorcycle in rash and negligent manner and went towards wrong side. Moreover, deceased did not wear helmet and was not having license. He has breached conditions of policy. On all these grounds, claim is not tenable. 7)He has further contended that, deceased was not doing job with '' Torne Printers'' and getting salary of Rs. 9,500/­ per month, therefore, question of future prospectus does not arise. An incident occurred due to sole negligence of deceased. Moreover, claimant has not made party to the insurance company of the motorcycle of deceased. Claim is bad for non joinder of necessary parties. Claimant Nos. 4 and 5 are not dependent. They are major, therefore, they cannot be said as dependents. Moreover, there is no driving license to respondent no. 2. It amounts to breach of conditions, therefore, liability cannot be fasten against insurance company. He lastly prayed, claim may be rejected. 8)Respondent no. 2 filed written statement vide Exh. 22 and also denied allegations. He has contended that, there is no involvement of motorcycle No. MH­20­CM­4530. No accident occurred as alleged. Deceased was aged more 30 years. He was 5 [MACP No.625/2015] not serving in ''Torne Printers'' as alleged. Therefore, there is no salary as such and nobody was depend upon him. Deceased is responsible for an accident. Police has registered FIR without proper inquiry. He was holding valid and effective license and his motorcycle is insured with respondent no. 1, therefore, he is not responsible to pay compensation. In all counts, claim is not tenable and may be rejected. 9)From the rival pleadings of the parties, issues are framed and I record my findings against each of them for the reasons given below:­ Sr. No.ISSUES FINDINGS 1Do claimants prove that, an accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of motorcycle bearing No. MH­ 20­CM­4530 ?: In the affirmative. 2Do claimants further prove that, due to injuries caused in the accident Maruti Ananda Elag succumbed to death ?: In the affirmative. 3Do the claimants prove that respondent no. 1 is driver cum owner and no. 2 is insurance company of the motorcycle no. MH­20­CM­4530 ?: In the affirmative. 4Whether the claimants are entitled to get compensation, if yes, at what rate ?:As per final order. 5Who is responsible to pay compensation ?Both respondent jointly and severally. 6What order and award ? :As per final order. 6 REASONS 10)The claimants are relied upon the following documents:­ FIR (Exh.28), Spot panchanama (Exh.29), Inquest panchanama (Exh.30), P .M. report (Exh.31), RC Book of offending motorcycle (Exh.32), Insurance Policy (Exh.33), Driving license of respondent no. 2 (Exh.34), AA Form (Exh.35), salary certificate (Exh. 38), Charge­sheet (Exh. 54), Arrest panchanama (Exh. 55), M.L.C. (Exh. 56), Statement of witnesses (Exh. 57 & 58), Accident report form (Exh. 60), driving license of deceased with list Exh. 52. AS TO ISSUE NOS. 1 to 3 : 11)Issues nos. 1 to 3 are interlinked, therefore, I decide it intermingle to avoid repetitions and for court's convenience. 12)Claimants have alleged that, an accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the driver of motorcycle bearing No. MH­20­CM­4530 and the injured was expired due to injuries sustained to him. They have further alleged that, respondent no. 1 was owner cum driver of the motorcycle which was duly insured with respondent no. 2. 13)To support this contention, learned Advocate for the claimant has attracted my attention towards FIR (Exh. 28), spot panchanama (Exh. 29) accident report form (Exh. 35) and some 7 [MACP No.625/2015] statements of witnesses recorded by police. Upon perusal of complaint & FIR, it reveals that Maruti Elag was driving his motorcycle and proceeding towards Bajaj Nagar. At that time, another motorcycle bearing No. MH­20­CM­4530 came from opposite side in high speed with rash and negligent manner and gave dash to him. In the accident, he sustained multiple injuries and admitted in Government Hospital, where doctor declared as dead. 14)The concern police reached on the spot, made inquiry and registered offence against respondent no. 2 for the offence punishable under section 279, 304­A of I.P .C. As FIR lodged against respondent no. 2, it prima­facie reveals that, he would be the responsible for an accident. To fasten liability, police has recorded statement of witnesses, prepared spot panchanama and came to conclusion that, respondent no. 2 was driving motorcycle in rash and negligent manner and caused an accident. 15)Moreover, learned Advocate of Claimants has attracted my attention towards spot panchanama Exh. 29. It reveals that, an accident occurred on Ahmednagar ­ Aurangabad high way. It is sufficient wide. There are dividers. Victim was proceeding towards Bajaj Nagar. An accident occurred towards left side of the divider. It means, victim was proceeding towards his left side but the offending motorcycle of respondent no. 2 came in 8 high speed and went towards wrong side. An accident spot clearly reveals that, respondent no. 2 came towards wrong side. It supports the claimant's theory. If respondent no. 2 would have been drive his motorcycle towards his left side, an accident could have been avoided. Moreover, police has recorded statements of Kishor Nade and Akash Nikalje during inquiry. They deposed that, they were triple seat on the motorcycle of respondent no. 2. Moreover, respondent no. 2 is the eye witness. He knows how an accident took place. Even though he did not cross examine to claimant or his witness. Moreover, he did not lead evidence to support his contention. In short, whatever evidence adduced by claimant has gone unchallenged so far respondent no. 2 is concern. If really, he would have not responsible for an accident, he could have cross­ examine and lead the evidence. But he has not chosen so. Therefore, there is no hesitation to say that, an accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 2. 16)Police has prepared inquest panchanama (Exh. 30). Dead body was sent to Government Hospital, Aurangabad for postmortem. Autopsy Surgeon made postmortem. Opinion as to the cause of death is Head Injury. The driving license of respondent no. 2 is at Exh. 32. The insurance policy is at Exh. 33, AA Form is at Exh. 35, driving license of deceased is filed along 9 [MACP No.625/2015] with Exh. 52. It reveals that, respondent no. 2 was driving motorcycle no. MH­20­CM­4530 which was duly insured with respondent no. 1 and in that accident, Maruti Elag expired due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 2. 17)Learned Advocate for the respondent no. 1 (Insurance Company) has vehemently argued that, an accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of deceased and there is no fault of respondent no.2. To support his contention, he has examined respondent no. 2 as his witness. He deposed that, when he was proceeding towards Bajaj Nagar by Aurangabad – Nagar high way. At that time, he was driving motorcycle by left side. One motorcycle came from offending side and dashed to him by coming towards wrong side. I think, his evidence is not trustworthy, because, he is respondent no. 2. He is the owner cum driver of the motorcycle in question. Being respondent no. 2, why he has not examined himself and cross­examined to the claimant. This conduct goes to show that, he is trying to shift his legal liability upon insurance company. 18)Learned Advocate of respondent no. 1 has argued that, deceased did not wear helmet at the time of accident. Therefore, his contributory negligence to the extent of 30% may be held. I am of view that, police has filed charge­sheet against respondent no. 2, saying that, he was negligent at the time of 10 accident. It is not the case of police authority that, deceased was in rash and negligent manner and he is responsible for an accident. Moreover court has held that respondent no. 2 is responsible for an accident. Therefore, mere deceased did not wear helmet does not mean that, he has contributed for an accident. Thus, this defence would not be tenable. 19)Learned Advocate for the respondent no. 1 has further argued that, deceased did not have license at the time of accident. Therefore, liability to pay compensation cannot be fasten against the company. I am of view that, the claimant has filed driving license of deceased vide list Exh. 52, therefore, this defence also not tenable. Considering entire circumstances, I answer issue Nos. 1 to 3 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NOS. 3 & 4 : 20)According to claimant, deceased Maruti Elag was serving in ''Torne Printers'' at CIDCO, Aurangabad and was getting salary Rs. 9,500/­ per month. To support his contention, he has examined Shri Vishwaraj Torne a Proprietor of ''Torne Printers'' vide Exh. 37. He deposed that, Maruti Elag was working in his Printing press since 2011 as Lamination and Paunching Operator and was getting salary of Rs. 9,500/­ per month. He has also filed salary certificate vide Exh. 38. Therefore, there is no hesitation to say that, deceased was working in ''Torne Printers''. 11 [MACP No.625/2015] 21)Now question remains, how much salary he was getting. According to claimant, he was getting salary Rs. 9,500/­ p.m. The claimant has not filed bank pass book. Generally, the Proprietor gives salary certificate 20 to 25% at higher side in order to help legal heirs of deceased. The general tendency is to show sympathy towards deceased. Therefore, I am of view that, 25% salary needs to be deducted. Thus, I assessed his salary as Rs. 7,000/­ p.m. It would be more appropriate and no injustice would be caused to either side. 22)As per driving license of deceased, his birth date is 20/01/1983 and an accident occurred on 15/08/2015, therefore, his age would be 32 years at the relevant time. In view of Sarla Verma and ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Ors. Reported in 2009 (2) T.A.C. 677 (Supreme Court ) case, multiplier “16” is applicable. 23)Claimant has admitted during cross­examination that he has three daughters. They are married and cohabiting with their respective husbands. Therefore, married daughters cannot be depend upon deceased. Claimant no. 1 being widow and nos. 2 and 3 being parents are only dependents. Thus, in view of Sarla Verma case (Cited Supra ) there would be 1/3rd deduction. 24)Learned Advocate for the claimant argued that, deceased was permanent employee in “Torne Printers”, therefore, 12 30% future prospectus may be granted. ( Relied upon Santosh Devi Vs National Insurance Co. Ltd., & Ors. 2012 AC 226 SC ). I am of view that, the above citation is not applicable because, Torne Printers is a proprietary concern. Therefore, there is question to become permanent employee. 25)Learned Advocate for the respondent no. 1 has argued that, claimant no. 1 is widow. She has re­married after an accident. This fact is admitted by Ananda in his cross­examination and later on denied. Therefore, she is not entitled compensation. Learned Advocate of Claimant argued that, she is not re­married. If presumed, she is re­married, even though she is entitled compensation. To support his contention, he has attracted my attention towards The New India Assurance Company Vs Mona wd/o Girish @ Giridhari Chandak and others reported in [2009 AC 170 (Bom) (NB)] 170 (Nagpur Bench) , wherein Hon'ble High Court has held that, “Law does not prohibit widow from remarrying. Remarriage cannot be impediment in claiming compensation nor can it be a ground to reduce compensation to which widow is otherwise entitled ” Therefore, I am of view that, she is entitled compensation and there is no legal impediment. Considering the 13 [MACP No.625/2015] circumstances, I calculate the compensation as follows : Sr. No. Heads Calculations Rupees 1 Yearly income of deceased : Rs.7,000 p.m. X 12 = 84,000 2 1/3rd deduction as personal and living expenses : Rs. 84,000 – 28,000 =56,000 3 Compensation after applying multiplier of “16” : Rs. 56,000 x 16 = 8,96,000 4 Loss of Love & affection 1,00,000 5 Loss of consortium 40,000 6 Funeral­expenses 15,000 Total = 10,51,000/­ 26) Thus, the claimants are entitled compensation of Rs. 10,51,000 /­ (Rs. Ten Lacs and Fifty One Thousand Only). 27) The claimants have requested to grant interest @ Rs.18% per annum. I am of the view that, the said interest would be exorbitant. Instead of that, as per Kanhsingh Vs Tukaram 2015 (2) T.A.C. 689 (Supreme Court) the interest @ Rs.9% per annum would be proper and reasonable. 28) In view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Khenyei versus New India Assurance Company Limited and others. The claimant can recover the 14 aforesaid compensation from the respondents jointly and severally. Thus, I answer issue Nos. 4 & 5 accordingly and proceed to pass the following order :­ ORDER 1)The claim­petition is allowed with proportionate costs. 2)The Respondent no. 1 & 2 are held liable jointly and severally to pay the compensation. of Rs. 10,51,000/­ (Rs.Ten Lacs and Fifty One Thousand Only). to the claimants with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of petition, i.e. 28/09/2015 till realization of the entire payment, after deducting the NFL amount, if paid. 3)Out of an awarded compensation, an amount of Rs. 6,51,000/­ (Rs. Six Lacs and Fifty One Thousand Only) be given to Claimant No.1 Sadhana being widow and an amount of Rs. 2,00,000/­ (Rs. Two Lacs Only) each be given to Claimant Nos. 2 Renukabai and No. 3 Ananda being a parents of deceased. 4)Claimant nos. 4 and 5 are married sisters of deceased. They are not dependent, thus, no compensation has been awarded to them. 5)An award be drawn accordingly. Date :­ 13/12/2017 Sd/­ (C.S. Datir) MEMBER, M.A.C.T., Aurangabad. …...................

Mr V .C. Sarode, Advocate for Claimants. Mr R.H. Dahat, Advocate for Respondent No.1 Mr R.G. Ghode, Advocate for respondent no. 2 ....................................................................................................... J U D G M E N T (Delivered in open court on 13/12/2017) This petition is filed by the claimants for grant of compensation of Rs.20,00,000/­ under Section 166 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. 2)Claimant's case in nutshell is as under :­ They have alleged that, an accident took place on 15.8.2015 at about 8.30 hours on Aurangabad­Ahemadnagar High way. At the time of accident, Maruti Elag was driving motorcycle. When he reached near Golwadi phata, at that time, another motorcycle bearing No. MH­20­CM­4530 came from opposite 3 [MACP No.625/2015] direction in high speed with rash and negligent manner and gave dash to him. In the accident, he sustained multiple injuries and died on the spot. 3)They have further contended that, he was shifted to Government Hospital Aurangabad. Medical Officer examined him and carried postmortem. The concerned police came on the spot, made inquiry and registered F .I.R., against respondent No.2 who was driving the motorcycle bearing No. MH­20­CM­4530. Police has prepared spot and inquest panchanama. 4)They have contended that, deceased was just 30 years old. Claimant No.1 is widow, No.2 and 3 are parents, 4 and 5 are sister of deceased. He was serving in '' Torne Printers'' CIDCO, Aurangabad and getting salary of Rs. 9,500/­ per month. He was the only earning member. Claimants are depend upon him. Due to untimely death, they are facing starvation. He was skilled employee, therefore definitely he could have get future prospectus during his service. 5)Respondent No.2 was driving the motorcycle in rash and negligent manner. He is sole responsible for the same. He is owner cum driver. The motorcycle was duly insured with respondent No.1. Therefore, both respondents are liable to get compensation. They have lastly prayed compensation of Rs. 20,00,000/­ be awarded with interest @ 18% p.a. 4 6)Respondent no 1 has filed written statement vide Exh. 21 and resisted the claim in toto. According to him, an accident did not occur due to negligence of respondent no. 2. On the contrary, deceased was driving motorcycle in rash and negligent manner and went towards wrong side. Moreover, deceased did not wear helmet and was not having license. He has breached conditions of policy. On all these grounds, claim is not tenable. 7)He has further contended that, deceased was not doing job with '' Torne Printers'' and getting salary of Rs. 9,500/­ per month, therefore, question of future prospectus does not arise. An incident occurred due to sole negligence of deceased. Moreover, claimant has not made party to the insurance company of the motorcycle of deceased. Claim is bad for non joinder of necessary parties. Claimant Nos. 4 and 5 are not dependent. They are major, therefore, they cannot be said as dependents. Moreover, there is no driving license to respondent no. 2. It amounts to breach of conditions, therefore, liability cannot be fasten against insurance company. He lastly prayed, claim may be rejected. 8)Respondent no. 2 filed written statement vide Exh. 22 and also denied allegations. He has contended that, there is no involvement of motorcycle No. MH­20­CM­4530. No accident occurred as alleged. Deceased was aged more 30 years. He was 5 [MACP No.625/2015] not serving in ''Torne Printers'' as alleged. Therefore, there is no salary as such and nobody was depend upon him. Deceased is responsible for an accident. Police has registered FIR without proper inquiry. He was holding valid and effective license and his motorcycle is insured with respondent no. 1, therefore, he is not responsible to pay compensation. In all counts, claim is not tenable and may be rejected. 9)From the rival pleadings of the parties, issues are framed and I record my findings against each of them for the reasons given below:­ Sr. No.ISSUES FINDINGS 1Do claimants prove that, an accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of motorcycle bearing No. MH­ 20­CM­4530 ?: In the affirmative. 2Do claimants further prove that, due to injuries caused in the accident Maruti Ananda Elag succumbed to death ?: In the affirmative. 3Do the claimants prove that respondent no. 1 is driver cum owner and no. 2 is insurance company of the motorcycle no. MH­20­CM­4530 ?: In the affirmative. 4Whether the claimants are entitled to get compensation, if yes, at what rate ?:As per final order. 5Who is responsible to pay compensation ?Both respondent jointly and severally. 6What order and award ? :As per final order. 6 REASONS 10)The claimants are relied upon the following documents:­ FIR (Exh.28), Spot panchanama (Exh.29), Inquest panchanama (Exh.30), P .M. report (Exh.31), RC Book of offending motorcycle (Exh.32), Insurance Policy (Exh.33), Driving license of respondent no. 2 (Exh.34), AA Form (Exh.35), salary certificate (Exh. 38), Charge­sheet (Exh. 54), Arrest panchanama (Exh. 55), M.L.C. (Exh. 56), Statement of witnesses (Exh. 57 & 58), Accident report form (Exh. 60), driving license of deceased with list Exh. 52. AS TO ISSUE NOS. 1 to 3 : 11)Issues nos. 1 to 3 are interlinked, therefore, I decide it intermingle to avoid repetitions and for court's convenience. 12)Claimants have alleged that, an accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the driver of motorcycle bearing No. MH­20­CM­4530 and the injured was expired due to injuries sustained to him. They have further alleged that, respondent no. 1 was owner cum driver of the motorcycle which was duly insured with respondent no. 2. 13)To support this contention, learned Advocate for the claimant has attracted my attention towards FIR (Exh. 28), spot panchanama (Exh. 29) accident report form (Exh. 35) and some 7 [MACP No.625/2015] statements of witnesses recorded by police. Upon perusal of complaint & FIR, it reveals that Maruti Elag was driving his motorcycle and proceeding towards Bajaj Nagar. At that time, another motorcycle bearing No. MH­20­CM­4530 came from opposite side in high speed with rash and negligent manner and gave dash to him. In the accident, he sustained multiple injuries and admitted in Government Hospital, where doctor declared as dead. 14)The concern police reached on the spot, made inquiry and registered offence against respondent no. 2 for the offence punishable under section 279, 304­A of I.P .C. As FIR lodged against respondent no. 2, it prima­facie reveals that, he would be the responsible for an accident. To fasten liability, police has recorded statement of witnesses, prepared spot panchanama and came to conclusion that, respondent no. 2 was driving motorcycle in rash and negligent manner and caused an accident. 15)Moreover, learned Advocate of Claimants has attracted my attention towards spot panchanama Exh. 29. It reveals that, an accident occurred on Ahmednagar ­ Aurangabad high way. It is sufficient wide. There are dividers. Victim was proceeding towards Bajaj Nagar. An accident occurred towards left side of the divider. It means, victim was proceeding towards his left side but the offending motorcycle of respondent no. 2 came in 8 high speed and went towards wrong side. An accident spot clearly reveals that, respondent no. 2 came towards wrong side. It supports the claimant's theory. If respondent no. 2 would have been drive his motorcycle towards his left side, an accident could have been avoided. Moreover, police has recorded statements of Kishor Nade and Akash Nikalje during inquiry. They deposed that, they were triple seat on the motorcycle of respondent no. 2. Moreover, respondent no. 2 is the eye witness. He knows how an accident took place. Even though he did not cross examine to claimant or his witness. Moreover, he did not lead evidence to support his contention. In short, whatever evidence adduced by claimant has gone unchallenged so far respondent no. 2 is concern. If really, he would have not responsible for an accident, he could have cross­ examine and lead the evidence. But he has not chosen so. Therefore, there is no hesitation to say that, an accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 2. 16)Police has prepared inquest panchanama (Exh. 30). Dead body was sent to Government Hospital, Aurangabad for postmortem. Autopsy Surgeon made postmortem. Opinion as to the cause of death is Head Injury. The driving license of respondent no. 2 is at Exh. 32. The insurance policy is at Exh. 33, AA Form is at Exh. 35, driving license of deceased is filed along 9 [MACP No.625/2015] with Exh. 52. It reveals that, respondent no. 2 was driving motorcycle no. MH­20­CM­4530 which was duly insured with respondent no. 1 and in that accident, Maruti Elag expired due to rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 2. 17)Learned Advocate for the respondent no. 1 (Insurance Company) has vehemently argued that, an accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of deceased and there is no fault of respondent no.2. To support his contention, he has examined respondent no. 2 as his witness. He deposed that, when he was proceeding towards Bajaj Nagar by Aurangabad – Nagar high way. At that time, he was driving motorcycle by left side. One motorcycle came from offending side and dashed to him by coming towards wrong side. I think, his evidence is not trustworthy, because, he is respondent no. 2. He is the owner cum driver of the motorcycle in question. Being respondent no. 2, why he has not examined himself and cross­examined to the claimant. This conduct goes to show that, he is trying to shift his legal liability upon insurance company. 18)Learned Advocate of respondent no. 1 has argued that, deceased did not wear helmet at the time of accident. Therefore, his contributory negligence to the extent of 30% may be held. I am of view that, police has filed charge­sheet against respondent no. 2, saying that, he was negligent at the time of 10 accident. It is not the case of police authority that, deceased was in rash and negligent manner and he is responsible for an accident. Moreover court has held that respondent no. 2 is responsible for an accident. Therefore, mere deceased did not wear helmet does not mean that, he has contributed for an accident. Thus, this defence would not be tenable. 19)Learned Advocate for the respondent no. 1 has further argued that, deceased did not have license at the time of accident. Therefore, liability to pay compensation cannot be fasten against the company. I am of view that, the claimant has filed driving license of deceased vide list Exh. 52, therefore, this defence also not tenable. Considering entire circumstances, I answer issue Nos. 1 to 3 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NOS. 3 & 4 : 20)According to claimant, deceased Maruti Elag was serving in ''Torne Printers'' at CIDCO, Aurangabad and was getting salary Rs. 9,500/­ per month. To support his contention, he has examined Shri Vishwaraj Torne a Proprietor of ''Torne Printers'' vide Exh. 37. He deposed that, Maruti Elag was working in his Printing press since 2011 as Lamination and Paunching Operator and was getting salary of Rs. 9,500/­ per month. He has also filed salary certificate vide Exh. 38. Therefore, there is no hesitation to say that, deceased was working in ''Torne Printers''. 11 [MACP No.625/2015] 21)Now question remains, how much salary he was getting. According to claimant, he was getting salary Rs. 9,500/­ p.m. The claimant has not filed bank pass book. Generally, the Proprietor gives salary certificate 20 to 25% at higher side in order to help legal heirs of deceased. The general tendency is to show sympathy towards deceased. Therefore, I am of view that, 25% salary needs to be deducted. Thus, I assessed his salary as Rs. 7,000/­ p.m. It would be more appropriate and no injustice would be caused to either side. 22)As per driving license of deceased, his birth date is 20/01/1983 and an accident occurred on 15/08/2015, therefore, his age would be 32 years at the relevant time. In view of Sarla Verma and ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Ors. Reported in 2009 (2) T.A.C. 677 (Supreme Court ) case, multiplier “16” is applicable. 23)Claimant has admitted during cross­examination that he has three daughters. They are married and cohabiting with their respective husbands. Therefore, married daughters cannot be depend upon deceased. Claimant no. 1 being widow and nos. 2 and 3 being parents are only dependents. Thus, in view of Sarla Verma case (Cited Supra ) there would be 1/3rd deduction. 24)Learned Advocate for the claimant argued that, deceased was permanent employee in “Torne Printers”, therefore, 12 30% future prospectus may be granted. ( Relied upon Santosh Devi Vs National Insurance Co. Ltd., & Ors. 2012 AC 226 SC ). I am of view that, the above citation is not applicable because, Torne Printers is a proprietary concern. Therefore, there is question to become permanent employee. 25)Learned Advocate for the respondent no. 1 has argued that, claimant no. 1 is widow. She has re­married after an accident. This fact is admitted by Ananda in his cross­examination and later on denied. Therefore, she is not entitled compensation. Learned Advocate of Claimant argued that, she is not re­married. If presumed, she is re­married, even though she is entitled compensation. To support his contention, he has attracted my attention towards The New India Assurance Company Vs Mona wd/o Girish @ Giridhari Chandak and others reported in [2009 AC 170 (Bom) (NB)] 170 (Nagpur Bench) , wherein Hon'ble High Court has held that, “Law does not prohibit widow from remarrying. Remarriage cannot be impediment in claiming compensation nor can it be a ground to reduce compensation to which widow is otherwise entitled ” Therefore, I am of view that, she is entitled compensation and there is no legal impediment. Considering the 13 [MACP No.625/2015] circumstances, I calculate the compensation as follows : Sr. No. Heads Calculations Rupees 1 Yearly income of deceased : Rs.7,000 p.m. X 12 = 84,000 2 1/3rd deduction as personal and living expenses : Rs. 84,000 – 28,000 =56,000 3 Compensation after applying multiplier of “16” : Rs. 56,000 x 16 = 8,96,000 4 Loss of Love & affection 1,00,000 5 Loss of consortium 40,000 6 Funeral­expenses 15,000 Total = 10,51,000/­ 26) Thus, the claimants are entitled compensation of Rs. 10,51,000 /­ (Rs. Ten Lacs and Fifty One Thousand Only). 27) The claimants have requested to grant interest @ Rs.18% per annum. I am of the view that, the said interest would be exorbitant. Instead of that, as per Kanhsingh Vs Tukaram 2015 (2) T.A.C. 689 (Supreme Court) the interest @ Rs.9% per annum would be proper and reasonable. 28) In view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Khenyei versus New India Assurance Company Limited and others. The claimant can recover the 14 aforesaid compensation from the respondents jointly and severally. Thus, I answer issue Nos. 4 & 5 accordingly and proceed to pass the following order :­ ORDER 1)The claim­petition is allowed with proportionate costs. 2)The Respondent no. 1 & 2 are held liable jointly and severally to pay the compensation. of Rs. 10,51,000/­ (Rs.Ten Lacs and Fifty One Thousand Only). to the claimants with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of petition, i.e. 28/09/2015 till realization of the entire payment, after deducting the NFL amount, if paid. 3)Out of an awarded compensation, an amount of Rs. 6,51,000/­ (Rs. Six Lacs and Fifty One Thousand Only) be given to Claimant No.1 Sadhana being widow and an amount of Rs. 2,00,000/­ (Rs. Two Lacs Only) each be given to Claimant Nos. 2 Renukabai and No. 3 Ananda being a parents of deceased. 4)Claimant nos. 4 and 5 are married sisters of deceased. They are not dependent, thus, no compensation has been awarded to them. 5)An award be drawn accordingly. Date :­ 13/12/2017 Sd/­ (C.S. Datir) MEMBER, M.A.C.T., Aurangabad. …...................

Mr. K. N. Shaikh, Advocate for respondent No.1. Petition proceeded exparte against respondent No.2. Mr. S. S. Rathi, Advocate for respondent No.3. ==================================================== {2} MACP NO. 719/2015 ( Judgment) J U D G M E N T ( Delivered on 06th March, 2018 ) 1.By present petition, claimant Nikita Baban Kachre is claiming total compensation of Rs.5 lakhs in respect of permanent disability suffered by her in a motor vehicular accident under Section 166 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. 2. In brief, the case of the claimant is as under: On 11.6.2012 at about 12­00 noon, Nikita, a minor girl was standing by the side of the road near Yog Cement Company on Aurangabad – Ahemadnagar Road. At that time, one, Bolero Pick­up Van bearing registration no.MH20 AT 9221 came in a high speed and gave forceful dash to her. Because of dash, the claimant sustained injuries to her left leg, waist and other parts of body. The claimant was immediately shifted to Sahayadri Hospital, Mukundwadi, Aurangabad for medical treatment. She was treated as indoor patient from 11.6.2012 to 18.6.2012 and was operated. On 18.6.2012, father of claimant namely, Baban Kachre lodged report with Police Station, MIDC, Waluj. On the basis of it, an offence vide Crime No.33/2012 was registered against the driver of Bolero Pick­up Van bearing registration no.MH20 AT 9221 i.e. respondent no.1 for offences punishable u/S.279, 337, 338 of IPC. It is further contended by the claimant that, because of injuries sustained by her in the motor vehicular accident, she has permanent disability. The claimant further contended that, she has spent more than Rs.1 lakh for her medical treatment and she is in need of Rs.1 lakh for future medical treatment. 3.As stated in the petition, at the time of accident, the {3} MACP NO. 719/2015 ( Judgment) claimant was seven years old possessing good personality. Due to disability sustained by the claimant in the accident, future of the claimant is spoiled. It is further contended that, respondent no.2 is registered owner of offending Bolero Pick­up Van bearing registration no.MH20 AT 9221 and on the day of accident, it was insured with respondent no.3. The claimant has thus claimed total compensation of Rs.5 lakhs from respondents no.1 to 3 jointly and severally. 4. Respondent no.1, driver of the offending vehicle, filed his written statement at Exh­13 and thereby resisted the claim. Respondent no.1 denied the accident as contended by the claimant in the petition. Respondent no.1 specifically denied that, he was driving his vehicle in a rash and negligent manner. He further contended that, he was holding valid and effective driving license at the time of accident. He lastly prayed for dismissal of petition. 5.Respondent no.2, owner of the vehicle was duly served with notice of this petition, however, he failed to appear and file written statement of his defence. Hence, petition is proceeded exparte against him vide order below Exh­1 dated 4.8.2016. 6.Respondent No.3 Insurance Company filed its written statement at Exh­17 and thereby resisted the claim. At the outset, the Insurance Company has denied involvement of Bolero Pick­up Van bearing registration no.MH20 AT 9221 in the alleged accident, injuries sustained by the claimant and medical treatment given to her. Respondent no.3 further denied the mode and manner in which the accident occurred and permanent disability sustained by the claimant. In {4} MACP NO. 719/2015 ( Judgment) additional written statement, respondent no.3 Insurance Company has contended that, at the time of accident, the claimant was crossing the road and as such, she is responsible for alleged injuries suffered by her. Respondent no.3 Insurance Company further contended that, at the time of alleged accident, respondent no.1 was not holding valid and effective driving license to drive the vehicle in question and therefore, it is a breach of terms of insurance policy and on that count alone, present claim petition deserves to be dismissed against it. Respondent no.3 denied the contention that, the claimant incurred medical expenses of Rs.1 lakhs and she is in need of some amount for future medical treatment. By making such averments, Insurance Company submitted for dismissal of claim petition. 7. On the r ival pleadings of parties, following issues were framed at Exh.18. They are reproduced herein below and I have recorded my findings against each of them for the reasons stated below: ISSUES FINDINGS 1)Whether the accident took place on 11.6.2012 at about 12­00 noon on Aurangabad Nagar Road near Yog Cement Company due to rash and negligent driving of Bolero Pick­up Van bearing registration no.MH20 AT 9221 by is driver ? ...... Yes. 2)Whether the claimant sustained permanent disability due to the injury suffered by her in the said accident ? If yes, to what extent ?...... Yes, to the extent of 10%. 3)Whether the claimant is entitled to get compensation ? If yes, to what extent ?...... Yes, Rs.1,65,600/­ with interest @ 7.5 % per annum. 4)Who is liable to pay the compensation ? ...... Respondents no.1 {5} MACP NO. 719/2015 ( Judgment) to 3 jointly and severally. 5)What order? .... As per final order. REASONS 8. To substantiate contentions raised in the petition, mother of the claimant namely, Meerabai Baban Kachre examined herself as CW­1 at Exh­20. In addition to oral evidence, the claimant relied upon copy of FIR Exh­23 and Accident Report Form Comp.“AA” Exh­24. The claimant also examined Dr.Sachin Surendra Bedmutha as CW­2 at Exh­ 26 to prove Disability Certificate Exh­29. The claimant filed Pursis at Exh­31 and thereby closed her side. No evidence adduced by respondents in support of their respective contentions. The Insurance Company placed on record copy of Insurance Policy Exh­32. 9. I have heard Mr. Sk.Vazeer Patel, Ld. Advocate appearing on behalf of the claimant and Mr.S.S.Rathi, Ld.Advocate appearing for respondent no.3 Insurance Company. AS TO ISSUE NO.1: 10.Ld.Advocate for the claimant vehemently argued that, the evidence adduced by the claimant clearly establishes that, the accident in question occurred as a result of rash and negligent driving of Bolero Pick­up Van bearing registration no.MH20 AT 9221 by respondent no.1. He further submitted that, oral evidence of CW­1 Meerabai is supported by FIR Exh­23 and Accident Report Form Comp.'AA' Exh­24. There is nothing to disbelieve the oral evidence adduced by the claimant. No evidence adduced by Insurance Company to say that, the claimant herself {6} MACP NO. 719/2015 ( Judgment) was negligent in crossing the road and because of her own fault, the accident occurred. Therefore, it may be held that, respondent no.1 was negligent in driving his vehicle at the time of accident. 11.On the other hand, Ld.Advocate appearing on behalf of respondent no.3 Insurance Company submitted that, CW­1 has not witnessed the accident. Moreover, report came to be lodged after eight days of the alleged accident. He further submitted that, these undisputed facts would show that, there was no involvement of Bolero Pick­up Van bearing registration no.MH20 AT 9221 in the accident and as such, no liability can be fastened on Insurance Company. Ld.Advocate for Insurance Company has further submitted that, so far as quantum as claimed by the claimant is exorbitant. No evidence that, the claimant sustained permanent disability and therefore, compensation may not be granted to the claimant. 12.After hearing both sides and going through the averments in the pleadings and evidence of the claimant, it is seen that, there is absolutely no dispute on the point that, on 11.6.2012, the claimant sustained injuries in the accident. It is seen from Accident Report Form Comp.“AA” Exh­24 that, the claimant sustained injuries on Aurangabad – Nagar Road in a motor vehicular accident. It is further seen that, respondent no.1 was driving Bolero Pick­up Van bearing registration no.MH20 AT 9221. The said vehicle was owned by respondent no.2 and on the day of accident, it was insured with respondent no.3. It is relevant to note here that, rashness or negligence on the part of driver of the offending vehicle is a basic question for fastening liability on all respondents in as much as, it is a tortious liability based on negligence {7} MACP NO. 719/2015 ( Judgment) which entitles the claimant to get compensation and obliges respondents to pay the same. 13. CW­1 Meerabai Kachre, mother of the claimant deposed that, on 11.6.2012 at about 12­00 noon, her daughter Nikita was standing by the side of the road near Yog Cement Company. At that time, one Bolero Pick­up Van bearing registration no.MH20 AT 9221 came in a rash and negligent manner and gave forceful dash to her daughter due to which her daughter sustained serious injuries to her left leg, waist and other parts of body. Her daughter Nikita was immediately taken to Sahayadri Hospital, Mukundwadi, Aurangabad for medical treatment. She was indoor patient from 11.6.2012 to 18.6.2012 and an amount of Rs.1 lakh was incurred for her medical treatment. During cross­examination, CW­1 Meerabai admitted that, she has not witnessed the accident in question, however, said fact is not sufficient to reach to the conclusion that, the accident has not occurred as stated by the claimant. No suggestion to this witness that, the claimant was crossing the road and at that time, the accident occurred. Therefore, there is no substance in the defence raised by the Insurance Company. 14.No doubt, there is inordinate delay in lodging the FIR. The accident in question occurred on 11.6.2012 whereas report came to be lodged on 18.6.2012. During cross­examination, CW­1 has given explanation for that. When she was asked about it, she stated that, the person who committed the accident had shown his readiness to pay compensation and therefore, her husband withdrew the complaint lodged with police. It is clear from her testimony that, as compensation in respect of injury sustained by the claimant has not been paid, again on {8} MACP NO. 719/2015 ( Judgment) 18.6.2012 report came to be lodged. It is also material to note here that, respondents have not examined any witness to bring on record in rebuttal that, the accident occurred because of fault of the claimant herself and there was no involvement of Bolero Pick­up Van bearing registration no.MH20 AT 9221 in the accident. Respondent no.1 was the best witness to throw light on the manner and circumstances under which the accident occurred, however, he did not enter into the witness box. As a result of it, on the point of accident, there is sole testimony of CW­1 Meerabai coupled with contemporary record i.e. FIR Exh­23 and Accident Information Report Comp.“AA” Exh­24. 15.While appreciating evidence in such a matter, this Tribunal can rely upon the material collected by police during investigation. There are allegations of driving the vehicle in a rash and negligent manner by respondent no.1. In absence of evidence in rebuttal, inference can ultimately be drawn against driver of offending vehicle i.e. Bolero Pick­ up Van bearing registration no.MH20 AT 9221 that he was 100% negligent in driving the vehicle. In view of aforesaid discussion, I hold that, the claimant has established the factum of negligence on the part of respondent no.1 as cause of accident. Hence, I answer Issue No.1 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO.2 & 3: 16.It is the contention of the claimant that, because of injuries caused to her in the alleged accident, she suffered permanent disability which has consequently spoiled her future life. CW­1 Meerabai deposed that, her daughter Nikita sustained 13% permanent disability as per Disability Certificate issued by Dr.Sachin Surendra Bedmutha. She {9} MACP NO. 719/2015 ( Judgment) further stated that, she has incurred huge expenses to the tune of Rs.One lakh for medical treatment of her daughter and she is in need of Rs.35,000/­ for her future medical treatment. In order to grant compensation on account of permanent disability which has occurred in a motor vehicular accident, it has to be decided whether there is permanent disability to the claimant ? If yes, the extent of such permanent disability and it's effect on future life of the injured. 16.The claimant examined CW­2 Dr.Sachin Surendra Bedmutha, Orthopedic Surgeon working in Sahayadri Multispeciality Hospital, Jalna Road, Aurangabad. According to him, Nikita was treated as indoor patient from 11.6.2012 till 18.6.2012. He treated her and received an amount of Rs.32,400/­ towards medical and hospitalisation charges. He further stated that, on 2.3.2017, he examined the patient clinically and radiologically and found that, claimant Nikita had left heep gross movement restrictions. He expressed 13% permanent disability with reference to whole body. In his evidence, he proved Discharge Card Exh­27, Hospitalisation Cahrges Receipt Exh­28 and Disability Certificate Exh­29. It is seen from the cross­examination of this witness that, the Insurance Company has not challenged that, this witness has not treated the patient and not issued Disability Certificate. It has only challenged extent of disability shown in Disability Certificate Exh­29. Dr.Bedmutha stated in cross­examination that, because of increrase in age of injured, future disability can be reduced by 2 to 3%. Thus, on the basis of evidence of Dr.Bedmutha, disability with reference to whole body can be considered as 10% (Ten per cent). 17.While deciding issue no.1, negligence of respondent no.1 is {10} MACP NO. 719/2015 ( Judgment) proved. In the evidence of Dr.Bedmutha (CW­2), it has been established that, claimant Nikita sustained permanent disability, she is in need of future medical treatment and requires at least Rs.35,000/­ for future medical treatment. The claimant is aged about seven years. She has no independent source of income to consider her income for the purpose of compensation. Ld.Advocate for claimant submitted that, while ascertaining compensation, damages for mental and physical shock, future damages for amenities in life, participation in active sport, hardship, disappointment, frustration etc., will have to be taken into consideration. In support of his contention, he relied on the case in between Master Malikarjun Vs. Divisional Manager, National Insurance Company Limited reported in LAX (SC) 2013(8) 65 . In the said cited decision, the Hon'ble Apex Court observed that, while assessing compensation in case of children, appropriate compensation on all other heads in addition to actual expenses for treatment, attendance etc., should be paid on the principle of above 10% upto 30% to the whole body Rs.3 lakhs, upto 60% Rs.4 lakhs, upto 90% Rs.5 lakhs and above 90%, it should be Rs.6 lakhs. The Hon'ble Apex Court further observed that, for permanent disability upto 10%, it should be Rs.1 lakh unless there are exceptional circumstances to take it yardstick. Keeping in view the observation made by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the aforesaid authority, here in this case, the claimant is entitled to get Rs.One lakh in addition to actual expenses for treatment. 18.After considering the evidence of Dr.Bedmutha (CW­2), this Tribunal reached to the conclusion that, the disability is 10% with reference to whole body because there was fracture to left side. Dr.Bedmutha proved Hospitalisation Charges Receipt Exh­28 and stated {11} MACP NO. 719/2015 ( Judgment) that, he received Rs.32,400/­ as shown in the receipt, however, after calculating the amount shown against each particular items in the receipt, this amount comes to Rs.30,600/­. Therefore, that much amount will have to be paid to the claimant towards actual expenses for treatment though the claimant contended that, Rs.One lakh has been spent on her medical treatment. Dr.Bedmutha further deposed that, the claimant needs expenses for future medical treatment to remove implant and for that purpose, approximately an amount of Rs.35,000/­ is required. Dr.Bedmutha has no reason to depose in favour of the claimant and therefore, his evidence can be accepted. Thus, considering the material available on record, the claimant is entitled to get Rs.1 lakh for permanent disability sustained by her in motor vehicular accident, Rs.30,600/­ towards hospitalisation charges and Rs.35,000/­ towards future medical treatment including NFL amount, if any, along with interest. Hence, I answer Issues No.2 and 3 accordingly. AS TO ISSUE NO.4 : 19.Respondent no.3 Insurance Company came with a defence that, the driver of offending vehicle was not holding valid and effective driving license and therefore, there is contravention of terms and conditions of insurance policy. In order to avoid liability towards insured, the insurer has to prove that, the insured was guilty of negligence and failed to exercise care in the matter. No evidence is adduced by the Insurance Company to reach to the conclusion that, there is breach of terms of insurance policy. It is established that, because of rash and negligent driving of respondent no.1, the accident in question occurred and in the said accident, the claimant sustained permanent disability. Respondent no.1 was driving the vehicle under the authority and control {12} MACP NO. 719/2015 ( Judgment) of respondent no.2 and therefore, respondent no.2 is vicariously liable for the act of his driver. Likewise, on the principle of contract of indemnity, along with driver and owner, Insurance Company is also liable to pay compensation jointly and severally. With this, I answer Issue No.4 accordingly and pass the following order: ORDER 1)The petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs as under: 2)The claimant is entitled to get total compensation of Rs.1,65,600/­ (Rupees One lakh Sixtyfive thousand Six hundred) from respondents no.1 to 3 including no fault liability. 3) Respondent No.1 to 3 shall pay jointly and severally an amount of Rs.1,65,600/­ towards compensation (including N.F.L. amount of Rs.25,000) to the claimant with interest @ 7.5% per annum from the date of institution of claim petition i.e. from 28.10.2015 till realization of the entire amount. 4) On depositing the amount of compensation of Rs.1,65,600/­ by respondents in the Tribunal, an amount of Rs.65,600/­ be invested in fixed deposit in any nationalised bank in the name of claimant till she attains majority with liberty to withdraw interest amount quarterly if she desires and remaining amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ along with interest be paid to the claimant by issuing account payee cheque on proper identification. 5)Award be drawn accordingly.

JUDGMENT (Delivered on 26th February, 2018) ( 2 ) MACP NO. 734/15,JUDGMENT. The present application is filed by the petitioners for getting compensation as per section 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act. 2)It is contended by the petitioners that on 26­04­2015 the claimant was traveling by motor­cycle bearing no. MH­20­CJ­4143. When the motor­ cycle reached opposite LPG Gas Pump at Chikalthana Aurangabad road, the driver of Tavera Car bearing No. MH­20­BY­4789 drove the car in rash and negligent manner with high speed and gave dash to the motor­cycle of the claimant from backside. Because of this dash accident took place and the claimant sustained serious injuries on several parts of the body. She was shifted immediately to Dhoot Hospital, Aurangabad and later on to MAX hospital Aurangabad. She was indoor patient in MAX hospital. Several operations were conducted and rods were inserted in her body. When she was admitted in Dhoot hospital 26­04­2015 to 01­05­2015 relatives of the claimant incurred huge amount of Rs. 2 lakh s for medical treatment of the injured. Complaint was filed in CIDCO MIDC Police Station with respect to this accident and police after investigation registered crime for offence punishable under section 279, 337 and 338 of the Indian Penal Code against driver of the Tavera car. At the time of accident claimant was only 27 years of age. Due to said accident she sustained shock and pain and permanent disablement and she lost amenities. She was serving as Technician and she was getting income of Rs. 15,000/­ per month. Now ( 3 ) MACP NO. 734/15,JUDGMENT. she is not in a position to do any work. As she was the only earning members of their family her family members are facing for great financial crises. Respondent no. 1 is insurance company through which said car was insured. Respondent no. 3 is driver of said vehicle and respondent no. 2 is the owner of said car. Therefore, the claimant is praying for directing all the respondents to pay compensation of Rs. 6 lakhs to the claimant. 3)Respondent no. 1 appeared and filed its written statement at Exh.13. It is only admitted that respondent no. 2 is the owner of the Tavera car bearing no. MH­20­BY­4789 and respondent no. 1 is the insurer of the said car. Other contents are denied by respondent no.1. It is contended that on 26­04­2015 at about 7:15 at Chikalthana, Aurangabad road claimant was proceeding for meeting relative along with her husband and son. So the motor­cycle driver suddenly lost control over the motor­cycle and due to rash driving at one diversion motor­cycle turned turtle. Claimant sustained injuries because of that accident but only in order to get compensation under Motor Vehicle Act in collusion with her husband false complaint is filed against the alleged car driver. There is no proof of age of the claimant. Husband of the claimant was not holding valid driving license and the motor­cycle was not holding fitness certificate. Three persons were traveling at the time of incident. Motorcycle owner and insurance company of the motor­cycle are not made parties. It is denied that the claimant was ( 4 ) MACP NO. 734/15,JUDGMENT. admitted in the hospital and they incurred expenses for medical treatment. It therefore, prayed for rejecting the application. 4)Respondent nos. 2 and 3 did not appear even though served. Petition proceeded ex­parte against them. 5)The following issues were framed by my predecessor and I am recording the issues with findings for the reasons discussed below. Sr.No. Issues Findings. (1)Does the claimant prove that said accident occurred because of rash and negligent driving of respondent no.3 ? : ….In the affirmative. (2)Does the claimant further prove that she sustained permanent disability in the alleged accident ? : ..In the affirmative.. (3)Is claimant entitled for getting compensation ? If yes, upto what extent ?:..Amount of Rs. 2,82,187/­ and against respondent nos. 1 to 3. @ Rs. 9% per annum. (4)What order ? :….As per final order. REASONS 6)AS TO ISSUE NO. 1 : For support of her case, claimant examined herself on oath at Exh.21. Contents of her affidavit are as per the petition. She further deposed that she has filed on record police papers about this accident. FIR ( 5 ) MACP NO. 734/15,JUDGMENT. is at Exh. 24. Spot panchanama is at Exh.25. Charge­sheet is at Exh.26. Policy is at Exh. 27. Driving license is at Exh.28. 7)In her cross­examination she deposed that she was working as Beautician and technician and she was also doing work of tailoring. She further deposed that she is paying income tax and is ready to produce documents showing that she is income tax payer. She further deposed that she is not maintaining any record regarding her income tax. She admitted that her son aged about 13 months was also with them at that time. She further deposed that at the time of accident she was not wearing helmet. She further deposed that she cannot assign any reason as to why she has not obtained disability certificate from the Doctor who treated her. She denied that Dr. Bedmutha has issued excessive certificate of permanent disability certificate. 8)C.W .No. 2 Dnyaneshwar Pawar is working as account officer in Dhoot hospital. He deposed that claimant was admitted in Dhoot hospital from 26­04­2015 to 01­05­2015. Discharge card of the claimant is at Exh. 34. In his cross­examination he deposed that he is not receiving the payment of the bill. But their receptionist is receiving it. He also admitted that he cannot say about any of medical treatment given to the patient and the injury sustained by her. ( 6 ) MACP NO. 734/15,JUDGMENT. 9)P .W 3 Dnyaneshwar Rathod is working as Pharmacist in Dhoot hospital. He deposed that the claimant has purchased medicines of Rs. 5833/­from their medical stores. In his cross­examination he deposed that the medical stores is run by Dhoot hospital. P .W . 4 Dr. Sachin Bedmutha deposed at Exh.37. He deposed that claimant visited his hospital for obtaining disability certificate. He issued disability certificate to her. After examining her calculating the disliability as per her old case papers issued having fracture 1st to 4 ribs and anti rear and fifth rib posteriorly on 5th rib posteriorly also she had haemothorx and hemorrhage parietal region of brain due to her injuries was of symptomatic pain intermittently at rest and continuously after exertion. So he issued disability certificate showing her disability of 15%. In his cross­examination he deposed that he has not brought any certificate in court. He further deposed that he is having record about visiting his patient in hospital. He can also produce the report of radiology of this patient. He denied that he has not examined the claimant. 10)As per the case of the claimant the accident occurred because of rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 3who was driving the vehicle Tavera bearing MH­20­BY­4789. Respondent nos. 3 and 2 did not appear even though they were served so the petition proceeded ex­parte against them. The claimant has filed on record police papers regarding the ( 7 ) MACP NO. 734/15,JUDGMENT. crime filed against respondent no. 3 with respect to this accident. In the complaint which is at Exh. 24, it is mentioned that respondent no. 3 has drove Tavera Car bearing no. MH­20­BY­4789 rashly and negligently and gave dash to the motor­cycle bearing no. MH­20­CJ­4143 due to which witness including the claimant suffered injuries. Spot panchanama is at Exh. 25. It is the case of the claimant that the said Tavera Car gave dash to the motor­cycle from backside. Complaint which is at Exh. 24 is also filed in the same manner. Respondent no. 3 is absent and did not contest the petition. Therefore, adverse inference has to be brought against him. Even though according to respondent no. 1, claimant and her husband fall down on the road, at the time of turning their motor­cycle and losing the control over the motor­cycle. They also there is nothing on record to support contention of respondent no. 1. There is no oral or documentary evidence supporting this contention. On the contrary, the evidence on record shows that Tavera Car gave dash to the motor­cycle of claimant from backside. Even the spot panchanama supports this contention so the driver has not challenged the allegations against him. Hence, I found that the claimant has proved that the accident took place because of rash and negligent driving of respondent no. 3. Hence, I answer issue no. 1. in the affirmative. 11)AS TO ISSUE NO. 2 :­ ( 8 ) MACP NO. 734/15,JUDGMENT. It is the case of claimant that she sustained permanent disability in the accident. It is her case that due to accident she sustained serious injuries and so she was admitted in Dhoot hospital from 26­04­2015 to 01­ 05­2015. concerned doctor conducted operations over her and inserted steel rod. She has examined Dr. Satish Bedmutha who deposed that he has examined claimant clinically and radiologically and found that she is permanently disable upto 15 %. the disability certificate issued by him is at Exh. 38. Even though the claimant has not obtained permanent disability certificate from the Doctor who has examined her then also from the evidence of Docto r who examined her then also from the evidence of Dr.Sachin Bedmutha it can be considered tha t she was having fracture to her five ribs because of accident. It is deposed by the claimant that she was working as Teacher and Butician. As per the evidence of Dr.Sachin Bedmutha because of these injuries it is difficult for the claimant to do heavy work of Massaging of customer in the Beauty Parlor. Considering these facts, I found that the claimant has proved that because of the accident she sustained permanent disability. Hence, I answer issue no. 2 in the affirmative. 12)AS TO ISSUE NO. 3 : I have already discussed that the claimant has proved that the accident occurred because of rash and negligent driving of respondent no. ( 9 ) MACP NO. 734/15,JUDGMENT. 3 and due to the said accident she sustained permanent disability. Therefore, she is entitled for getting compensation. 13)For awarding compensation in case of accident it is necessary to consider age, income and loss of earning capacity of the claimant. For proof of age the claimant has not filed on record any documentary proof. It is her case that at the time of accident she was 27 years of age. In the charge­sheet filed against respondent no. 3 age of claimant is shown as 27 years. It is no where suggested to the claimant in cross­examination that her age was not 27 at the time of accident. Even in the discharge card of the claimant which is at Exh.33 her age is mentioned as 28 years. Hence, the age of claimant can be considered in between age group of 25 to 30 years. Claimant has deposed that she was getting Rs. 15,000/­p.m. But there is absolutely nothing on record for proof of this contentions. In her cross­examination, she deposed that she is ready to produce documents showing that she is tax payer but no such document is filed on record by her. According to her she is working as Beautician & Technician and she is also doing work of tailoring. But there is no documentary proof filed on record by her to prove these facts. Considering all these facts, her income can be considered Rs. 6000/­p.m. As per disability certificate she is suffering from 15% of permanent disability. But she has not obtained the certificate from the doctor who has treated her. Dr. Sachin Bedmutha ( 10 ) MACP NO. 734/15,JUDGMENT. deposed that due to her injuries she has symptomatic pain intermittently at rest and continuously after exertion. According to him as per her whole case papers there were fracture to her 1st to 5 ribs. Hence, it can be considered that there is loss o f 15 % of her earnin g capacity. It is argued by advocate Shri. Bhosle for respondent no. 1 that the claimant received Rs. 66,000/­ from medical claim. But there is no such evidence showing that claimant has received Rs.66,000/­ from medical claim. Not even such suggestion was given to the claimant in her cross­examination. Therefore, it cannot be considered that any amount was received by claimant due to medical claim. It is further argued by advocate Shri. Bhosle for respondent no. 1 that there were three persons traveling on the motorcycle. Because of which the motor­cycle driver lost his control over the motor­cycle and accident occurred. But the claimant has mentioned in her cross­ examination that her son who was about one year old was with them. Considering the age of son of the claimant it cannot be inferred that as there were three persons proceeding from the motor­cycle, the motor­cycle rider lost his control. So also, no suggestion was given to her in cross­ examination that the motor­cycle turned turtle on the road and so accident occurred. Considering all these facts, there is nothing on record to disbelieve the claimant. Hence, I found that the claimant is entitled for compensation. ( 11 ) MACP NO. 734/15,JUDGMENT. 14)The claimant has proved that she was admitted in Dhoot hospital for the period 26­04­2015 to 01­05­2015. C.W . 2 who is account officer of the Dhoot hospital has proved the medical bill of the hospital which is of Rs. 47,754/­ C.W . 3 Dnyaneshwar Pawar who is working as Pharmacist in Dhoot hospital has deposed on oath that the total amount of bills for the medicine purchased for the claimant is Rs. 5833/­. It can be considered that as there were fractures to the ribs of the claimant, she must have been suffered from pain. There mus be loss of amenities. Considering her injuries the arrangement of attendant must have been made for her. Hence, on these grounds, she is entitled to get Rs. 15,000/­ each i.e. total Rs. 45,000/­. Considering the loss of earning at the rate of 15%. The annual loss of earning capacity was calculated will be Rs.10,800/­. Considering age of the claimant the multiplicand will be 17 and so the final amount will come to Rs. 1,83,600/­. By adding the amount of bills i.e. Rs.53,587/­and total amount of Rs. 45,000/­ for pain, suffering loss of amenities and attendant total amount will be Rs. 2,82,187/­. 15)Respondent no. 3 was driver of the said offending vehicle. Respondent no. 2 is owner of the said vehicle and respondent no. 1 is the insurer company with which the vehicle was insured. Considering that these facts are admitted by respondent no. 1 respondent nos. 1 to 3 are ( 12 ) MACP NO. 734/15,JUDGMENT. jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the claimant. In the result, I proceed to pass the following order. ORDER (i)Petition is allowed. (ii)The Respondent nos. 1 to 3 are jointly and severally pay compensation of Rs.2,82,187/­ (Rupees two lakhs eighty two thousand one hundred eighty seven only) including NFL amount to the claimant with future interest @ Rs.9% p.a. from the date of institution of the petition till payment or realization.

No.592/2015 [Judgment] _______________________________________________ Shri K.B. Bagnawat, Advocate for claimant Petition proceeded exparte against respondent Nos. 1 and 2 Shri M.C. Mene, Advocate for respondent No.3 _______________________________________________ JUDGMENT (Delivered on : 27.07.2017) 1.This petition is filed under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 seeking compensation of Rs.3,50,000/- due to permanent disability sustained by the claimant in the motor vehicular accident. 2.Brief facts giving rise to this petition are as under :- On 10.04.2012, the claimant had been to Sillod to attend the religious ceremony at the house of his relatives. After that, he was proceeding back to Harsool, Aurangabad. When he reached at Ganori phata at about 12.30 p.m., one TATA RX-207 (pick-up van) bearing registration No. MH-20-CT-2851 (hereinafter referred to as 'the offending vehicle') came from opposite direction and gave dash to the motorcycle of the claimant. In said accident, the claimant sustained grievous injury to his right leg causing serious fracture. 3. Immediately after the accident, the claimant was 3 M.A.C.P. No.592/2015 [Judgment] admitted into Saoji Orthopedic Hospital, Aurangabad. He remained there as an indoor patient till 23.04.2012. On 21.04.2012, operation was conducted on right leg of the claimant and a rod was inserted in his leg. After discharge from Saoji hospital, the claimant was treated by Dr. P.S. Jaiswal of Jaiswal Orthopedic Clinic, Ulkanagari, Aurangabad for the period from 24.04.2012 to 01.08.2012. Dr. Jaiswal issued permanent disability certificate to the claimant assessing 20% permanent disability. 4.The police of Phulambri police station, Dist. Aurangabad registered crime No.I-75/2012 against the driver of the offending vehicle under Section 279,337,338,427 of The Indian Penal Code and under Section 134,177 of The Motor Vehicles Act. 5.The claimant was 34 years of age at the time of the accident. The claimant is a skilled worker. He is a registered plumber. During financial year 2011-12, his annual income was Rs. 1,55,700/- i.e. monthly income of Rs.12,975/-. For the financial year 2011-12, he paid Rs. 5,773/- towards income tax. However, due to the accident, the claimant was bedridden for 4 M.A.C.P. No.592/2015 [Judgment] about more than six months. Therefore, his yearly income reduced to Rs.90,708/- i.e. Rs.5,759/- per month for the financial year 2012-13. Due to the accident, working capacity of the claimant is badly affected. 6. At the time of the accident, respondent No.1 was driver, respondent No.2 was owner of the offending vehicle. Said vehicle was insured with respondent No.3. Therefore, the claimant has claimed compensation of Rs.3,50,000/- from respondent Nos.1 to 3 jointly and severally. 7.Even after service of notice, respondent Nos.1 and 2 did not appear. Therefore, the petition proceeded exparte against them. 8.Respondent No.3 filed its written statement/say at Exh. 16 and denied the contents of the petition. It is admitted that, the offending vehicle was insured at the time of the accident. However, it is contended that, the driver of the offending vehicle was not holding valid and effective driving license at the time of the accident. It is denied that, the offending vehicle was having valid fitness and permit to ply it on road. The accident occurred due to negligence of the claimant himself. There is no negligence 5 M.A.C.P. No.592/2015 [Judgment] on the part of driver of the offending vehicle. It is denied that, the claimant was 34 years of age and was earning Rs.12,975/- per month. Lastly it is prayed to dismiss the petition against it. 9.Following issues are framed at Exh. 14. I record my findings thereon for the reasons stated thereafter. ISSUES FINDINGS 1.Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of TATA RX- 207/31 bearing registration No.MH-20- CT-2851 by respondent No.1 ?In the affirmative 2.Whether the claimant sustained permanent disability due to the injuries suffered by him in said accident ?In the negative 3.Whether the claimant is entitled to get compensation ? If yes, from whom and to what extent ?In the affirmative, as per final order 4.What award ? As per final order. REASONS AS TO ISSUE NO.1 :- 10.The claimant, in support of his claim, has filed his affidavit of examination-in-chief at Exh. 19. The claimant has also examined Dr. P.S.Jaiswal (CW-2) at Exh.30, Shivshankar Kashinathappa Mitkar (CW-3) at Exh.33 and Babasaheb Kailas Jangle (CW-4) at Exh. 38. In addition to this, the claimant has 6 M.A.C.P. No.592/2015 [Judgment] filed on record certified copies of FIR (Exh.22), Spot panchnama (Exh.23),Charge-sheet (Exh.24), Statement of the claimant(Exh. 25), Insurance cover note (Exh.26), Driving license of respondent No.1 (Exh.27), Certificate of registration of the offending vehicle (Exh.28), Form Comp.AA (Exh.29), Permanent disability certificate (Exh.31) and Medical bills. 11.The claimant deposed on the line of his petition in his affidavit of examination-in-chief at Exh. 16. During his cross- examination by respondent No.3, nothing could be elicited to falsify the occurrence of the accident. The claimant denied all adverse suggestions given by Advocate for the respondent. Respondent No.1 has not entered into the witness box to prove his innocence. Concerned police investigated the case and filed charge-sheet against respondent No.1. Said charges are not challenged by respondent No.1. Registration of offence against respondent No.1 prima facie shows his negligence. Police papers filed on record are not denied by the respondent. Therefore, in absence of any contrary evidence from the side of respondent, it is held that, the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of TATA RX-207/31 bearing registration No. MH-20-CT-2851 by 7 M.A.C.P. No.592/2015 [Judgment] respondent No.1. Hence, I answer issue No. 1 accordingly in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO. 2 :- 12.In order to prove permanent disability sustained in the accident, the claimant has examined Dr.P.S. Jaiswal at Exh. 30. He deposed that, on 01.10.2013, he clinically examined the claimant and found that, the claimant sustained fracture injury below knee to his right leg. Operation was conducted for tibia fibula of right leg of the claimant. Second number toe of right foot of the claimant is amputed. Right leg of the claimant is shortened by 1 cm. Movement of right knee is decreased by 10 degree and movement of ankle is decreased by 20 degree. Accordingly, permanent disability to the extent of 20% is assessed by Mc- Bride Scale. 13.During cross-examination by learned Advocate for respondent No.3, this witness admitted that, he has not conducted radiological test of the claimant before issuing him disability certificate. This witness deposed that, the disability sustained by the claimant may cause effect on the work that he was doing prior to the accident. 8 M.A.C.P. No.592/2015 [Judgment] 14.It is pertinent to note that, the claimant during his cross-examination by learned Advocate for respondent No.3 admitted that, today also he does work of plumbing and runs his house from the income of said work. Further, the claimant in his petition has contended that, due to the accident caused on 10.04.2012, his yearly income is reduced to Rs.90,708/- for the financial year 2012-13. In the circumstances, the admissions by the claimant as well as his pleading show that, even after the accident, he was earning income from his work that he was doing prior to the accident. 15.Learned Advocate for respondent No.3 argued that, the concerned doctor who issued disability certificate to the claimant did not say about the functional disability sustained by the claimant due to the accidental injuries. The claimant has admitted that, even today he does work of plumbing and from the earning of said work, he runs his family. It means, the claimant has not sustained any functional disability due to the accidental injuries. 16.In the light of above discussion, it is not proved that, the claimant has sustained any functional disability due to the 9 M.A.C.P. No.592/2015 [Judgment] injuries sustained by him in the accident. The concerned doctor has not firmly opined that, after the accidental injuries and disability, working capacity of the claimant is affected. Hence, I hold that, the claimant has not sustained functional disability in the accident. Accordingly, I answer Issue No. 2 in the negative. AS TO ISSUE NO. 3 :- 17.The claimant in his evidence (Exh.19) deposed that, before the accident, he was doing work as registered plumber and was earning Rs.1,55,700/- during the year 2011-12. However, his annual income was reduced to the tune of Rs.90,708/- during the year 2012-13 due to the accidental injuries. The claimant has filed on record certificate of his registration as a plumber. The claimant has also filed on record certain documents showing his income. However, the claimant has not examined any witness to prove those documents on record. It is pertinent to note that, the claimant has pleaded in his petition and affidavit that, his monthly income is variable. In the circumstances, it is not proved that, the claimant was earning Rs.12,975/- per month at the time of the accident. 18.The fact of accident and involvement of TATA RX 10 M.A.C.P. No.592/2015 [Judgment] bearing registration No.MH-20-CT-2851 in said accident is proved by the claimant. It is clear from discharge cards of Saoji Hospital (Exh.34 and Exh.36) that, the claimant took treatment thereat as an indoor patient during the period 10.04.2012 till 23.04.2012. It also reveals from discharge card (Exh.37) issued by Saoji Hospital, Aurangabad that, the claimant was indoor patient thereat from 20.05.2015 to 22.05.2015. Thus, due to the accidental injuries, the claimant must have suffered pain and sufferings during the period of hospitalization. 19.The claimant has contended that, during the period of hospitalization, he incurred huge expenses for his medical treatment. In order to prove it, the claimant has examined his witness namely, Shivshankar Kashinathappa Mitkar at Exh. 33. This witness is accountant in Saoji Hospital. He deposed that, the claimant was admitted into Saoji Hospital from 10.04.2012 to 23.04.2012. He admitted that, amount of Rs.61,000/- as hospital bill (Exh.34) was received from the claimant. The claimant was again admitted into the hospital on 20.05.2015 for removing interlocking nails and was discharged on 22.05.2015. Amount of Rs.20,500/- was received from the claimant during said period of 11 M.A.C.P. No.592/2015 [Judgment] hospitalization as per the bill (Exh.35). 20.The claimant has also examined Babasaheb Kailas Jangle at Exh.38, who is a pharmacist of Madhoop Medical and Genral Stores. He deposed that, amount of Rs.46,186/- on medical bills (collectively at Exh.39) was received from the claimant for purchase of medicines by him. 21.As discussed earlier, the claimant has not proved that, he sustained functional disability due to the accidental injuries sustained by him. However, considering the period of hospitalization of the claimant, it is proved that, the claimant took treatment for a considerable period in Saoji Hospital, Aurangabad. During said period, the claimant must have suffered some pain and sufferings. He would not have been able to attend his daily routine during said period. I, therefore, find it just and proper to award lump sum amount of Rs.75,000/- for loss of injuries sustained by the claimant in the accident. In addition to this, the claimant is also entitled to amount of proved bills of Saoji Hospital amounting to Rs.61,000/-, Rs.20,500/- and amount of Rs.46,186/- towards medicines vide exhibits 34, 35 and 39 respectively. In all, the claimant is entitled to get compensation of Rs. 2,02,686/-. 12 M.A.C.P. No.592/2015 [Judgment] 22.From the police papers on record, it is clear that, at the time of the accident, the offending vehicle was owned by respondent No.2 and driven by respondent No.1. It was validly insured with respondent No.3. Therefore, respondent Nos.1 to 3 are held jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation of Rs.2,02,686/- to the claimant. Hence, I answer Issue No. 3 as mentioned against it and in answer to Issue No.4, pass following order. ORDER The Petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs as under :- 1]The respondent Nos. 1 to 3 do pay Rs.2,02,686/- (Rs. Two Lakh Two Thousand Six Hundred Eighty-six only) jointly and severally to the claimant alongwith interest @ 8% per annum from the date of the petition till its realization. 2]On deposit of compensation amount in the office of this Tribunal, it be given to the claimant by Account Payee Cheque in his name. 3]Award be drawn accordingly.

MACP No.398/2015 (Judgment) J U D G M E N T ( Delivered on 15.03.2018 ) The petitioner who was injured in the vehicular accident while riding his motorcycle No.MH­17 X­1723, has claimed just compensation under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. 2.The facts in brief of the petition are as follows; On 05.04.2015, at about 9.00 p.m. the petitioner was riding his motorcycle No.MH­17 X­1723 on Paithan ­Shegaon road. His friend Rameshwar Jadhav was the pillion rider sitting behind him. When said motorcycle had reached within the limits of Ghotan village, Bolero Pickup Jeep No.MH­16 AE­9546 coming in high speed from Shegaon side dashed said motorcycle. The petitioner and his pillion rider both being injured, the by­passers had shifted them to Rural Hospital, Shegaon and then shifted to Civil Hospital, Ahmadnagar. The petitioner was again shifted to Sahyadri Hospital, Aurangabad on 06.04.2015. On that day he had learnt that his pillion rider Mr.Rameshwar Jadhav was expired. The crime was registered against the driver of the Bolero Pickup Jeep involved in the accident in Shegaon Police Station. At the time of accident the petitioner was 22 years old working as a driver and having yearly income of Rs.72,000/­. He being became permanently disabled in resultant of injuries received in the accident, has claimed Rs.6 Lakhs as compensation so also the interest from the owner (respondent No.1), the driver (respondent No.2) and the insurance company .. 3 .. MACP No.398/2015 (Judgment) (respondent No.3) of the Bolero Pickup Jeep involved in the accident. 3.Respondent no.1­ owner vide his written statement Exh.18 has strongly opposed this claim petition. He has denied the age and the source so also quantum of income of the petitioner. Denying almost all averments of the petition, he has prayed for its dismissal with costs against him. 4.Respondent no.2­ driver vide his written statement Exh.25 has also strongly opposed this claim denying entire particulars in column No.1 to 1A of the petition. He has also denied the age and the source so also quantum of income of the petitioner. Denying almost all averments of the petition, he has prayed for its dismissal with costs against him. 5.Respondent no.3­ insurance company vide its written statement Exh.16 has denied the entire contents in para No.1 to 9 of the petition. It is specifically denied that Bolero Pickup Jeep No.MH­16 AE­9546 was involved in the accident. Alternatively, it is contended that the accident of the motorcycle of the petitioner and the said Jeep was resulted due to rash and negligent driving of the petitioner himself and not due to negligent driving of respondent No.2 who was driving Bolero Pickup Jeep No.MH­16 AE­9546. It is also contended that there was 'head on collusion' of both vehicles and there was also contributory negligence of the petitioner in happening of the said accident. It is specifically contended that there was breach of terms and .. 4 .. MACP No.398/2015 (Judgment) conditions of the policy of Bolero Pickup Jeep No.MH­16 AE­9546 (Goods carrying vehicle) as its permit and fitness were not valid and its driver respondent No.2 was not holding driving licence at the time of accident. Denying the age and the source so also quantum of income of the petitioner, it is prayed that the claim made against it be dismissed with costs. 6.In view of rival contentions of the parties, the issues were framed below Exh.23 The issues and findings thereto are as follows: SR.NO. POINTS FINDINGS 1)Whether the Claimant proves that on 05.4.2015, at about 09:00 hours, on Shegaon to Paithan road, near Dharan Shivar, within jurisdiction of Shegaon Police Station, an accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of Bolero Pick Up Jeep bearing registration No. MH­16 AE­9546? …. Yes. 2)Whether the claimant proves that he sustained permanent disability in the alleged accident? …. Yes. 3)Whether the claimant is entitled to get compensation? If yes, what should be quantum of compensation? … Yes. Rs.16,45,494/­ 4)What should be rate of interest? @ 7% p.a. 5)What order? …. The petition is allowed against respondent no.1 and 3 and dismissed against respondent no.2. .. 5 .. MACP No.398/2015 (Judgment) R E A S O N S ISSUE NO.1 : 7.The petitioner has tendered his oral evidence on affidavit (Exh.26) to prove his claim. In support of oral testimony he has produced the certified copies (Exh.28 to 30) respectively of 'AA' Form, the FIR and spot panchnama prepared during the investigation of the crime bearing C.R.No. 89/2015 registered with Shegaon Police Station. He has also produced the photocopies (Article­ A, B, C and D) respectively of the R.C. Book, the insurance policy and the fitness certificate of the Bolero pickup van so also the driving licence of its driver. 8.None of the respondents have tendered their either oral or documentary evidence to falsify the evidence of the petitioner. Both parties have filed their written arguments which are at Exh.48, 49 and 50. In addition to that their ld. Advocates have argued orally. 9.It is significant to note that the petitioner through his testimony has proved that at the time of accident he was driving the motorcycle which was proceeding on Paithan ­ Shegaon road towards Shegaon. He has denied almost all suggestions given on behalf of the insurance company, including that his motorcycle was proceeding from wrong side on the said road. He has flatly denied in cross­examination that the accident of his motorcycle and the Bolero pickup Jeep was resulted due to his rash and negligent driving. .. 6 .. MACP No.398/2015 (Judgment) 10.It is significant to note that the petitioner was not cross­ examined on behalf of respondent No.2 (driver of Bolero pickup Jeep). Therefore, whatever statements the petitioner has made regarding the negligent driving of respondent No.2 have been gone unchallenged. Not only this, but respondent No.2 has also chosen not to give his oral evidence though he was driving the said vehicle at the time of accident and was the eye witness of said accident. Having considered the contents of the FIR and the spot panchnama, this Court find the testimony of the petitioner as worthy of credit. 11.For want of rebuttal evidence on behalf of the respondents, I come to the conclusion that the petitioner has proved that the accident of his motorcycle and the Bolero pickup Jeep involved in said accident was resulted due to rash and negligent driving of respondent No.2. Hence, I answer issue No.1 in the affirmative. ISSUE NO.2 : 12.The petitioner has categorically stated before this Court that he had received grievous injuries on his person in the accident in question. To prove the percentage and nature of his permanent disability he has adduced the evidence of Dr.Sachin Bedmutha (PW2) in whose hospital he took the treatment. This witness has proved the contents of three Discharge Certificates (Colly. Exh.35) of the three periods during which the petitioner .. 7 .. MACP No.398/2015 (Judgment) was under treatment in his Sahyadri Multi Speciality Hospital, Aurangabad. He has also proved the disability certificate (Exh.38) of the petitioner. 13.On considering oral evidence of PW2 and the discharge certificates and the disability certificate issued by him, it is clearly established that the petitioner's right leg is having 48.47% permanent disability. PW2 in cross­examination has stated that the petitioner cannot fold his right knee permanently. This Court has also personally seen the condition of the right leg of petitioner in the open court. PW2 has given medical treatment including surgical to the petitioner in his own hospital. In its result, I find that the percentage of permanent disability of the right leg of the petitioner certified by him as reliable and correct. Hence, I answer issue No.2 in affirmative. ISSUE NO.3 AND 4 : 14.The petitioner has produced his driving licence (Exh.31) in which his date of birth is shown as “ 25.04.1987”. Said date makes me to believe that on the day of accident 27 years 11 months old. His driving licence clearly supports his testimony that he was the driver of motor vehicles by profession. His driving licence (Exh.31) also makes it very clear that on the day of accident he was holding said licence to drive heavy transport vehicles till 01.06.2015 and non­transport vehicles till 01.06.2032. 15.Learned Advocate Mr.Osmanpurkar has vehemently argued that .. 8 .. MACP No.398/2015 (Judgment) the petitioner has not surrendered his above mentioned driving licence to the R.T.O. which shows that his earning capacity is not at all affected. But, I find no justification in said submission as this Court has personally seen that the petitioner cannot move or fold his right leg. Considering the condition of his right leg, specially knee and he being the driver by profession, I am of the firm opinion that his working capability is affected completely to drive any motor vehicle though percentage of his said leg is certified as 48.47% by PW2. 16.The petitioner has produced four hospital bills (Colly.Exh.35). He has stated that the amounts mentioned in said bills were paid to Sahyadri Multi Specialty Hospital, Aurangabad where he took treatment as Indoor patient during four periods mentioned in the said bills. PW2 is the owner of said hospital. This witness through his testimony has proved the contents of said bills and stated that he has received total amount Rs.2,73,300/­ against four hospital bills (Colly.Exh.35) from the petitioner. Hence, the petitioner is entitled to get the said amount from respondent No. 1 and 3. 17.PW2 has stated that he had prescribed various medicines to the petitioner when he was admitted as Indoor patient in his hospital and he had purchased the same. The petitioner has produced the medicine bills (Colly.Exh.34). He has stated that vide the said bills he had purchased the medicines prescribed by PW2 for his treatment. On perusal of these bills it is .. 9 .. MACP No.398/2015 (Judgment) transpired that the petitioner had purchased medicines of Rs.43,193.92 ps. as prescribed by PW2. Hence, the petitioner is entitled to get the said amount from respondent No. 1 and 3. 18.On considering all above mentioned established facts, I proceed to make the computation of just compensation which the petitioner is entitled to receive only from respondent No.1 and 3 as follows : Computation of the compensation 1.Monthly income of the petitionerRs.6,000/­ 2.Permanent disability percentage is 48.47%, but it is assumed as 100% as he has lost his driving skill in entirety.Rs.6,000/­ 3.Yearly income of the petitioner Rs.6,000/­ x 12Rs.72,000/­ 4.Multiplicand – 17 as he was 27 years 11 months old on the day of accident.Rs.72,000/­x 17Rs.12,24,000/­ 5.Conveyance, special attendant and special diet Rs.10,000/­for each head.Rs.10,000/­x 3Rs.30,000/­ 6.Pain and sufferings. Rs. 25,000/­ 7.Hospital bills and medicine purchased bills.Rs.2,73,300/­ + Rs.43,193.92 ps.Rs. 3,16,494/­ 8.For future surgical treatments Rs.50,000/­ 9.Total compensation (total of col.4 to 8)Rs.16,45,494/­ 10.Interest. @ 7% p.a. .. 10 .. MACP No.398/2015 (Judgment) In view of the above mentioned computation, I hold that the petitioner is entitled to get Rs.16,45,494/­ as just compensation under pecuniary and non­pecuniary heads only from respondent no.1 and 3 with interest @ 7% p.a. from the date of the application till its realization and costs. Accordingly, I answer issue No.3 and 4 and pass the following order : O R D E R 1)The application is allowed with costs against respondent no.1 and 3 and dismissed with costs against respondent no.2. 2)Respondent no.1 and 3 shall jointly and severally pay Rs.16,45,494/­ inclusive of NFL amount, with interest @ 7% p.a. from the date of the application till realization of entire amount, to the petitioner within two months from today by Demand Draft/cheque issued in his name. 3)The petitioner shall pay court fees, if any required. 4)The Award be drawn up accordingly.

Khedkar – Advocate for claimant Mr.P.S. Mehta – Advocate for Respondent No.1 Mr.S.V. Kulkarni – Advocate for Respondent No.2 ******************************************* J U D G M E N T [Delivered on this 7th day of October, 2017] 2 1]Claimant has filed this claim petition under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act as against respondents for claiming Rs.5,00,000/­ towards compensation accordingly. 2]In nutshell, the facts of claimant's case can be summarized as follows :­ It is the case of the claimant that, claimant Rupesh s/o Asaram Gangave, aged about 14 years is minor son under guardianship of his father Asaram s/o Harsing Gangave. On 19.10.2015 at about 8.00 am minor claimant Rupesh was going to attend the nature's call from his residence. That time one motorcycle bearing registration no. MH­20­CN­7670 came on the road side of Cambridge school to Beed bye­pass road in a high and excessive speed. Due to rash and negligent driving his motorcycle / offending vehicle dashed to the injured Rupesh. Injured / claimant Rupesh sustained head injury, fracture to right leg and right chest. He was immediately shifted to MGM Hospital, Aurangabad for medical treatment. He was indoor patient from 19.10.2015 to 28.10.2015. During that period the concerned doctor had conducted several operations over injuries of the claimant and inserted rod in right leg. Further, he is under treatment as an outdoor patient. The medical expenditure of Rupesh Vs. Sk.Aavej & anr. 3 Judgment – MACP No.732/2015 Rs.1,00,000/­ as incurred by the claimant's father towards hospitalization charges, doctor fees, medicines, x­ray, MRI's, traveling expenses and special diet. 3]Thereafter police authority of police station MIDC­ CIDCO registered the crime vide Crime No. I­410/2015 under section 279, 338 and 339 of the IPC. Injured – victim Rupesh was 14 years old on the date of accident and he was student, taking education. Further, he also used to extend help to his father for the vegetable selling business. The income of the injured was Rs.15,000/­ pm. Due to accidental injuries, victim became permanent handicapped and unable to do his day to day work, and also not in a position to work and earn in future. 4]Respondent No.1 is owner and driver of the offending vehicle bearing registration no. MH­20­CN­7670. Respondent No.2 is the insurance company. The offending vehicle was insured with insurance company – Respondent No.2 on the date of accident vide insurance policy for the period 21.06.2015 to 20.06.2016. As such the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation of Rs.5,00,000/­ to the claimant. 4 Lastly, claimant submitted to allow his claim and award Rs.5,00,000/­ towards compensation with 18% interest per annum. 5]In response to the case of the claimant, Respondent no.1 appeared and filed his detailed say / written statement vide exh.26. It is contended by Respondent No.1 that, there is no iota of truth in this case. Respondent No.1 denied that, the offending vehicle owned by him has caused the accident and also denied the facts that, he had rashly and negligently driven the offending vehicle on the date of accident. According to Respondent No.1, false FIR has been lodged against him though there was no fault. Respondent No.1 also denied the earning of claimant. Respondent No.1 admits that, the offending vehicle was driven by him and owned by him. According to him, the offending vehicle was covered the insurance for the period from 21.06.2015 to 20.06.2016, insured with Respondent No.2. According to Respondent No.1, he was having a valid and effective driving licence to drive the said vehicle on the date of accident. Lastly, Respondent No.1 denied the entire claim of the claimant and submitted to dismiss the claim with costs. Rupesh Vs. Sk.Aavej & anr. 5 Judgment – MACP No.732/2015 6]Respondent no.2 insurer has filed its detailed say / written statement vide exh.17. Respondent No.2 – insurance company has denied the entire claim of the claimant, and also denied the age, income of the injured / victim for want of knowledge. Further, it is contended that, the claimant is minor and therefore, question of income does not arise. As the owner of the offending vehicle did not inform to the insurer about the alleged accident dated 19.10.2015, hence, the fact of accident is denied. Respondent – insurance company also denied about the alleged injury sustained by victim in an accident. Further, it is contended that, the offending vehicle – motorcycle was not insured with Respondent – insurance company at the time of accident. Respondent – insurance company further denied about the medical expenditure of the claimant – victim. Injured – victim has not taken proper care of road. Hence, insurance is not liable to pay any compensation. No financial loss has been caused to the claimant and he further did not suffer permanent disability. As there was no valid and effective driving licence of the driver of the offending vehicle on the date of accident, as such it is clearly breach of terms and conditions of policy. Therefore, Respondent – 6 insurance company is not liable to pay the compensation. Claimant and the vehicle owner have filed this false claim in collusion with each other. Lastly, the respondent – insurance company submitted to dismiss the claim with costs. 7]Considering the facts and circumstances, rival contents and pleading of both parties, I have framed the issues vide exh.27. The issues are being reproduced as follows, and I have recorded my findings thereon with reasons accordingly are as follows :­ ISSUES FINDINGS 1]Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the motor vehicle bearing registration No. MH­20­CN­7670 driven by respondent no.1?In the affirmative. 2]Whether the claimant sustained permanent disability due to the injuries suffered by him in the said accident ? If yes, to what extent ? Yes, 18%. 3]Whether the claimant is entitled to get compensation amount ? If yes, to what extent ? Yes, Rs.2,18,893/­ only. 4]Who is liable to pay compensation ? As per final order . 5]What order and award ? As per final order. R E A S O N S Rupesh Vs. Sk.Aavej & anr. 7 Judgment – MACP No.732/2015 AS TO ISSUE NO.1 :­ 9]Heard argument of learned counsel Mr.P.B. Khedkar for the claimant, argument of learned counsel Mr.P.S. Mehta for Respondent No.1 – owner and driver and also heard argument of learned counsel Mr.S.V. Kulkarni for respondent no.2 – insurer at length. Also perused and read the notes of argument filed on behalf of Respondent No.2 vide exh.58. Perused the record and proceeding carefully. 10]In order to establish and prove the claim, the claimant had led evidence by examining witness no.1 Shri Asaram s/o Harsing Gangave at exh.28, who is the father of the minor victim – injured – Rupesh. Further, the claimant has adduced the oral evidence of witness no.2 i.e. victim / injured – Rupesh s/o Asaram Gangave at exh.43. Further, the claimant has examined and adduced oral evidence of witness no.3 Rameshwar s/o Vithhalrao Mandave at exh.44 – Cashier of MGM Hospital, just to prove the medical hospital bill vide exh.46. PW4 Avinash s/o Bhaskarrao Borde, Pharmacists vide exh.47, just to prove the medical bills vide exh.49. PW5 Dr.Sachin Surendra Bedmutha at exh.50. His evidence is just to prove the disability certificate at exh.51. 8 11]The claimant relied on documentary evidence i.e. true copy of FIR exh.31, spot panchanama exh.32, true copy of complaint of complainant Rupesh vide exh.33, true copy of application of I.O. to the Medical Officer for permission to take statement of complainant vide exh.34, true copy of MLC informant vide exh.35, discharge card of the injured Rupesh issued by MGM Hospital authority at exh.36, true copy of AA Form vide exh.37, true copy of driving licence of Respondent No.1 vide exh.38, copy of aadhar card of claimant no.1 vide exh.39, insurance policy of offending vehicle exh.40, certificate of registration of offending vehicle exh.41, medical bills of Rs.3,260/­ vide exh.46, the medical bills collectively marked as exh.49, which are at serial nos.3 to 12 below list of documents exh.4. 12]The disability certificate as proved in the evidence of PW5 Dr.Sachin Surendra Bedmutha vide exh.51 and certificate about the future medical expenses of the victim / injured Rupesh of Rs.35,000/­ vide exh.52. 13]Claimants have filed the evidence close purshis vide exh.53. Respondent No.1 without examining any witness have filed purshis vide exh.55 mentioning therein that, he does not Rupesh Vs. Sk.Aavej & anr. 9 Judgment – MACP No.732/2015 want to lead any evidence and closed his evidence. Furthermore, the insurance company – respondent no.2 also closed evidence vide purshis exh.56 without examining any of the witness. 14]During the course of argument learned counsel Shri P.B. Khedkar relied on the following rulings :­ 1}The New India Assurance Co.Ltd. Vs. Shweta Dilip Mehta & others (Bombay High Court) 2010(4) ABR (NOC) 411 (Bom.) ­on the point of compensation to be awarded in the event of minor victim 11 years and for applying the proper multiplier. 15] On the other hand, learned counsel Shri S.V. Kulkarni for the Respondent No.2 – Insurance company relied on following rulings :­ 1}Benny Fernandes Vs. John Agnelo Fernandes & anr. II (2006) ACC 58 (Bombay High Court) ­on the point of burden to prove rash and negligence on the claimant. 2]Laxman Vithoba Gaunkar Vs. Sudesh s/o Nand Gaunkar and others 2011(1) Mh.L.J. 845 (Bombay) ­on the point of claimant to establish rashness and negligence on the part of driver of the offending vehicle. I have gone through the aforesaid record including oral and 10 documentary evidence as led by the claimant side. Also gone through rulings relied and cited by both the sides as the best guidelines for me to decide the claim. 16]Claimant side i.e. in oral evidence of PW1 Asaram s/o Harsing Gangave and his son Rupesh injured PW2 and considered the entire police case papers i.e. spot panchanama, copy of FIR, complaint of complainant Rupesh, it is evident that, the offending vehicle – motorcycle no. MH­20­CN­7670 was being driven by Respondent No.1 Shaikh Aavej and he is the owner and driver of the said vehicle. This fact also is not in dispute. 17]Further, it is admitted fact that, Respondent No.1 is owner and driver / rider of offending vehicle no. MH­20­CN­7670, Respondent No.2 is the insured of the offending vehicle and the offending vehicle is insured with insurance company. 18]Now from the police case papers on record as coupled with the oral evidence of victim / injured PW2 Rupesh Asaram, PW1 Asaram, it goes to prove that, Resondent No.1 – Shaikh Aavej has driven rashly and negligently his motorcycle – offending Rupesh Vs. Sk.Aavej & anr. 11 Judgment – MACP No.732/2015 vehicle, dashed to the victim Rupesh, 14 years old, is the son of PW1 Asaram Gangave. 19]No doubt, Respondent No.1 – Shaikh Aavej has been prosecuted by the police authority of the police station MIDC­ CIDCO vide Crime No.410/2017 under section 279, 338 and 339 of the IPC as FIR came to be registered against him. The spot panchanama also reveals that, Respondent No.1 was rash and negligent while driving the motor vehicle. 20]As per the spot panchanama further it reveals that, the offending vehicle as driven by Respondent No.1 bearing registration no. MH­20­CN­7670 was involved. Form AA exh.37 also shows that, the driver and owner of the offending vehicle is Respondent No.1 namely Shaikh Aavej and the offending vehicle is insured. 21]As such it is proved at all that, Respondent No.1 had driven rashly and negligently his motorcycle – offending vehicle and gave dash to the injured Rupesh. Moreover, Respondent No.1 did not step into the witness box to give his oral evidence as well as no evidence from both the respondents in rebuttal. As such 12 adverse inference can be drawn as against respondent no.1 – driver of the offending vehicle that, he was rash and negligent while driving the offending vehicle. In such circumstances issue no.1 is proved at all hence, I answer issue no.1 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NOS.2 AND 3 :­ 22]In view of the finding to issue no.1 it is well established that, due to rash and negligent driving of Respondent No.1 by driving the offending vehicle no. MH­20­CN­7670, the accident occurred and as a consequence thereof the claimant sustained injuries. As such the claimant is entitled to get the compensation under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act. 23]Just to calculate and ascertain the compensation amount Tribunal has to consider the age and income of the injured. In the instant case victim / injured Rupesh is 14 years old, his age is sown in the spot panchanama exh.32, FIR exh.31 and in the statement of Rupesh vide exh.33 and letter of MLC vide exh.35, discharge card exh.36. As such I hold that, the age of the injured Rupesh was 14 years on the date of accident. 24]Now point remains about the income of the injured / Rupesh Vs. Sk.Aavej & anr. 13 Judgment – MACP No.732/2015 victim Rupesh. No doubt, claimant / injured Rupesh is 14 years old on the date of accident and he is school going boy as admitted by the PW1 and PW2 Asaram and Rupesh. PW1 Asaram in his evidence deposed that, claimant / injured Rupesh used to help him in his vegetable selling business work and victim is earning Rs.15,000/­ per month. 25]Learned counsel Shri P.B. Khedkar in his argument submits that, business of Asaram PW1 is Vegetable Vendor and victim Rupesh used to assist him at his shop. Hence, submitted to consider the income of the victim Rupesh as Rs.15,000/­ per month. 26]I do not agree in this regard. As such there is no exact and documentary evidence about the net earning of the victim Rupesh. As such now I am constrained to consider the notional income of the injured Rupesh, in absence of fixed income of the injured. As such Rs.4,500/­ per month notional income can be considered, as per the ruling of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ramchandrappa Vs. Manager, Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Company Ltd. 2011(4) T.A.C. 1 (S.C.) . 27]Further, I would like to mention here that, as pe rthe 14 ruling of Smt.Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another reported in 2009(2) T.A.C. 677(S.C.) up to 15 years there wold be no multiplier applicable. But, age of the victim / injured is 14 years i.e. near about 15 years. Learned counsel Shri P.B. Khedkar for the claimant relied on the ruling of Hon'ble Bombay High Court, The New India Assurance Co.Ltd. Vs. Shweta Dilip Mehta & others cited supra, wherein it was observed that, victim was 11 years of age at time of accident and proper multiplier would be 18. Further, the Hon'ble Bombay High Court has also referred and relied the ruling (1996) 4 SCC 362. Therefore, in the circumstances in the instant case also multiplier can be considered as 18. 28]Therefore, considering the multiplier and income of the injured the calculation is made as under :­ Notional income ­Rs.4,500/­ x 12 months ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­ TotalRs.54,000/­ pa x 18 multiplier ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­ Rs.9,72,000/­ Therefore, the loss of income comes to Rs.9,72,000/­. Rupesh Vs. Sk.Aavej & anr. 15 Judgment – MACP No.732/2015 29] As per the oral evidence of PW5 Dr.Sachin Surendra Bedmutha at exh.50 and the permanent disabilities certificate as issued by him at exh.51, the disability is to the extent of 18%. Therefore, 18% of the loss of income of Rs.9,72,000/­ comes to Rs.1,74,960/­. 30]As per oral evidence of PW4 Avinash Borde at exh.47, the medical bills exh.49 collectively marked as serial nos.3 to 12 is proved at all therefore, claimant is entitled for the medical bill amounting to Rs.3,932.78ps., rounded as Rs.3,933/­. 31]Further, towards pain and suffering claimant is entitled for Rs.5,000/­. As per oral evidence of claimant as well as the evidence of PW5 Dr.Sachin Surendra Bedmutha and the certificate issued by PW5 Dr.Sachin Bedmutha, the said PW5 Dr.Sachin Bedmutha deposed that, towards future expenses, for an operation in the form of implant removal, the estimated costs of future medical expenses for the injured is Rs.35,000/­, but it may be in future. However, an amount of Rs.35,000/­ towards future medical expenses can be awarded for the future medical expenses to the injured / claimant Rupesh. Hence, claimant is entitled 16 accordingly. 32]I again reiterated that, an amount of Rs.1,74,960/­ towards pecuniary and non­pecuniary pain and suffering Rs.5,000/­ + medical bills of Rs.3,933/­ as well as Rs.35,000/­ towards future medical expenses = Rs.2,18,893/­. This much amount can be awarded to the claimant / injured, which comes to Rs.2,18,893/­ with 9% interest – as per the ruling of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Smt.Neeta w/o Kallappa Kadolkar and others Vs. The Divisional Manager, MSRTC, Kolhapur, 2015(1) T.A.C. 340 (S.C.) . In the circumstances issue nos.2 and 3 proved at all hence, I answered issue nos.2 and 3 in the affirmative accordingly. AS TO ISSUE NOS.4 AND 5 :­ 33]No doubt, the offending vehicle is insured with Respondent No.2 – insurance company vide policy exh.40 in respect of the insurance policy. It is valid from 21.06.2015 to 20.06.2016. The accident has taken place on 19.10.2015. As such it covers risk and liability. As such I hold that, an amount of Rs.2,18,893/­ shall be paid by both the respondents jointly and severally to the claimant. In the circumstances the claim of the Rupesh Vs. Sk.Aavej & anr. 17 Judgment – MACP No.732/2015 claimant deserves to be allowed partly with proportionate costs. As such I answer issue no.4 accordingly and proceed to pass the following order :­ ORDER 1]The claim petition of the claim petitioner is hereby allowed partly with proportionate costs as follows:­ 2]Both the Respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation of Rs.2,18,893/­ to the claimant with 9% interest from the date of filing of this claim petition till its full realization, including NFL amount of Rs.25,000/­. 3]The claimant – Rupesh Asaram Gangave is minor, therefore, an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ shall be kept in fixed deposit scheme of any nationalized bank in his name, till he attains age of majority and rest of the amount shall be paid to the claimant i.e. his father – Asaram s/o Harsing Gangave being a guardian on behalf of the minor injured Rupesh s/o Asaram Gangave by account payee cheque. 4]Award be prepared accordingly.

Pathan & Mr.A.Z. Biyabani – Advs. for claimants Ex parte against Respondent Nos.1 and 2 Mr.S.S. Rathi – Advocate for Respondent No.3 ********************************************** J U D G M E N T [Delivered on 5th day of October, 2017] 1]Claimants have filed this claim petition under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act for claiming compensation of Rs.30,00,000/­ as against the respondents. 2]In brief, facts of claimants case can be summarized as follows :­ Vazirmiyan & ors. Vs. MS Deepti & ors. 3 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 It is the case of the claimants that, deceased Siraj Vazirmiyan Deshmukh was the son of claimant no.1 and claimant no.2. Claimant no.3 Raziya is the widow of deceased Siraj Vazirmiyan Deshmukh. Rest of the claimants no.4 to 8 are the children of the deceased Siraj Vazirmiyan Deshmukh. They all are the dependents of the deceased. 3]On 18.10.2014 deceased Siraj Vazirmiyan Deshmukh was proceeding by driving motorcycle bearing no. MH­20­BD­9268 from Ajanta to Golegaon. At the same time one Tata Safari jeep bearing No. MH­12­HN­0102 came from opposite side in wrong side in high speed and gave dash to the motorcycle of the deceased. As such the accident has taken place. Deceased Siraj Vazirmiyan Deshmukh was admitted to Government Medical College and Hospital at Sillod. The doctor has examined deceased Siraj Vazirmiyan Deshmukh and declared him as dead. His motorcycle was also damaged. 4]The police authority of police station Ajintha had registered a crime bearing Crime No. I­140/2014 under section 279, 337, 338, 304(A) of the IPC and 134/177 of the Motor Vehicles Act as against the driver of Tata Safari jeep – the 4 offending vehicle. Respondent No.2 was the driver of the offending vehicle. Respondent No.1 was the owner of the offending vehicle. The said offending vehicle was insured with Respondent No.3. That policy was valid from 02.01.2014 to 01.01.2015. 5]The postmortem was conducted by the concerned Medical Officer. At the time of accident the deceased was 40 years old. His monthly income was Rs.2,00,000/­ from grocery shop and the other business – transportation as he owned his Tata 407 Matador bearing No. MH­20­B­3212 and loading Ape­Rickshaw bearing No. MH­20­AT­7443. Deceased was the earning hand in his family and he used to maintain all the claimants being Karta of his family. All the claimants have lost their shelter, love and affection, etc. As such all the claimants claimed Rs.30,00,000/­ to the respondents under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act. All the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the said compensation to the claimants. Lastly, they submitted to allow the claim with costs as against respondents. 6]Respondents no.1 and 2 duly served vide public notice in daily newspaper vide exh.17 but they failed to appear hence, case proceeded ex parte against them. Vazirmiyan & ors. Vs. MS Deepti & ors. 5 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 7]Respondent No.3 is the insurer. Insurer appeared and filed its detailed say and written statement vide exh.13. Respondent – insurance company had denied the age, income of the deceased for want of knowledge. Even the insurance company – respondent denied regarding the status of the respondent as a insurer of Tata Safari – offending vehicle No. MH­12­HN­0102. Further, respondent – insurance company denied the rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle at the hands of Respondent No.2. Further, respondent – insurance company denied about the damage of the motorcycle of the deceased. It is contended by the insurance company that, the claim is not at all tenable. 8]According to Respondent – insurance company deceased was driving his motorcycle in rash and negligent manner, caused the accident and he is solely responsible for his death. Respondent – insurance company denied the liability to indemnify the owner of the offending vehicle as the driver of the offending vehicle was not having valid and effective driving licence. There is a fundamental breach of contract of insurance. Hence, claim deserves to be dismissed as against the insurance company. The 6 spot panchanama is suspicious. Lastly, the insurance company has denied the claim and resisted strongly and submitted to dismiss the same. 9]Considering the rival contentions and pleadings of both the parties, my learned predecessor framed issues at exh.18 which are being reproduced as follows, I record my findings with reasons thereon as follows :­ ISSUES FINDINGS 1]Whether petitioners prove that, on 18.10.2014 at about 2.00 pm the accident had taken place on Ajantha – Golegaon road, in front of Khandala phata, within the jurisdiction of Ajantha police station due to rash and negligent driving of the offending driver of Tata Safari Jeep bearing registration No. MH­12­HN­0102 ? In the affirmative. 2]Whether petitioners further prove that, in the above said accident, deceased ­ Siraj Vazirmiyan Deshmukh died in the said accident ?In the affirmative. 3]Whether the petitioners are entitled to get compensation ? If yes, what rate and at what quantum ? Yes, Rs.14,73,000/­. 4]Who is liable to pay compensation ? As per final order . 5]What order ? As per final order. R E A S O N S 10]Heard argument of learned counsel Mr.A.Z. Biyabani for the claimants and learned counsel Mr.S.S. Rathi and Mr.S.S. Vazirmiyan & ors. Vs. MS Deepti & ors. 7 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 Tithe for Respondent No.3 – insurance company at length. No response from Respondents no.1 and 2 i.e. owner of the offending vehicle and driver of the offending vehicle as case proceeded ex parte against them. AS TO ISSUES NO.1 AND 2 :­ 11]In order to substantiate the claim, the claimants have adduced the evidence of claimant no.1 – Vazirmiyan Ganimiyan Deshmukh – father of the deceased vide exh.19, who is testified as he has been cross examined at length. 12]Claimants have relied on documentary evidence. Those are certified copy of FIR at exh.25, spot panchanama exh.26, inquest panchanama exh.27, provisional postmortem notes at exh.28, receipt handing over the dead body at exh.29, insurance policy at exh.30, receipt of insurance premium at exh.31, AA Form exh.32, driving licence of deceased at exh.33. 13]No doubt, the oral evidence of CW1 – father of the deceased is nothing but reproduction of the total contents of the exh.1. Moreover, in support of claim claimants have also adduced the oral evidence of CW2 Lalit s/o Rajendra Khandelwal at exh.35. 8 Second witness is the witness to prove that, the deceased was his customer and wholesale dealer regarding grocery shop. In his evidence CW2 stated that, the bills issued by his shop New Tirupati Traders in the name of deceased Siraj Deshmukh. Those are marked at Exh.36 collectively. He was also testified. But, from the oral evidence of CW1 and 2 the quantum of the exact income of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh is not proved at all. 14]Now no doubt, from the police case papers as aforesaid including the FIR, spot panchanama, inquest panchanama, postmortem report, Form AA, it is crystal clear and goes to prove that the deceased Siraj Deshmukh had died in motor vehicle accident. Moreover, from the police case papers it reveals and goes to prove that, Respondent No.1 was the owner of the offending vehicle – Tata Safari beraing No. MH­12­HN­0102 and Respondent No.2 Samratsingh Khutal was the driver of the offending vehicle. From all the police case papers i.e. postmortem report, inquest panchanama, etc. it is proved that the deceased had expired in an accident. Cause of death as per postmortem is – cardio­respiratory arrest is due to multiple fracture and head injury and hemorrhage shock. Due to road traffic accident. Vazirmiyan & ors. Vs. MS Deepti & ors. 9 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 15]Claimants have led their oral and documentary evidence. On the other hand, Respondents No.1 and 2 did not appear and contest the case and case proceeded ex parte against them. As such the adverse inference can be proved against Respondent No.2 – driver of the offending vehicle that, he has driven the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused accident, death of the deceased. 16]No doubt, the insurance policy vide exh.30 on record reveals that, the offending vehicle no. MH­12­HN­0102 was insured with Respondent No.3 for the period from 02.01.2014 to 01.01.2015. The accident had taken place on 18.10.2014. As such this policy covers the risk and liability of the Respondent No.3 – insurance company. 17]However, the respondents did not step into the witnss box. No evidence is led by the respondents side. Considering all these facts and circumstances and considering the oral and documentary evidence as led by the claimants side, I am of the firm view that, the motor vehicle accident has taken place in respect of the offending vehicle wherein the deceased Siraj Deshmukh had expired. As such issue nos.1 and 2 proved at all hence, I answer issue nos.1 and 2 in the affirmative. 10 AS TO ISSUE NOS.3 AND 4 :­ 18]In view of the findings to issues nos.1 and 2 certainly all the claimants are entitled to claim the compensation under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act as against respondents. As such all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, to the claimants. 19]Now the question remains about quantum of the compensation amount to be ascertained, determined. So as to determine the quantum of the compensation, Tribunal has to consider the age, income of the deceased. From the pleadings, oral evidence and documentary evidence as led by the claimants side, the age of the deceased on the date of accident was 40 years and 6 months. There is driving licence of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh vide exh.33 in which the date of birth of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh is mentioned as 10.04.1974. The accident has taken place on 18.10.2014. As such it is established that, the age of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh on the date of accident was 40 years 6 months. Vazirmiyan & ors. Vs. MS Deepti & ors. 11 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 20]In view of the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Smt.Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another reported in 2009(2) T.A.C. 677(S.C.) = 2009(2) T.A.C. 677 the multiplier on considering the age of the deceased must be considered, applied as 15. 21]However, the main question remains about the actual income of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh. As per the case of the claimants and oral evidence of CW1 Vazirmiyan Deshmukh, the net income of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh from the wholesale grocery shop and from the transportation business of two motor vehicles owned by deceased Siraj Deshmukh was Rs.2,00,000/­ per month. But, considering the entire oral and documentary evidence of the claimants side on record, it is nowhere proved and established that, the deceased Siraj Deshmukh's income was Rs.2,00,000/­ per month. 22]In the evidence of CW1 and 2 Vazirmiyan Deshmukh and Lalit Khandelwal, they have deposed that, the deceased was the businessman having its own business of grocery shop. In the evidence of CW2 Lalit Khandelwal as deposed that, the deceased Siraj Deshmukh was his regular customer and he used to purchase 12 the grocery articles from his shop worth Rs.40,000/­ to Rs.45,000/­ at one time. But, on record there is no exact proof about the income of the deceased. As such I have no alternative than to consider the notional income. In the circumstances as per the case of Ramchandrappa Vs. Manager, Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Company Ltd. 2011(4) T.A.C. 1 (S.C.) Rs.4,500/­ can be considered as monthly income of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh on the date of accident. 23]No doubt, in all there are eight dependents i.e. claimants. As such 1/5th deduction can be considered out of the income of the deceased towards personal and living expenses. Therefore, the claimants are entitled for the compensation as under :­ Notional income ­Rs.4,500/­ ­ x 12 months ========= Rs.54,000/­ p.a. Deduction 1/5th ­(minus) Rs.10,800/­ ========= Total Rs.43,200/­ x 15 (multiplier) ========= Rs.6,48,000/­ ========= Therefore, the loss of dependency comes to Rs.6,48,000/­. Vazirmiyan & ors. Vs. MS Deepti & ors. 13 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 24]In view of the ruling of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Smt.Neeta w/o Kallappa Kadolkar and others Vs. The Divisional Manager, MSRTC, Kolhapur 2015(1) T.A.C. 340 (S.C.) ­ the claimants are entitled for Rs.25,000/­ towards funeral expenses, Claimant no.3 – Raziya – widow of the deceased is entitled for Rs.1,00,000/­ towards loss of consortium, I award Rs.1,00,000/­ to the parents of the deceased i.e. claimant nos.1 and 2 towards loss of love and affection. Further, I award Rs.1,00,000/­ towards loss of estate. Further, I award Rs.1,00,000/­ each to the minor children i.e. claimant nos.4 to 8 towards love and affection. 25]Further, in view of the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Smt.Neeta w/o Kallappa Kadolkar and others cited supra 9% interest can be awarded over the compensation amount from the date of filing of claim petition till its realization. 26]Claimants have relied on the following rulings :­ 1}2017(2) T.A.C. 11 (S.C.) Shiva Kumar M. Vs. Managing Director, BMTC ­on the point of income. 14 2}2017(2) T.A.C. 679 (S.C.) Bithika Mazumdar and another Vs. Sagar Pal and others ­on the point of consortium. 3}2015(2) T.A.C. 299 (S.C.) Asha Verman and others Vs. Maharaj Singh and others ­on the point of award of amount towards love and affection to children. 4}2009(2) T.A.C. 677 (S.C.) Smt.Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another ­on the point of deduction. 5}2013 STPL (Comp.) 669 SC Rajesh Vs. Rajbir Singh ­on the point of future prospects. 6}2015(1) T.A.C. 340 (S.C.) Smt.Neeta w/o Kallappa Kadolkar Vs. The Divisional Manager, MSRTC, Kolhapur ­on the point of award of amount towards love and affection to parents, etc. I have gone through the aforesaid rulings carefully as the valuable guideline for me. I have decided this claim by awarding the compensation as calculated. 27]Further, it is made it clear that, there is no exact proof of the income of the deceased therefore, I am not inclined to consider the future prospectus so as to add income of the deceased. Vazirmiyan & ors. Vs. MS Deepti & ors. 15 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 28]In the circumstances all the respondents no.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the said compensation amount as held by me and hence, I answered issue nos.3 and 4 in the affirmative and lastly, I proceed to pass the following order :­ ORDER 1]The claim petition of the claimants is hereby allowed partly with proportionate costs as follows :­ 2]All the Respondent Nos.1 to 3 are held responsible jointly and severally to pay the compensation amount of Rs.14,73,000/­ (Rupees Fourteen Lacs Seventy­Three Thousand only) with 9% interest, from the date of filing of this petition till its realization, including NFL amount of Rs.50,000/­. 3]By excluding NFL amount of Rs.50,000/­, if paid already, the remaining compensation amount shall be apportioned amongst claimant nos.1 to 8 as follows:­ Claimant Nos.1 & 2 ­Rs.1,50,000/­ each Claimant No.3 ­Rs.3,73,000/­ Claimant Nos.4 to 8 ­Rs.1,50,000/­ each. Claimant Nos.4 to 8 being minors, their amounts be invested in fixed deposit scheme of any nationalized bank till they attain age of majority or fixation of their marriage, whichever is earlier. The interest be credited to the account of claimant no.3 quarterly. 16 Rest of the amounts be given to the claimants by account payee cheques. 4]Award be prepared accordingly. Sd/­ [A.R.

Cause of death as per postmortem is – cardio­respiratory arrest is due to multiple fracture and head injury and hemorrhage shock. Due to road traffic accident. Vazirmiyan & ors. Vs. MS Deepti & ors. 9 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 15]Claimants have led their oral and documentary evidence. On the other hand, Respondents No.1 and 2 did not appear and contest the case and case proceeded ex parte against them. As such the adverse inference can be proved against Respondent No.2 – driver of the offending vehicle that, he has driven the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused accident, death of the deceased. 16]No doubt, the insurance policy vide exh.30 on record reveals that, the offending vehicle no. MH­12­HN­0102 was insured with Respondent No.3 for the period from 02.01.2014 to 01.01.2015. The accident had taken place on 18.10.2014. As such this policy covers the risk and liability of the Respondent No.3 – insurance company. 17]However, the respondents did not step into the witnss box. No evidence is led by the respondents side. Considering all these facts and circumstances and considering the oral and documentary evidence as led by the claimants side, I am of the firm view that, the motor vehicle accident has taken place in respect of the offending vehicle wherein the deceased Siraj Deshmukh had expired. As such issue nos.1 and 2 proved at all hence, I answer issue nos.1 and 2 in the affirmative. 10 AS TO ISSUE NOS.3 AND 4 :­ 18]In view of the findings to issues nos.1 and 2 certainly all the claimants are entitled to claim the compensation under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act as against respondents. As such all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, to the claimants. 19]Now the question remains about quantum of the compensation amount to be ascertained, determined. So as to determine the quantum of the compensation, Tribunal has to consider the age, income of the deceased. From the pleadings, oral evidence and documentary evidence as led by the claimants side, the age of the deceased on the date of accident was 40 years and 6 months. There is driving licence of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh vide exh.33 in which the date of birth of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh is mentioned as 10.04.1974. The accident has taken place on 18.10.2014. As such it is established that, the age of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh on the date of accident was 40 years 6 months. Vazirmiyan & ors. Vs. MS Deepti & ors. 11 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 20]In view of the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Smt.Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another reported in 2009(2) T.A.C. 677(S.C.) = 2009(2) T.A.C. 677 the multiplier on considering the age of the deceased must be considered, applied as 15. 21]However, the main question remains about the actual income of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh. As per the case of the claimants and oral evidence of CW1 Vazirmiyan Deshmukh, the net income of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh from the wholesale grocery shop and from the transportation business of two motor vehicles owned by deceased Siraj Deshmukh was Rs.2,00,000/­ per month. But, considering the entire oral and documentary evidence of the claimants side on record, it is nowhere proved and established that, the deceased Siraj Deshmukh's income was Rs.2,00,000/­ per month. 22]In the evidence of CW1 and 2 Vazirmiyan Deshmukh and Lalit Khandelwal, they have deposed that, the deceased was the businessman having its own business of grocery shop. In the evidence of CW2 Lalit Khandelwal as deposed that, the deceased Siraj Deshmukh was his regular customer and he used to purchase 12 the grocery articles from his shop worth Rs.40,000/­ to Rs.45,000/­ at one time. But, on record there is no exact proof about the income of the deceased. As such I have no alternative than to consider the notional income. In the circumstances as per the case of Ramchandrappa Vs. Manager, Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Company Ltd. 2011(4) T.A.C. 1 (S.C.) Rs.4,500/­ can be considered as monthly income of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh on the date of accident. 23]No doubt, in all there are eight dependents i.e. claimants. As such 1/5th deduction can be considered out of the income of the deceased towards personal and living expenses. Therefore, the claimants are entitled for the compensation as under :­ Notional income ­Rs.4,500/­ ­ x 12 months ========= Rs.54,000/­ p.a. Deduction 1/5th ­(minus) Rs.10,800/­ ========= Total Rs.43,200/­ x 15 (multiplier) ========= Rs.6,48,000/­ ========= Therefore, the loss of dependency comes to Rs.6,48,000/­. Vazirmiyan & ors. Vs. MS Deepti & ors. 13 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 24]In view of the ruling of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Smt.Neeta w/o Kallappa Kadolkar and others Vs. The Divisional Manager, MSRTC, Kolhapur 2015(1) T.A.C. 340 (S.C.) ­ the claimants are entitled for Rs.25,000/­ towards funeral expenses, Claimant no.3 – Raziya – widow of the deceased is entitled for Rs.1,00,000/­ towards loss of consortium, I award Rs.1,00,000/­ to the parents of the deceased i.e. claimant nos.1 and 2 towards loss of love and affection. Further, I award Rs.1,00,000/­ towards loss of estate. Further, I award Rs.1,00,000/­ each to the minor children i.e. claimant nos.4 to 8 towards love and affection. 25]Further, in view of the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Smt.Neeta w/o Kallappa Kadolkar and others cited supra 9% interest can be awarded over the compensation amount from the date of filing of claim petition till its realization. 26]Claimants have relied on the following rulings :­ 1}2017(2) T.A.C. 11 (S.C.) Shiva Kumar M. Vs. Managing Director, BMTC ­on the point of income. 14 2}2017(2) T.A.C. 679 (S.C.) Bithika Mazumdar and another Vs.

The Divisional Manager, MSRTC, Kolhapur ­on the point of award of amount towards love and affection to parents, etc. I have gone through the aforesaid rulings carefully as the valuable guideline for me. I have decided this claim by awarding the compensation as calculated. 27]Further, it is made it clear that, there is no exact proof of the income of the deceased therefore, I am not inclined to consider the future prospectus so as to add income of the deceased. Vazirmiyan & ors. Vs. MS Deepti & ors. 15 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 28]In the circumstances all the respondents no.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the said compensation amount as held by me and hence, I answered issue nos.3 and 4 in the affirmative and lastly, I proceed to pass the following order :­ ORDER 1]The claim petition of the claimants is hereby allowed partly with proportionate costs as follows :­ 2]All the Respondent Nos.1 to 3 are held responsible jointly and severally to pay the compensation amount of Rs.14,73,000/­ (Rupees Fourteen Lacs Seventy­Three Thousand only) with 9% interest, from the date of filing of this petition till its realization, including NFL amount of Rs.50,000/­. 3]By excluding NFL amount of Rs.50,000/­, if paid already, the remaining compensation amount shall be apportioned amongst claimant nos.1 to 8 as follows:­ Claimant Nos.1 & 2 ­Rs.1,50,000/­ each Claimant No.3 ­Rs.3,73,000/­ Claimant Nos.4 to 8 ­Rs.1,50,000/­ each.

Pathan & Mr.A.Z. Biyabani – Advs. for claimants Ex parte against Respondent Nos.1 and 2 Mr.S.S. Rathi – Advocate for Respondent No.3 ********************************************** J U D G M E N T [Delivered on 5th day of October, 2017] 1]Claimants have filed this claim petition under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act for claiming compensation of Rs.30,00,000/­ as against the respondents. 2]In brief, facts of claimants case can be summarized as follows :­ Vazirmiyan & ors. Vs. MS Deepti & ors. 3 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 It is the case of the claimants that, deceased Siraj Vazirmiyan Deshmukh was the son of claimant no.1 and claimant no.2. Claimant no.3 Raziya is the widow of deceased Siraj Vazirmiyan Deshmukh. Rest of the claimants no.4 to 8 are the children of the deceased Siraj Vazirmiyan Deshmukh. They all are the dependents of the deceased. 3]On 18.10.2014 deceased Siraj Vazirmiyan Deshmukh was proceeding by driving motorcycle bearing no. MH­20­BD­9268 from Ajanta to Golegaon. At the same time one Tata Safari jeep bearing No. MH­12­HN­0102 came from opposite side in wrong side in high speed and gave dash to the motorcycle of the deceased. As such the accident has taken place. Deceased Siraj Vazirmiyan Deshmukh was admitted to Government Medical College and Hospital at Sillod. The doctor has examined deceased Siraj Vazirmiyan Deshmukh and declared him as dead. His motorcycle was also damaged. 4]The police authority of police station Ajintha had registered a crime bearing Crime No. I­140/2014 under section 279, 337, 338, 304(A) of the IPC and 134/177 of the Motor Vehicles Act as against the driver of Tata Safari jeep – the 4 offending vehicle. Respondent No.2 was the driver of the offending vehicle. Respondent No.1 was the owner of the offending vehicle. The said offending vehicle was insured with Respondent No.3. That policy was valid from 02.01.2014 to 01.01.2015. 5]The postmortem was conducted by the concerned Medical Officer. At the time of accident the deceased was 40 years old. His monthly income was Rs.2,00,000/­ from grocery shop and the other business – transportation as he owned his Tata 407 Matador bearing No. MH­20­B­3212 and loading Ape­Rickshaw bearing No. MH­20­AT­7443. Deceased was the earning hand in his family and he used to maintain all the claimants being Karta of his family. All the claimants have lost their shelter, love and affection, etc. As such all the claimants claimed Rs.30,00,000/­ to the respondents under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act. All the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the said compensation to the claimants. Lastly, they submitted to allow the claim with costs as against respondents. 6]Respondents no.1 and 2 duly served vide public notice in daily newspaper vide exh.17 but they failed to appear hence, case proceeded ex parte against them. Vazirmiyan & ors. Vs. MS Deepti & ors. 5 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 7]Respondent No.3 is the insurer. Insurer appeared and filed its detailed say and written statement vide exh.13. Respondent – insurance company had denied the age, income of the deceased for want of knowledge. Even the insurance company – respondent denied regarding the status of the respondent as a insurer of Tata Safari – offending vehicle No. MH­12­HN­0102. Further, respondent – insurance company denied the rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle at the hands of Respondent No.2. Further, respondent – insurance company denied about the damage of the motorcycle of the deceased. It is contended by the insurance company that, the claim is not at all tenable. 8]According to Respondent – insurance company deceased was driving his motorcycle in rash and negligent manner, caused the accident and he is solely responsible for his death. Respondent – insurance company denied the liability to indemnify the owner of the offending vehicle as the driver of the offending vehicle was not having valid and effective driving licence. There is a fundamental breach of contract of insurance. Hence, claim deserves to be dismissed as against the insurance company. The 6 spot panchanama is suspicious. Lastly, the insurance company has denied the claim and resisted strongly and submitted to dismiss the same. 9]Considering the rival contentions and pleadings of both the parties, my learned predecessor framed issues at exh.18 which are being reproduced as follows, I record my findings with reasons thereon as follows :­ ISSUES FINDINGS 1]Whether petitioners prove that, on 18.10.2014 at about 2.00 pm the accident had taken place on Ajantha – Golegaon road, in front of Khandala phata, within the jurisdiction of Ajantha police station due to rash and negligent driving of the offending driver of Tata Safari Jeep bearing registration No. MH­12­HN­0102 ? In the affirmative. 2]Whether petitioners further prove that, in the above said accident, deceased ­ Siraj Vazirmiyan Deshmukh died in the said accident ?In the affirmative. 3]Whether the petitioners are entitled to get compensation ? If yes, what rate and at what quantum ? Yes, Rs.14,73,000/­. 4]Who is liable to pay compensation ? As per final order . 5]What order ? As per final order. R E A S O N S 10]Heard argument of learned counsel Mr.A.Z. Biyabani for the claimants and learned counsel Mr.S.S. Rathi and Mr.S.S. Vazirmiyan & ors. Vs. MS Deepti & ors. 7 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 Tithe for Respondent No.3 – insurance company at length. No response from Respondents no.1 and 2 i.e. owner of the offending vehicle and driver of the offending vehicle as case proceeded ex parte against them. AS TO ISSUES NO.1 AND 2 :­ 11]In order to substantiate the claim, the claimants have adduced the evidence of claimant no.1 – Vazirmiyan Ganimiyan Deshmukh – father of the deceased vide exh.19, who is testified as he has been cross examined at length. 12]Claimants have relied on documentary evidence. Those are certified copy of FIR at exh.25, spot panchanama exh.26, inquest panchanama exh.27, provisional postmortem notes at exh.28, receipt handing over the dead body at exh.29, insurance policy at exh.30, receipt of insurance premium at exh.31, AA Form exh.32, driving licence of deceased at exh.33. 13]No doubt, the oral evidence of CW1 – father of the deceased is nothing but reproduction of the total contents of the exh.1. Moreover, in support of claim claimants have also adduced the oral evidence of CW2 Lalit s/o Rajendra Khandelwal at exh.35. 8 Second witness is the witness to prove that, the deceased was his customer and wholesale dealer regarding grocery shop. In his evidence CW2 stated that, the bills issued by his shop New Tirupati Traders in the name of deceased Siraj Deshmukh. Those are marked at Exh.36 collectively. He was also testified. But, from the oral evidence of CW1 and 2 the quantum of the exact income of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh is not proved at all. 14]Now no doubt, from the police case papers as aforesaid including the FIR, spot panchanama, inquest panchanama, postmortem report, Form AA, it is crystal clear and goes to prove that the deceased Siraj Deshmukh had died in motor vehicle accident. Moreover, from the police case papers it reveals and goes to prove that, Respondent No.1 was the owner of the offending vehicle – Tata Safari beraing No. MH­12­HN­0102 and Respondent No.2 Samratsingh Khutal was the driver of the offending vehicle. From all the police case papers i.e. postmortem report, inquest panchanama, etc. it is proved that the deceased had expired in an accident. Cause of death as per postmortem is – cardio­respiratory arrest is due to multiple fracture and head injury and hemorrhage shock. Due to road traffic accident. Vazirmiyan & ors. Vs. MS Deepti & ors. 9 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 15]Claimants have led their oral and documentary evidence. On the other hand, Respondents No.1 and 2 did not appear and contest the case and case proceeded ex parte against them. As such the adverse inference can be proved against Respondent No.2 – driver of the offending vehicle that, he has driven the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused accident, death of the deceased. 16]No doubt, the insurance policy vide exh.30 on record reveals that, the offending vehicle no. MH­12­HN­0102 was insured with Respondent No.3 for the period from 02.01.2014 to 01.01.2015. The accident had taken place on 18.10.2014. As such this policy covers the risk and liability of the Respondent No.3 – insurance company. 17]However, the respondents did not step into the witnss box. No evidence is led by the respondents side. Considering all these facts and circumstances and considering the oral and documentary evidence as led by the claimants side, I am of the firm view that, the motor vehicle accident has taken place in respect of the offending vehicle wherein the deceased Siraj Deshmukh had expired. As such issue nos.1 and 2 proved at all hence, I answer issue nos.1 and 2 in the affirmative. 10 AS TO ISSUE NOS.3 AND 4 :­ 18]In view of the findings to issues nos.1 and 2 certainly all the claimants are entitled to claim the compensation under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act as against respondents. As such all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, to the claimants. 19]Now the question remains about quantum of the compensation amount to be ascertained, determined. So as to determine the quantum of the compensation, Tribunal has to consider the age, income of the deceased. From the pleadings, oral evidence and documentary evidence as led by the claimants side, the age of the deceased on the date of accident was 40 years and 6 months. There is driving licence of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh vide exh.33 in which the date of birth of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh is mentioned as 10.04.1974. The accident has taken place on 18.10.2014. As such it is established that, the age of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh on the date of accident was 40 years 6 months. Vazirmiyan & ors. Vs. MS Deepti & ors. 11 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 20]In view of the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Smt.Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another reported in 2009(2) T.A.C. 677(S.C.) = 2009(2) T.A.C. 677 the multiplier on considering the age of the deceased must be considered, applied as 15. 21]However, the main question remains about the actual income of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh. As per the case of the claimants and oral evidence of CW1 Vazirmiyan Deshmukh, the net income of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh from the wholesale grocery shop and from the transportation business of two motor vehicles owned by deceased Siraj Deshmukh was Rs.2,00,000/­ per month. But, considering the entire oral and documentary evidence of the claimants side on record, it is nowhere proved and established that, the deceased Siraj Deshmukh's income was Rs.2,00,000/­ per month. 22]In the evidence of CW1 and 2 Vazirmiyan Deshmukh and Lalit Khandelwal, they have deposed that, the deceased was the businessman having its own business of grocery shop.

But, on record there is no exact proof about the income of the deceased. As such I have no alternative than to consider the notional income. In the circumstances as per the case of Ramchandrappa Vs. Manager, Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Company Ltd. 2011(4) T.A.C. 1 (S.C.) Rs.4,500/­ can be considered as monthly income of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh on the date of accident. 23]No doubt, in all there are eight dependents i.e. claimants. As such 1/5th deduction can be considered out of the income of the deceased towards personal and living expenses. Therefore, the claimants are entitled for the compensation as under :­ Notional income ­Rs.4,500/­ ­ x 12 months ========= Rs.54,000/­ p.a.

MS Deepti & ors. 13 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 24]In view of the ruling of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Smt.Neeta w/o Kallappa Kadolkar and others Vs.

Pathan & Mr.A.Z. Biyabani – Advs. for claimants Ex parte against Respondent Nos.1 and 2 Mr.S.S. Rathi – Advocate for Respondent No.3 ********************************************** J U D G M E N T [Delivered on 5th day of October, 2017] 1]Claimants have filed this claim petition under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act for claiming compensation of Rs.30,00,000/­ as against the respondents. 2]In brief, facts of claimants case can be summarized as follows :­ Vazirmiyan & ors. Vs. MS Deepti & ors. 3 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 It is the case of the claimants that, deceased Siraj Vazirmiyan Deshmukh was the son of claimant no.1 and claimant no.2. Claimant no.3 Raziya is the widow of deceased Siraj Vazirmiyan Deshmukh. Rest of the claimants no.4 to 8 are the children of the deceased Siraj Vazirmiyan Deshmukh. They all are the dependents of the deceased. 3]On 18.10.2014 deceased Siraj Vazirmiyan Deshmukh was proceeding by driving motorcycle bearing no. MH­20­BD­9268 from Ajanta to Golegaon. At the same time one Tata Safari jeep bearing No. MH­12­HN­0102 came from opposite side in wrong side in high speed and gave dash to the motorcycle of the deceased. As such the accident has taken place. Deceased Siraj Vazirmiyan Deshmukh was admitted to Government Medical College and Hospital at Sillod. The doctor has examined deceased Siraj Vazirmiyan Deshmukh and declared him as dead. His motorcycle was also damaged. 4]The police authority of police station Ajintha had registered a crime bearing Crime No. I­140/2014 under section 279, 337, 338, 304(A) of the IPC and 134/177 of the Motor Vehicles Act as against the driver of Tata Safari jeep – the 4 offending vehicle. Respondent No.2 was the driver of the offending vehicle. Respondent No.1 was the owner of the offending vehicle. The said offending vehicle was insured with Respondent No.3. That policy was valid from 02.01.2014 to 01.01.2015. 5]The postmortem was conducted by the concerned Medical Officer. At the time of accident the deceased was 40 years old. His monthly income was Rs.2,00,000/­ from grocery shop and the other business – transportation as he owned his Tata 407 Matador bearing No. MH­20­B­3212 and loading Ape­Rickshaw bearing No. MH­20­AT­7443. Deceased was the earning hand in his family and he used to maintain all the claimants being Karta of his family. All the claimants have lost their shelter, love and affection, etc. As such all the claimants claimed Rs.30,00,000/­ to the respondents under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act. All the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the said compensation to the claimants. Lastly, they submitted to allow the claim with costs as against respondents. 6]Respondents no.1 and 2 duly served vide public notice in daily newspaper vide exh.17 but they failed to appear hence, case proceeded ex parte against them. Vazirmiyan & ors. Vs. MS Deepti & ors. 5 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 7]Respondent No.3 is the insurer. Insurer appeared and filed its detailed say and written statement vide exh.13. Respondent – insurance company had denied the age, income of the deceased for want of knowledge. Even the insurance company – respondent denied regarding the status of the respondent as a insurer of Tata Safari – offending vehicle No. MH­12­HN­0102. Further, respondent – insurance company denied the rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle at the hands of Respondent No.2. Further, respondent – insurance company denied about the damage of the motorcycle of the deceased. It is contended by the insurance company that, the claim is not at all tenable. 8]According to Respondent – insurance company deceased was driving his motorcycle in rash and negligent manner, caused the accident and he is solely responsible for his death. Respondent – insurance company denied the liability to indemnify the owner of the offending vehicle as the driver of the offending vehicle was not having valid and effective driving licence. There is a fundamental breach of contract of insurance. Hence, claim deserves to be dismissed as against the insurance company. The 6 spot panchanama is suspicious. Lastly, the insurance company has denied the claim and resisted strongly and submitted to dismiss the same. 9]Considering the rival contentions and pleadings of both the parties, my learned predecessor framed issues at exh.18 which are being reproduced as follows, I record my findings with reasons thereon as follows :­ ISSUES FINDINGS 1]Whether petitioners prove that, on 18.10.2014 at about 2.00 pm the accident had taken place on Ajantha – Golegaon road, in front of Khandala phata, within the jurisdiction of Ajantha police station due to rash and negligent driving of the offending driver of Tata Safari Jeep bearing registration No. MH­12­HN­0102 ? In the affirmative. 2]Whether petitioners further prove that, in the above said accident, deceased ­ Siraj Vazirmiyan Deshmukh died in the said accident ?In the affirmative. 3]Whether the petitioners are entitled to get compensation ? If yes, what rate and at what quantum ? Yes, Rs.14,73,000/­. 4]Who is liable to pay compensation ? As per final order . 5]What order ? As per final order. R E A S O N S 10]Heard argument of learned counsel Mr.A.Z. Biyabani for the claimants and learned counsel Mr.S.S. Rathi and Mr.S.S. Vazirmiyan & ors. Vs. MS Deepti & ors. 7 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 Tithe for Respondent No.3 – insurance company at length. No response from Respondents no.1 and 2 i.e. owner of the offending vehicle and driver of the offending vehicle as case proceeded ex parte against them. AS TO ISSUES NO.1 AND 2 :­ 11]In order to substantiate the claim, the claimants have adduced the evidence of claimant no.1 – Vazirmiyan Ganimiyan Deshmukh – father of the deceased vide exh.19, who is testified as he has been cross examined at length. 12]Claimants have relied on documentary evidence. Those are certified copy of FIR at exh.25, spot panchanama exh.26, inquest panchanama exh.27, provisional postmortem notes at exh.28, receipt handing over the dead body at exh.29, insurance policy at exh.30, receipt of insurance premium at exh.31, AA Form exh.32, driving licence of deceased at exh.33. 13]No doubt, the oral evidence of CW1 – father of the deceased is nothing but reproduction of the total contents of the exh.1. Moreover, in support of claim claimants have also adduced the oral evidence of CW2 Lalit s/o Rajendra Khandelwal at exh.35. 8 Second witness is the witness to prove that, the deceased was his customer and wholesale dealer regarding grocery shop. In his evidence CW2 stated that, the bills issued by his shop New Tirupati Traders in the name of deceased Siraj Deshmukh. Those are marked at Exh.36 collectively. He was also testified. But, from the oral evidence of CW1 and 2 the quantum of the exact income of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh is not proved at all. 14]Now no doubt, from the police case papers as aforesaid including the FIR, spot panchanama, inquest panchanama, postmortem report, Form AA, it is crystal clear and goes to prove that the deceased Siraj Deshmukh had died in motor vehicle accident. Moreover, from the police case papers it reveals and goes to prove that, Respondent No.1 was the owner of the offending vehicle – Tata Safari beraing No. MH­12­HN­0102 and Respondent No.2 Samratsingh Khutal was the driver of the offending vehicle. From all the police case papers i.e. postmortem report, inquest panchanama, etc. it is proved that the deceased had expired in an accident. Cause of death as per postmortem is – cardio­respiratory arrest is due to multiple fracture and head injury and hemorrhage shock. Due to road traffic accident. Vazirmiyan & ors. Vs. MS Deepti & ors. 9 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 15]Claimants have led their oral and documentary evidence. On the other hand, Respondents No.1 and 2 did not appear and contest the case and case proceeded ex parte against them. As such the adverse inference can be proved against Respondent No.2 – driver of the offending vehicle that, he has driven the offending vehicle in a rash and negligent manner and caused accident, death of the deceased. 16]No doubt, the insurance policy vide exh.30 on record reveals that, the offending vehicle no. MH­12­HN­0102 was insured with Respondent No.3 for the period from 02.01.2014 to 01.01.2015. The accident had taken place on 18.10.2014. As such this policy covers the risk and liability of the Respondent No.3 – insurance company. 17]However, the respondents did not step into the witnss box. No evidence is led by the respondents side. Considering all these facts and circumstances and considering the oral and documentary evidence as led by the claimants side, I am of the firm view that, the motor vehicle accident has taken place in respect of the offending vehicle wherein the deceased Siraj Deshmukh had expired. As such issue nos.1 and 2 proved at all hence, I answer issue nos.1 and 2 in the affirmative. 10 AS TO ISSUE NOS.3 AND 4 :­ 18]In view of the findings to issues nos.1 and 2 certainly all the claimants are entitled to claim the compensation under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act as against respondents. As such all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, to the claimants. 19]Now the question remains about quantum of the compensation amount to be ascertained, determined. So as to determine the quantum of the compensation, Tribunal has to consider the age, income of the deceased. From the pleadings, oral evidence and documentary evidence as led by the claimants side, the age of the deceased on the date of accident was 40 years and 6 months. There is driving licence of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh vide exh.33 in which the date of birth of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh is mentioned as 10.04.1974. The accident has taken place on 18.10.2014. As such it is established that, the age of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh on the date of accident was 40 years 6 months. Vazirmiyan & ors. Vs. MS Deepti & ors. 11 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 20]In view of the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Smt.Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another reported in 2009(2) T.A.C. 677(S.C.) = 2009(2) T.A.C. 677 the multiplier on considering the age of the deceased must be considered, applied as 15. 21]However, the main question remains about the actual income of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh. As per the case of the claimants and oral evidence of CW1 Vazirmiyan Deshmukh, the net income of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh from the wholesale grocery shop and from the transportation business of two motor vehicles owned by deceased Siraj Deshmukh was Rs.2,00,000/­ per month. But, considering the entire oral and documentary evidence of the claimants side on record, it is nowhere proved and established that, the deceased Siraj Deshmukh's income was Rs.2,00,000/­ per month. 22]In the evidence of CW1 and 2 Vazirmiyan Deshmukh and Lalit Khandelwal, they have deposed that, the deceased was the businessman having its own business of grocery shop. In the evidence of CW2 Lalit Khandelwal as deposed that, the deceased Siraj Deshmukh was his regular customer and he used to purchase 12 the grocery articles from his shop worth Rs.40,000/­ to Rs.45,000/­ at one time. But, on record there is no exact proof about the income of the deceased. As such I have no alternative than to consider the notional income. In the circumstances as per the case of Ramchandrappa Vs. Manager, Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Company Ltd. 2011(4) T.A.C. 1 (S.C.) Rs.4,500/­ can be considered as monthly income of the deceased Siraj Deshmukh on the date of accident. 23]No doubt, in all there are eight dependents i.e. claimants. As such 1/5th deduction can be considered out of the income of the deceased towards personal and living expenses. Therefore, the claimants are entitled for the compensation as under :­ Notional income ­Rs.4,500/­ ­ x 12 months ========= Rs.54,000/­ p.a. Deduction 1/5th ­(minus) Rs.10,800/­ ========= Total Rs.43,200/­ x 15 (multiplier) ========= Rs.6,48,000/­ ========= Therefore, the loss of dependency comes to Rs.6,48,000/­. Vazirmiyan & ors. Vs. MS Deepti & ors. 13 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 24]In view of the ruling of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Smt.Neeta w/o Kallappa Kadolkar and others Vs. The Divisional Manager, MSRTC, Kolhapur 2015(1) T.A.C. 340 (S.C.) ­ the claimants are entitled for Rs.25,000/­ towards funeral expenses, Claimant no.3 – Raziya – widow of the deceased is entitled for Rs.1,00,000/­ towards loss of consortium, I award Rs.1,00,000/­ to the parents of the deceased i.e. claimant nos.1 and 2 towards loss of love and affection. Further, I award Rs.1,00,000/­ towards loss of estate. Further, I award Rs.1,00,000/­ each to the minor children i.e. claimant nos.4 to 8 towards love and affection. 25]Further, in view of the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Smt.Neeta w/o Kallappa Kadolkar and others cited supra 9% interest can be awarded over the compensation amount from the date of filing of claim petition till its realization. 26]Claimants have relied on the following rulings :­ 1}2017(2) T.A.C. 11 (S.C.) Shiva Kumar M. Vs. Managing Director, BMTC ­on the point of income. 14 2}2017(2) T.A.C. 679 (S.C.) Bithika Mazumdar and another Vs. Sagar Pal and others ­on the point of consortium. 3}2015(2) T.A.C. 299 (S.C.) Asha Verman and others Vs. Maharaj Singh and others ­on the point of award of amount towards love and affection to children. 4}2009(2) T.A.C. 677 (S.C.) Smt.Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another ­on the point of deduction. 5}2013 STPL (Comp.) 669 SC Rajesh Vs. Rajbir Singh ­on the point of future prospects. 6}2015(1) T.A.C. 340 (S.C.) Smt.Neeta w/o Kallappa Kadolkar Vs. The Divisional Manager, MSRTC, Kolhapur ­on the point of award of amount towards love and affection to parents, etc. I have gone through the aforesaid rulings carefully as the valuable guideline for me. I have decided this claim by awarding the compensation as calculated. 27]Further, it is made it clear that, there is no exact proof of the income of the deceased therefore, I am not inclined to consider the future prospectus so as to add income of the deceased. Vazirmiyan & ors. Vs. MS Deepti & ors. 15 Judgment – MACP No.18/2015 28]In the circumstances all the respondents no.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the said compensation amount as held by me and hence, I answered issue nos.3 and 4 in the affirmative and lastly, I proceed to pass the following order :­ ORDER 1]The claim petition of the claimants is hereby allowed partly with proportionate costs as follows :­ 2]All the Respondent Nos.1 to 3 are held responsible jointly and severally to pay the compensation amount of Rs.14,73,000/­ (Rupees Fourteen Lacs Seventy­Three Thousand only) with 9% interest, from the date of filing of this petition till its realization, including NFL amount of Rs.50,000/­. 3]By excluding NFL amount of Rs.50,000/­, if paid already, the remaining compensation amount shall be apportioned amongst claimant nos.1 to 8 as follows:­ Claimant Nos.1 & 2 ­Rs.1,50,000/­ each Claimant No.3 ­Rs.3,73,000/­ Claimant Nos.4 to 8 ­Rs.1,50,000/­ each.

Respondent No.2 ­ Ex­parte Advocate S.A.Ambad for the respondent No.3 . **************************************************** J U D G M E N T [Delivered on this 27th day of February, 2018] 1.The claimant has filed the claim petition u/s 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act for claiming compensation amounting to Rs.3,00,000/­ against the respondents. 2.In nut­shell, the facts of the claimant case can be summarized as follows :­ It is case of claimant that on 03.08.2015 at about 07.00 hours the vehicular accident took place at Jalna to Aurangabad road. At that time, claimant Munawwar Khan was traveling by bi­cycle. At the relevant time, respondent No.3 Vasant drove motor­vehicle (Maroti­800) No. MH­17­N­311 (hereinafter referred to as offending vehicle) in rash and negligent manner and gave dash to the claimant. In the said accident claimant sustained injuries to his body. He was admitted and treated as in­door patient at Saoji Hospital, Aurangabad from 03.08.2015 to 06.08.2015. He was operated there and incurred an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ for medical treatment. 3.The Karmad Police Station has registered crime bearing Munawwar Vs. New India & Otrs. Judgment – MACP No749/2015 (( 3 )) No.152/2015 against the driver of offending vehicle i.e. respondent No.3 for the offences punishable u/s 279, 337 and 338 of the Indian Penal Code. 4.On the date of accident the victim was 55 years old and due to the accidental injuries the he sustained permanent disability. As such, he is unable to do his daily routine work and facing trouble in day to day life. On the date of accident the claimant was doing business of selling vegetable and earning Rs.15,000/­ per month. 5.The respondent No.1 is the Insurance Company with whom the offending vehicle was insured at the time of accident while respondent No.2 is owner and respondent No.3 is driver of the offending. Therefore, all the respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation with 18% interest from the date of filing of petition. Lastly claimant prayed to allow his claim as against the respondents. 6.In response to the claim petition, respondent No.1 appeared and filed its detailed say/written statement at Exh.­11. The respondent No.1 Insurance Company has resisted the claim of claimant and denied age, income of the deceased and allegations of rash and negligent driving at the hands of driver of offending vehicle. It is defence of the Insurance Company that the driver of the offending vehicle was not holding valid and effective driving licence on the date of accident. Furthermore, there 4 was no valid and effective fitness certificate in respect of the offending vehicle. As such, there was breach of terms and conditions of the policy. The respondent No.1 Insurance Company has denied the entire claim of the claimant and lastly submit to dismiss the claim with costs. 7.In spite of due service of summons, the respondent No.2 failed to appear. Hence claim proceeded ex­parte against him. 8.The respondent No.3 Vasant appeared and filed his written statement vide Exh.­17. He denied age and income of the victim, as well as, denied allegations of rash and negligent driving on the date of accident. According to the respondent No.3 he was driving the offending vehicle i.e. car in moterate speed. At that time, claimant himself was rash and negligent on the road without following traffic rules. This respondent also denied period of admission of claimant to the hospital and also denied the medical expenses allegedly incurred by the claimant. This respondent denied permanent disability of the claimant. According to him the offending vehicle is duly insured with respondent No.1 Insurance Company and owned by respondent No.2 Sanjay Khandagade. He further stated that he was holding valid and effective driving licence on the date of accident. he was not at fault on the date of accident. Lastly he prayed to dismiss the claim as against him with costs. 9.Considering pleadings of the claimant and respondent I Munawwar Vs. New India & Otrs. Judgment – MACP No749/2015 (( 5 )) have framed issues vide Exh.­21 which are being reproduced as follows and I record my findings with reasons thereon as follows :­ ISSUES FINDINGS 1]Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of motor­ vehicle No. MH­17­N­311 driven by the respondent No.3? In the affirmative 2]Whether the claimant sustained permanent disability due to the injuries suffered by him in the said accident? If yes, to what extent ?In the affirmative To the extent of 25% 3]Whether the claimant is entitled to get compensation amount ? If yes, to what extent ?As per final order 4]Who is liable to pay compensation? All the respondent No.1 to 3 5]What order and award? As per final order. R E A S O N S 10.Heard arguments of learned counsel Shri.Mohasin Qazi for the claimant and learned counsel Shri.S.s.Thite for the respondent No.1 Insurance Company, as well as, learned counsel Shri.S.A.Ambad for the respondent No.3 at length. The claim proceeded ex­parte against the respondent No.2. Perused record and proceedings carefully. 11.In order to prove his case, the claimant led his oral evidence at Exh.­25, as well as, examined P.W.­2 Dr. Parmeshwar 6 Shivlal Jaiswal vide Exh.­33 just to prove permanent disability certificate issued by him at Exh.­34 and closed evidence vide pursis Exh.­40. There is no oral evidence led by the respondent side. 12.It is not in dispute that the accident took place. Further it is not disputed that offending vehicle is owned by respondent No.2, driven by respondent No.3 and the same is insured with respondent No.1 on the date of accident. 13.Prior to appreciation of oral and documentary evidence adduced by the parties I must refer the following rulings :­ (1)The Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of United India Insurance Company Ltd Vs. Sayaji, reported in LAWS (BOM) 2008­8­223 has observed that :­ “Since the motor accident tribunal is the tribunal, strict rule of the Evidence Act not applicable and tribunal can very well consider what was the case made out before the police after the incident. This Court can take into consideration the certified copies of various documents on record. The certified copy of F.I.R., spot panchanama and inquest panchanama can be read in evidence without any additional proof”. (2)Further the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of N.K.V.Brothers Pvt. Ltd. Vs. M. Karunamai Ammal, reported in 1980 ACJ 345 (S.C.) has held that :­ Munawwar Vs. New India & Otrs. Judgment – MACP No749/2015 (( 7 )) “The accident claim tribunal must take special care to see that innocent victim do not suffer and drivers and owners do not escape from liability merely because of some doubts here or some obscurity there. The Court should not succumb to niceties, technicalities and mystic maybes.” AS TO ISSUE NO.1 :­ 14.Upon perusal of oral and documentary evidence as led by the claimant i.e FIR Exh.­26, spot panchanama Exh.­27, Form­AA Exh.­ 31, it is well established that respondent No.3 Vasant Murlidhar Shinde was driving the offending vehicle on the date of accident. In cross­ examination of P.W.­1, the suggestion was given to this witness that he himself was at fault on the date of accident, but this witness denied the same. As such, it is crystal clear that fact of occurrence of accident is not in dispute. 15.The FIR lodged by the claimant himself vide Exh.­26 against the driver of the offending vehicle. The spot panchanama Exh.­ 27 also reveals that the offending vehicle was involved in the accident and there are allegations against the respondent No.3 i.e. driver of the offending vehicle about rash and negligent driving. 16.No doubt, the respondent No.3 did not step into witness box to deny rash and negligent driving. He only denied the same in his 8 written statement vide Exh.­17. In the circumstances, from the oral, as well as, documentary evidence led by the claimant it is proved that accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle which is driven by the respondent No.3. Hence, issue No.1 proved at all. Accordingly I answer the same in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO.2 :­ 17.In order to prove the permanent disability, the claimant led his own evidence and the evidence of P.W.­2 Dr. Parmeshwar Jaiswal at Exh.­33. Upon carefully perusal of evidence of P.W.­2 Dr. Parmeshwar Jaiswal, he deposed that claimant has sustained fracture lumbar vertebra second and forth with contusion shoulder left and neck. He was treated conservatively with spinal brace. Now he has pain at lumbar region. He has layphosis at lumbar three­four region. Tenderness at number spine. He has pain radiating to right lower leg SLR 45 degree on right side. Sensation impaired on right leg below knee. He has pain around left shoulder. Movement of the shoulder restricted. According to the Dr. Jaiswal claimant has permanent disability 25 % for spine and 10% for shoulder. Total 35% by Mc­Bride scale. 18.Moreover, in his cross­examination he admitted that there is no fracture to the shoulder of claimant. In chief examination he admitted that claimant has pain around shoulder. The said doctor issued permanent disability certificate mentioning therein permanent disability Munawwar Vs. New India & Otrs. Judgment – MACP No749/2015 (( 9 )) of 25% for spine and 10% for shoulder. However, I consider only 25% permanent disability for spine only, because in the evidence of Dr. Jaiswal, he deposed that claimant has pain around left shoulder and in cross­examination admitted that there is no fracture to the shoulder of claimant. Considering this I hold that claimant has permanent disability to the extent of 25% only and answer issue No.2 accordingly. AS TO ISSUE NO.3 :­ 19.It is proved that due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle at the hands of respondent No.3 the accident occurred and in that accident claimant sustained injuries and suffered 25% permanent disability as per findings in earlier para vide permanent disability certificate Exh.­34. In the circumstances the claimant is entitled for compensation amount u/s 166 of the Motor Vehicle Act. 20.Now so as to determine the compensation amount the tribunal has to consider the age and income of the claimant. The claimant come­up with the case that on the date of accident he was 55 years old, but in this regard he has not produced any documentary evidence about his age. On the other hand respondent No.1 Insurance Company has filed on record the copy of identity card of the claimant as issued by the Election Commission below Exh.­39 in which age of the claimant as on 01.01.2006 was shown as 51 years. However, the accident took place on 03.08.2015. As such, age of the claimant is 10 proved as 60 years on the date of accident. Hence as per the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sarla Varma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another, 2009(2) T.A.C. 677 (S.C.) the multiplier of 9 can be applied to this case. 21. The claimant come­up with the case that he was earning Rs.15,000/­ per month from the business of selling vegetable on the date of accident. No doubt there is no proof on record to prove the income of the claimant. Therefore, I have no alternative than to consider the notional income of claimant of Rs.4,500/­ per month as per the ruling of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ramchandrappa Vs. Manager, Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Company Ltd., reported in 2011(4) T.A.C. (1) (S.C.) . In the circumstances calculation for computation of compensation to the claimant would be as follows :­ Rs.4,500/­ X 12 X 9 = Rs.4,86,000/­. 22.Considering the 25% permanent disability the claimant is entitled for 25% amount of Rs.4,86,000/­ which comes to Rs.1,21,500/­. 23.As per discharge­card of Saoji Hospital Exh.­32 it reveals that the claimant was admitted only for three days. As such, considering the injuries sustained by the claimant, as well as, permanent disability of 25% Rs.5,000/­ would be the reasonable amount towards pain and suffering. Hence claimant is entitled for total compensation of Rs.1,26,500/­ with 9% interest on the said compensation amount from Munawwar Vs. New India & Otrs. Judgment – MACP No749/2015 (( 11 )) the date of filing petition i.e. 21.11.2015 till its full realization, as per the observations of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Smt. Neeta w/o Kallappa Kadolkar and others Vs. The Divisional Manager, MSRTC, Kolhapur reported in 2015(1) T.A.C.340 (S.C.). As such issue No.3 proved, hence I answer the same affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO.4 :­ 24.No doubt, the respondent No.2 is owner of the offending vehicle and it was insured with respondent No.1 Insurance Company on the date of accident vide policy Exh.­28. The policy was valid for the period from 22.05.2015 to 21.05.2016 and accident took place in August­2015. As such, on the date of accident the risk of offending vehicle was covered in view of the contract of insurance between respondent No.1 and 2. As such, I hold that respondent No.1 to 3 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation amount of Rs.1,26,500/­ to the claimant. Hence I answer issue No.4 accordingly as it is proved. AS TO ISSUE NO.5 :­ 25.In view of findings given to the aforesaid issues the claim of the claimant deserved to be allowed with proportionate costs and all the respondent are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the claimant with 9% interest. Hence I answer the issue No.5 12 accordingly and proceed to pass the following roder. ORDER 1]The claim of the claimant is hereby allowed partly with proportionate costs as follows :­ 2]Respondent Nos.1 to 3 are hereby liable to pay the compensation amount of Rs.1,26,500/­ (Rupees One Lacs Twenty Six Thousand Five Hundred Only) with 9% interest to the claimant from the date of filing of this petition i.e. 21.11.2015 till its realization, including NFL amount. 3]Award be prepared accordingly. 4]Order pronounced in open Court.

J U D G M E N T [ Delivered on 23rd March, 2017 ] The present petition is filed for grant of compensation under Section 166 of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, on account of unfortunate death of Ashok Sarjerao Jadhav, R/o : Pal, Tq. Phulambri, District Aurangabad in motor vehicle accident. The claimants are legal representatives of deceased Ashok Sarjerao Jadhav who lost his life on 18.10.2015 because of injuries sustained to him in motor vehicle accident. Claimant No.1 the widow, claimant No.2 & 3 are children and claimant No.4 is mother of deceased Ashok Sarjerao Jadhav. 2.Brief facts of the claim­ It is the case of claimants that on 18.10.2015 at about 13.00 hours deceased Ashok Sarjerao Jadhav was travelling in Tata Tempo 407 bearing registration No.MH­20­CT­4552 on Wazad Phata, A.B.Road Near Jalwajiya, Rajpur, District Badwani (Madhya Pradesh). At that time, Tata Tempo 407 was driven by respondent No.1 in rash and negligent manner and he tried to overtake truck in which he gave dash to the said truck because of which the accident happened and the deceased sustained serious injuries. The deceased was [ 3] M.A.C.P.No.774/2015, [ Judgment ]. immediately shifted to Civil Hospital, Jalwajiya and during the course of medical treatment, he died on 18.10.2015. 3.On the basis of report lodged by Shaikh Rabbani Shaikh Nashir, Police Station, Rajapur, District Badwani (M.P.) registered offence vide Crime No.I­070/2015 under Section 279, 337, 304­A of I.P.C. against the driver of Tata Tempo 407 bearing registration No.MH­20­CT­4552 i.e. respondent No.1. 4.The claimants further contended that at the time of death, the deceased was 45 years old and he was working as labour and cleaner and was earning monthly income of Rs.7,000/­ and was maintaining all the claimants. The claimants were fully dependent upon the income of deceased but due to unfortunate death of deceased, the claimants lost their earning hands. The claimants further contended that respondent No.1 was driver/owner of Tata Tempo 407 bearing registration No.MH­20­CT­4552 and the same was insured with respondent No.2. Therefore, respondent No.1 & 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to claimants. The claimants have claimed compensation to the tune of Rs.8,00,000/­ including the compensation under other conventional heads. 5.Respondent No.1 failed to file his written statement. Hence, claim proceeded without written statement against him. 6.Respondent No.2 filed their written statement at Exh­21. They [ 4] M.A.C.P.No.774/2015, [ Judgment ]. denied that the driver of Tata Tempo 407 bearing registration No.MH­20­CT­ 4552 was driving the said tempo in high speed, rash and negligent manner and in an attempt to overtake the truck, gave dash to the truck. They further denied the age and income of the deceased and submitted that the claim petition be rejected. 7.On the basis of rival pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed by me below Exh­23 and I record my findings against each of them for the reasons stated below. I S S U E S F I N D I N G S 1.Whether the claimants prove that deceased Ashok Sarjerao Jadhav died in motor accident held on 18.10.2015 ? .. Yes. 2.Whether claimants prove that the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of vehicle Tata Tempo bearing registration No. MH­20­CT­4552 driven by repondent No.1 ? .. Yes. 3.Whether respondents prove that the deceased was not travelling in Tata Tempo bearing registration No.MH­20­ CT­4552 at the time of accident ? .. No. 4.Whether claimants are entitle for compensation ? If yes, to what quantum, and from whom ? .. Rs.10,42,000/­ @ 7% P.A. from respondent No.1 & 2 jointly and severally. 5.What order and award ? .. As per final order. [ 5] M.A.C.P.No.774/2015, [ Judgment ]. R E A S O N S 8.In order to substantiate the contentions raised in the petition, claimant No.1 Kadubai Ashok Jadhav deposed before this court as CW1 and filed relevant police papers pertaining to the accident in question. They are F.I.R. at Exh­26, Spot Panchanama at Exh­27, M.L.C. at Exh­28, Postmortem Report at Exh­29 and filed evidence close Pursis at Exh­30. 9.Respondent No.1 did not lead any evidence. Hence, his evidence was closed vide order dated 18.03.2017. 10.Respondent No.2 filed their evidence close Pursis at Exh­34. As to Issue No.1 to 3 : 11.The Learned advocate appearing for claimants submitted that the police papers pertaining to the accident in question clearly indicates that respondent No.1 was driving Tata Tempo 407 bearing registration No.MH­20­CT­ 4552 in rash and negligent manner and gave dash to the truck, while overtaking the said truck. He further submitted that respondent No.1 was owner and driver of said Tata Tempo, at the relevant time and it was insured with respondent No.2. Therefore, they are liable to pay compensation to the claimants. 12.CW1 has deposed that on 18.10.2015 at about 13.00 hours her husband deceased Ashok Sarjerao Jadhav was travelling by Tata Tempo 407 bearing registration No.MH­20­CT­4552 on A.B.Road, near Jalwajiya, Rajpur, [ 6] M.A.C.P.No.774/2015, [ Judgment ]. District Badwani (M.P.). At that time, respondent No.1 the driver of the said Tata Tempo was driving the Tempo in high speed and negligent manner and in an attempt to overtake truck, gave dash to the truck because of which the deceased sustained injuries. He was shifted to Government Hospital, Jalwajiya and during the course of treatment, he died. 13.F.I.R. filed at Exh­26, Spot Panchanama at Exh­27, M.L.C. Exh­28 show that the accident has occurred between Tempo and Truck. The Postmortem Report filed by claimant at Exh­29 shows the cause of death as “death shock due to injury heart & lungs and hemorrhage time interval ”. Respondent No.1 was driving the said vehicle at the relevant time, has not stepped into witness­box so as to rebut the testimony of claimant No.1 and the police papers filed by her. The police papers such as FIR, Spot Panchanama and M.L.C. shows that the accident has happened because of negligency of respondent No.1. Hence, I answer Issue No1 & 2 as 'Yes' and Issue No.3 as 'No'. As to Issue No.4 : 14.CW1 deposed in her deposition that her husband was doing work of labour and cleaner and was earning Rs.7,000/­ per month. The claimant has not filed any documentary evidence to show that the deceased was doing work of labour and cleaner, neither she has examine any witness to prove the said fact. Therefore, in absence of any evidence about the income of deceased, the notional [ 7] M.A.C.P.No.774/2015, [ Judgment ]. income of Rs.4,500/­ is taken as the income of deceased, at the time of his death. Therefore, the annual income of deceased will Rs.54,000/­. 15.It appears from the record that there were four dependents on the deceased, at the time of his death. Therefore, ¼ of his annual income is deducted as his personal expenses. After deducting the ¼ the annual earning of deceased comes to Rs.40,500/­. 16.CW1 has deposed in her affidavit of evidence that the deceased was 45 years old, at the time of his death. The said testimony of CW1 find support from the Postmortem Report filed by her on record. In Postmortem Report the age of deceased is mentioned as 45 years. Hence, the multiplier of 14 is applied in the present case, as per the guidelines issued by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sarla Verma vs Delhi Transport Corporation and Anr. , reported in AIR 2009 S.C. 3104. Therefore, the loss of dependency comes to Rs.5,67,000/­. 17.The claimant No.1 has lost her husband, therefore, she is entitle to an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ towards consortium. The claimant No.1 is also entitle for an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ towards loss of estate as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kalpanaraj & Ors. Vs Tamilnadu State Transport Corporation reported in 2014 (5) Scale 479 . The claimant No.2 & 3 have lost their father, therefore, they are entitle for Rs.1,00,000/­ each towards lost of love and affection as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Juju Kuruvila & Ors. Vs Kunjujamma [ 8] M.A.C.P.No.774/2015, [ Judgment ]. Mohan & Others reported in (2013) 9 S.C.C. 166 . The claimant No.4 has lost her son, therefore, she is entitle for an amount of Rs.50,000/­ towards love and affection of her deceased son as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in M. Mansoor and Anr. Vs United India Insurance Co.Ltd., reported in 2013 12 Scale 324 . 18.The claimants are further entitle to an amount of Rs.25,000/­ towards funeral expenses of deceased. Therefore, the claimants are entitle to total compensation of Rs.10,42,000/­. 19.The documents on record shows that the Tata Tempo 407 bearing registration No.MH­20­CT­4552 was owned and driven by respondent No.1 and was insured with respondent No.2, at the time of accident. Therefore, respondent No.1 & 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to claimants. 20.The claimants have received Rs.50,000/­ towards interim compensation under the head of 'No Fault Liability'. Therefore, it will be appropriate to deduct the said amount from total compensation. After deducting the amount of interim compensation, the claimant are entitle to compensation amount of Rs. 9,92,000/­. 21.So far as rate of interest is concern, considering the period of pendency of matter and the amount of compensation, interest @ 7% per annum from the date of petition, till realization of compensation amount would meet the ends of justice. Hence, I answer issue No.4 accordingly and pass the following [ 9] M.A.C.P.No.774/2015, [ Judgment ]. order. O R D E R 1.The petition is allowed. 2.Claimant No.1 to 4 are entitle to get compensation of Rs.10,42,000/­ inclusive of No Fault Liability. 3.Respondent No.1 & 2 do pay an amount of 9 ,92,000/­ exclusive of 'No Fault Liability' amount to claimant No.1 to 4, towards compensation jointly and severally, along with 7% interest per annum, from the date of filing of petition, till realization of entire amount. 4.The amount of 9 ,92,000/­ be appropriated amongst claimant No.1 to 4 as under­ i)Claimant No.1 Rs.3,35,500/­. ii)Claimant No.2 & 3 Rs.2,35,500/­ each. iii)Claimant No.4 Rs. 1,85,500/­. 5.Out of compensation amount payable to claimant No.1, an amount of Rs.2,00,000/­ be invested in Fixed Deposit in her name, in any Nationalized Bank, for the period of two years and remaining amount be paid to her by account payee cheque, on identification. 6.Compensation amount payable to claimant No.2 & 3 be fixed in their names, in any Nationalized Bank, till they attains majority. 7.Out of compensation amount payable to claimant No.4, an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ be invested in Fixed Deposit in her name, in any Nationalized Bank, for the period of one year and remaining amount be paid to her by account payee cheque, on identification. 8.The claimants to pay deficit court fees on excessive compensation of Rs.2,42,000/­. 9.Respondent No.1 & 2 do pay jointly and severally proportionate cost [ 10] M.A.C.P.No.774/2015, [ Judgment ]. of the petition to the claimants and bear their own cost. 10.Award be drawn accordingly.

Bagal, Advocate for Respondent no. 3 ....................................................................................................... J U D G M E N T (Delivered in open court on 16/09/2017) 1)This petition is filed by the claimants for grant of compensation of Rs. 64,13,495 /­ under Section 166 of The Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. 2)Claimant's case in nutshell is as under :­ They have alleged that, deceased was travelling by Car bearing No. MH­20­CS­4086 on 18/11/2014 towards Delhi from Aurangabad alongwith his friends. They reached at village Dhamnod (M.P .) in front of Baba Dhaba. At that time, one truck 3 [MACP No.167/2015] bearing No. MH­18­AA­9409 came from Indor side, (offending direction) in high speed with negligent manner and dashed to the car. In the accident, deceased sustained severe injuries. Immediately, he was shifted to Civil Hospital Dhamnod and died on the same day. 3)They have further contended that, police station Dhamnod lodged FIR under section 279, 337, 304­A of I.P .C. against the truck driver. Druck driver drove the said truck in high speed with negligent manner and he was responsible for the accident. At the time of an accident, deceased was just 44 years. He was business man and Proprietor of “ Bhaktiprasad Stationary Mart”. He was earning Rs. 3,37,365/­ p.a. as per income tax return. He was regular income tax payee. He was the only earning member of his family and all claimants are depend upon him. The deceased was only son of claimant no. 1. Due to untimely death, they suffered mental agony and put on starvation. 4)They have further contended that, respondent no. 1 is owner of truck, no. 2 was driver and no. 3 is the Insurance Company. Therefore, they are jointly and saverally liable to pay compensation. They lastly prayed, claim petition may be allowed. 5)Respondent no. 1 has been duly served summons vide Exh. 26 but failed to appear, thus ex­parte order passed against him. 4 6)Respondent No. 2 has been appeared vide Exh. 29 but failed to file written statement, thus, No W .S. Order passed against him. 7)Respondent no. 3 has filed written statement vide Exh. 16 and denied entire allegations. He has specifically contended that, truck driver had no driving license. The owner and insurance company of the Car have been not impleaded as parties. Accident occurred head on collusion, therefore, contributory negligence needs to be considered. Car driver has driven the car in rash and negligent manner, therefore, car itself has given dash to the truck from front side. Car driver had also no driving license. 8)They have further contended that, claimants have not filed document of age proof of deceased. He was not business man and was not earning Rs. 3,37,365 p.a. There is statutory violation of the conditions of the policy under section 149 (2) of the M.V . Act. Thus, he lastly prayed, claim may be dismissed. 9)From the rival pleadings of the parties, issues are framed vide Exh. 32 and I record my findings against each of them for the reasons given below:­ SR. NO.ISSUES FINDINGS 1)Whether the claimants prove that, the deceased died in the motor vehicular accident dated 18/11/2014 ?: In the affirmative. 5 [MACP No.167/2015] 2)Whether the claimants prove that the deceased died in the accident due to rash and negligent driving of Truck No. MH­18­AA­9409 ?: In the affirmative. 3)What is just and reasonable amount of compensation ?: As per final order. 4)What order and Award? :As per final order.

Book of offending truck (Exh.45) , Insurance Policy ( Exh.46) , Permit ( Exh.47) , Form of National Permit ( Exh.48) , Fitness certificate ( Exh.49) , Income Tax return for the assessment year 2014­15 ( Exh.50) , Adhar Card of deceased ( Exh.51) , Death certificate ( Exh.52) , Form COMP “AA” ( Exh.53) , License of deceased ( Exh.54) , Shop Act License ( Exh.55). 6 AS TO ISSUE NOS.1 & 2 : 11)Issues nos. 1 and 2 are interlinked, therefore, I decide it intermingle to avoid repetitions and for court's convenience. 12)It is the main contention of the claimant that, Vishnupant (deceased) and his friends were going towards Delhi from Aurangabad for business purpose by the Car No. MH­20­CS­ 4086. When the said car came near Baba Dhaba on Indur High Way, at that time, truck bearing No. MH­18­AA­9409 came from offending side in high speed with rash and negligent manner and dashed to him. In the said accident, deceased sustained severe injuries. He was immediately shifted in Government Hospital but he declared dead. 13)In order to show the negligence of respondent no. 2 (truck driver), learned Advocate of claimant has attracted my attention towards FIR, Spot panchanama (Exh. 37 and 41). After accident, Abdul Khan lodged first information report under section 154 of Cr.P .C. The police has registered the crime. During their inquiry, they came to conclusion that, the respondent no. 2 had driven the car in high speed with rash and negligent manner and thereby accident occurred. According to Police, truck driver is the responsible for an accident. 14)Learned Advocate of respondent no. 3 (Insurance Company) has attracted my attention towards spot panchanama 7 [MACP No.167/2015] (Exh. 39). He has argued that, the police has prepared sketch map, wherein the police had shown car went towards right side (wrong side) and hit to the truck. He has also argued that, the truck was at left side, therefore, the truck driver was not in negligence. I am of view that, road repairing work was going on at the spot. There was divider on the road. The traffic was going by the one side. Mere accident took place head on collusion, does not mean that, there should be contributory negligence of the vehicles. I do not admit, the contention raised by the learned Advocate of respondent, because, if there would have been negligence on the part of car driver also, the police could have registred FIR against him also. After all, court has to assess the negligence part on the basis of documents available on record. FIR and spot panchanama are the most important documents. If the truck driver had no fault at the time of accident, the police authority could have lodged FIR against car driver. It is not happened in the present case. It means, truck driver was at fault. Moreover, charge­ sheet came to be filed against truck driver, stating that, he was negligent at the relevant time, therefore, the theory put up of contributory negligence by the learned Advocate of respondent no. 3 is not acceptable in the present scenario. 8 15)Moreover, whatever evidence adduced by the claimant has gone un­challenged and un­rebutted so far respondent no. 1 and 2 are concerned. (Driver and owner of the truck). I am of also view that, driver is the eye witness. He knows very well, how the accident took place. Summon had been duly served to him. He has been appeared through Advocate. Sufficient opportunity has been granted to file say but he did not avail. Even his learned Advocate did not take cross­examination of the claimant. All these conduct goes to show that, the theory put up by the claimant appears to be trustworthy. 16)FIR, Postmortem, seizure panchanama, death certificate, form Corm AA demonstrate that, deceased died in the motor vehicular accident on 18/11/2014 due to rash and negligent driving of truck No. MH­18­AA­9409. Thus, I answer issue No. 1 and 2 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO. 3 : 17)Learned Advocate of claimant has argued that, deceased was a business. He had Stationary Shop by name Bhaktiprasad Stationary Mart and he was earning Rs. 3,37,365/­ p.a. To support his contention, he has filed Shop Act license vide Exh. 55. It shows, he was the owner of the Shop. He has also filed Income Tax Return for the assessment year 2014­15 alongwith 9 [MACP No.167/2015] balance­sheet vide Exh. 50. No doubt, his gross total income shown Rs. 3,37,365/­ p.a. Learned Advocate of respondent No. 3 has attracted my attention towards balance­sheet. He has argued that, his net income under section 44 AD of the Income Tax Act shown as Rs. 86,500/­ p.a. I do agree with his proposition because, in his gross income, the income from other sources (FDR, Bank Interest, Bonds) has been considered. I am of view that, the income from an interest cannot be considered as loss, because, the interest from fixed deposit, Bonds etc. will remain as it is. In short, his legal heirs will get the interest even victim is no more. Therefore, his net income of Rs. 86,500/­ only be considered as yearly income. Thus, his monthly income would be of Rs. 7,200/­. 18)There are four dependents, therefore, in view of Smith Sarla Verma and ors. Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and Ors. Reported in 2009 (2) T.A.C. 677 (Supreme Court ) there would be 1/4th deduction. As per Adhar Card (Exh. 51) the birth year of deceased is 1969 and an accident took place on 18/11/2014. Thus, his age would be around 45 years. Therefore, in view of Sarla Verma's Case (cited supra), the multiplier “14” will be applicable. It has come on record that, respondent no. 1 was the owner of the truck as per RC Book Exh. 45, respondent no. 2 was driver. The said truck was duly insured with respondent 10 no. 3. (Insurance Policy Exh. 46). Therefore, all respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation. 19)Learned Advocate of claimant has argued that, deceased was the business man, therefore, future prospectus may be granted. [(Relied upon Fundabai Vijaysingh Kakarwal Vs. Kishor Namdeo Sadashive 2009 (12) LJSOFT (SC) 458 ] I am of view that, the ratio laid down in the above citation is not applicable, because, claimant has not filed cogent document to that effect. He has filed income tax return of the year 2014­15 only. According to him, claimant was paying income tax regularly, then, who has prevented him to produce the same. To award future prospectus, claimant has to prove his income gradually increased. Mere income of one year has been shown, does not mean that, he is entitled for future prospectus. 20)Considering the circumstances, I calculate the compensation as follows : Sr. No. Heads Calculations Rupees 1 Yearly income of deceased : Rs.7,200 p.m. X 12 = 86,400/­ 3 1/4th deduction as a personal and living expenses : Rs. 86,400 – 21,600 =64,800/­ 4 Compensation after applying multiplier of “14” : Rs. 64,800 x 14 = 9,07,200/­ 11 [MACP No.167/2015] 5 Loss of consortium 1,00,000 6 Loss of love and affection. 1,00,000 7 Loss of estate 1,00,000 8 Funeral­expenses 25,000 Total = 12,32,200/­ Thus, the claimants are entitled compensation of Rs. 12,32,200/­/­ (Rs. Twelve Lacs, Thirty Two Thousand and Two Hundred Only). 21) The claimants have requested to grant interest @ Rs.18% per annum. I am of the view that, the said interest would be exorbitant. Instead of that, as per Kanhsingh Vs Tukaram 2015 (2) T.A.C. 689 (Supreme Court) the interest @ Rs.9% per annum would be proper and reasonable. In view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Khenyei versus New India Assurance Company Limited and others. The claimant can recover the aforesaid compensation from the respondents jointly and severally. Thus, I answer issue No. 3 in the affirmative and proceed to pass the following order:­ ORDER 1) The claim­petition is allowed with proportionate costs. 12 2) The Respondent nos. 1 to 3 are held liable jointly and severally to pay the compensation. of 12,32,200/­ (Rs. Twelve Lacs, Thirty Two Thousand and Two Hundred Only) to the claimants with interest at the rate of 9% per annum from the date of petition, i.e. 24/02/2015, till realization of the entire payment, after deducting the NFL amount, if paid. 3)Out of awarded compensation, an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ (Rs. One Lacs Only) be given to applicant no. 1 Malti and Rs. 1,32,200/­ (Rs. One Lac Thirty Two Thousand and Two Hundred Only) be given to claimant No. 2 Bhagyashree. 4)Remaining compensation amount of Rs. 10,00,000/­ (Rs. Ten Lacs Only) be invested in fixed deposit in the name of Bhagyashree Narayan Narsikar (mother of minor) in any nationalized bank for five years for the welfare of her children (claimant nos. 3 and 4). 5)An award be drawn accordingly.

J U D G M E N T [ Delivered on 2nd May, 2017 ] The Present petition is filed for compensation under Section 166 of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, on account of unfortunate death of Ganesh Manikrao Kakde R/o H.No.1­11­780, Maganpura, New Mondha, District Nanded in a motor vehicle accident. The claimants are legal representatives of deceased Ganesh Manikrao Kakde who lost his life on 03.03.2014 because of injuries sustained by him in motor vehicle accident. Claimant No.1 is widow, claimant No.2 & 3 are major children, claimant No.4 is minor son and claimant No.5 is mother of deceased Ganesh Manikrao Kakde. 2.Brief facts of the case­ It is the case of claimants that on 03.03.2014 at about 19.25 hours deceased Ganesh Manikrao Kakde was proceeding by walking near Cambridge 3 M.A.C.P.No.129/2015, [Judgment]. School, Jalna Road, Aurangabd. At that time, S.T.Bus bearing registration No.MH­20­BL­2386 came in high speed, rash and negligent manner without following traffic rules and gave dash to the deceased because of which the deceased fell down on the road and sustained severe head injuries and other injuries on various parts of the body. The deceased was immediately admitted in Government Medical College & Hospital, Aurangabad, during the course of medical treatment, he expired on 03.03.2014. 3.On the basis of report lodged by Shrikant Ganesh Kakde dated 04.03.2014, MIDC Cidco Police Station registered offence vide Crime No.I­ 39/2014 under Section 279, 338, 304­A of IPC against the driver of S.T.Bus bearing registration No.MH­20­BL­2386 i.e. respondent No.2. 4.The claimants further contended that that the deceased was in service with Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd., Nanded. The claimants further contended that the deceased was 47 years of age and working with Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. He was drawing monthly salary of Rs.37,922/­, at the time of accident. The claimants further contended that the respondent No.1 is the owner of offending S.T.Bus bearing registration No.MH­20­BL­2386 and it was driven by respondent No.2, at the time of accident. Therefore, respondent No.1 & 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the claimants. Thus, the claimants have claimed total compensation to the tune of of Rs.80,00,000/­ 4 M.A.C.P.No.129/2015, [Judgment]. including the compensation under other conventional heads. 5.Respondent No.1 filed his written statement at Exh­15. They denied that the accident has happened because of rash and negligent driving of respondent No.1. They further contended that the drivers and conductors of respondent No.1 are well trained and are well aware about the safety of people who travel on road. They further denied the age, income of the deceased and submitted that the petition be rejected. 6.Respondent No.2 filed his written statement at Exh­25. He denied that the accident has happened because of his negligency. He further denied the age and income of the deceased and submitted that the petition be rejected. 7.On the basis of rival pleadings of the parties, I have framed following issues below Exh­28 and I answer them for the reasons stated below. I S S U E S F I N D I N G S 1.Whether the claimants prove that deceased Ganesh Manikrao Kakde died in motor vehicle accident held on 03.03.2014 ? .. Yes. 2.Whether the claimants prove that the accident occurred because of rash and negligent driving of respondent No.2 ? .. Yes. 3.Whether the respondents prove that the deceased suddenly came across the S.T.Bus bearing registration No. 5 M.A.C.P.No.129/2015, [Judgment]. MH­20­BL­2386, in negligent manner because of which the accident occurred ? .. No. 4.Whether claimants are entitle for compensation ? If yes, to what extent and from whom ? .. Rs.62,71,559/­@7% interest per annum from respondent No.1 & 2 jointly and severally. 5.What order and award ? .. Claim is partly allowed. R E A S O N S As to Issue No.1 to 3 : 8.In order to substantiate the contentions raised in the petition, claimant No.2 Shrikant Kakde deposed before this court as CW1 by filing his affidavit of evidence at Exh­28­A and also examined Rajendra Surendra Brahme, Accounts Officer of B.S.N.L. as CW2 at Exh­36. Claimants have placed on record certified copies of relevant police papers pertaining to the accident in question. They are F.I.R. at Exh­29, Spot Panchanama at Exh­30, Postmortem Report at Exh­31, Inquest Panchanama at Exh­32, Form Compound­AA at Exh­ 32/A, Salary Certificate for the month of February, 2014 at Exh­37 and filed evidence close Pursis at Exh­38. 9.Respondent No.1 & 2 did not lead any evidence and filed their evidence close Pursis at Exh­39. 6 M.A.C.P.No.129/2015, [Judgment]. 10.Heard Learned Advocate Shri M.A.Madni for claimants and Shri F.R.Shaikh for respondent No.1 & 2. 11.Learned advocate appearing for claimants submitted that the police papers pertaining to the accident in question clearly indicates that respondent No.2 was driving his S.T.Bus bearing registration No.MH­20­BL­2386 in rash and negligent manner and gave dash to the deceased. He further submitted that respondent No.1 is the owner of offending S.T.Bus and the same was driven by respondent No.2. Therefore, respondent No.1 & 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the claimants. 12.Having considered the submissions made on behalf of the claimants, I have gone through the oral as well as documentary evidence placed on record by the claimants. It is seen that on 03.03.2014 deceased sustained injuries in a motor accident and died on the same day. The cause of death shown in postmortem report at Exh­31 is “Head Injury”. It is seen from the testimony of CW1 and copy of report at Exh­29, Spot Panchanama at Exh­30 that respondent No.2 was driving his S.T.Bus bearing registration No.MH­20­BL­2386 in rash and negligent manner on the right side of the road and gave dash to the deceased. The respondent No.2 driver of offending S.T.Bus has not stepped into witness­ box, so as to rebut the testimony of CW1 and documents filed by the claimants on record. Hence, I answer Issue No.1 & 2 as 'Yes' and Issue No.3 as 'No'. 7 M.A.C.P.No.129/2015, [Judgment]. Issue No.4 : 13.The claimant No.2 in his affidavit of evidence has deposed that the deceased Ganesh Manikrao Kakde was working with Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd., Nanded, at the time of accident. He was permanent employee and was drawing monthly salary of Rs.37,922/­. In support of his contentions, he has examined Rajendra Surendra Bramhe as CW2 who is the Accounts Officer of B.S.N.L., Nanded. He deposed that the deceased Ganesh Manikrao Kakde was working as telecom mechanic in B.S.N.L. and used to draw gross salary of Rs.37,922/­. He further deposed that an amount of Rs.9,122/­ was deducted as income tax for financial year 2012­2014 from the salary of deceased. Perusal of salary slip at Exh­37 shows that an amount of Rs.200/­ was deducted from the salary of deceased as professional tax. Therefore, it would be appropriate to deduct an amount of Rs.961/­ from monthly income of the deceased as tax paid by him. After deducting Rs.961/­ from Rs.37,922/­, the monthly income of the deceased comes to Rs.36,961/­ and the annual income of the deceased comes to Rs.4,43,532/­. 14.It appears from the record that at the time of death of deceased there were five dependents on the deceased. Hence, 1/5 of his income is deducted towards his personal expenses. After deducting 1/5 from his annual income, loss of earning of deceased comes to Rs.3,54,826/­. 8 M.A.C.P.No.129/2015, [Judgment]. 15.CW1 has deposed that the age of deceased at the time of accident was 47 years but has not filed any documentary evidence, in support of the age of deceased. Hence, the age of deceased mentioned in Postmortem Report at Exh­ 31 and Inquest Panchanama at Exh­32 is taken into consideration. The age of deceased mentioned in Exh­31 & 32 is 47 years. Therefore, the multiplier of 13 is applied as per the guidelines of Hon'ble Supreme Court passed in Smt. Sarla Verma Vs Delhi Transportation Corporation and another reported in AIR 2009 (SC) 3104. After applying multiplier of 13, the loss of dependency comes to Rs.46,12,738/­. 16.It appears from the record that the deceased was permanent employee of B.S.N.L. which is on Government undertaking. Hence, 30% of his loss of earning is granted to the claimants towards future prospect of deceased. After adding 30% of loss of dependency, the total dependency of the claimants comes to Rs.59,96,559/­. 17.Claimant No.1 has lost her husband and therefore she is entitle for an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ towards consortium. She is also entitle for an amount of Rs.1,00,000/­ as loss of estate as held by Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kala Devi & Ors. Vs Bhagwan das Chauhan & Ors. Reported in 2014(4) T.A.C. 673 (SC). Claimant No.5 has lost her son. Therefore, she is entitle for an amount of Rs.50,000/­ towards loss of love and affection of her deceased son as held by the 9 M.A.C.P.No.129/2015, [Judgment]. Hon'ble Supreme Court in M. Mansoor and Anr. Vs United India Insurance Co.Ltd., reported in 2013 12 Scale 324 . The claimants are further entitle to an amount of Rs.25,000/­ towards funeral expenses of the deceased. The claimants are entitled to total compensation of Rs.62,71,559/­. 18.Taking into consideration the pendency of petition and the amount of compensation, it will be appropriate to grant 7% interest per annum on compensation amount, from the date of filing of petition till the realization of entire amount of compensation. Hence, I answer Issue No.4 accordingly and proceed to pass following order. O R D E R 1.The petition is partly allowed. 2.Claimant No.1 to 5 are entitle to total compensation of Rs.62,71,559/­. 3.Respondent No.1 & 2 do pay an amount of Rs.62,71,559/­ to claimant No.1 to 5, towards compensation jointly and severally, along with 7% interest per annum, from the date of filing of petition, till realisation of entire amount. 4.The amount of Rs.62,71,559/­ be appropriated amongst claimant No.1 to 5 as under­ i)Claimant No.1 ­ Rs.14,04,315/­ ii)Claimant No.2, 3 & 4 – Rs.12,04,311/­ each. iii)Claimant No.5 ­ Rs.12,54,311/­. 5.Out of compensation amount payable to claimant No.1, an amount of Rs.9,00,000/­ be invested in Fixed Deposit in her name, in any Nationalized Bank, for the period of two years and remaining 10 M.A.C.P.No.129/2015, [Judgment]. amount be paid to her by account payee cheque, on identification. 6.Out of compensation amount payable to claimant No.2, 3 & 4, an amount of Rs.6,00,000/­ each be invested in Fixed Deposit in their names, in any Nationalized Bank, for the period of two years and remaining amount be paid to them by account payee cheque, on identification. 7.Out of compensation amount payable to claimant No.5, an amount of Rs.6,00,000/­ be invested in Fixed Deposit in her name, in any Nationalized Bank, for the period of two years and remaining amount be paid to her by account payee cheque, on identification. 8.Respondent No.1 & 2 do pay jointly and severally proportionate cost of the petition to the claimants and bear their own cost. 9.Award be drawn accordingly.

The petition is allowed. R E A S O N S ISSUE NO.1 AND 2 : 6.On behalf of both petitioners Smt.Kalpanabai (PW1) who is mother of deceased Dadarao has adduced her oral evidence. In support of her oral testimony they have produced certified copies (Exh.21 to 25) respectively of FIR, spot panchnama, inquest panchnama, AA Form and P.M.Notes. The photocopies (Exh.26 to 28) respectfully of insurance cover notes and R.C.Book of the Cruiser Jeep, so also of driving licence of its driver­cum owner (respondent No.2) are also produced. 7.Both respondents have not adduced either oral or documentary evidence. Heard learned Advocates for both parties. 8.Admittedly, respondent No.2 was the owner of the Cruiser Jeep involved in the accident which was insured with respondent No.1. It is also indisputed fact that at the time of accident respondent No.2 was driving said Jeep. It is also not in dispute that deceased Dadarao was a passenger in the Ape­rickshaw involved in the accident. .. 5 .. MACP No.381/2015 (Judgment) 9. PW1 who is the mother of the deceased Dadarao did not witness the accident. Her oral evidence and the contents of certified copies (Exh.21 to 25), of FIR, spot panchnama, inquest panchnama, AA Form and P.M.Notes, are carefully read in order to ascertain the truth regarding the cause of accident. In its result, it is established that before the accident the Cruiser Jeep was coming in high speed from wrong side of the road had dashed the Ape­rickshaw due to which it was over turned at the spot located near Jaibhimwadi. No rebuttal evidence on behalf of respondent No.2 who himself was driving the said Jeep makes me to believe that because of his negligent and faulty driving the accident of said two vehicles was resulted. 10.It is also established in the evidence on record that death of deceased Dadarao was resulted because of the grievous injuries he had received on his person in the accident in question. Hence, I have the reason to hold that issue Nos.1 and 2 are proved, and answer them in affirmative. ISSUE NO.3 : 11.The petitioners have not produced any document about the date of birth of deceased Dadarao. However, PW1 who is his mother has categorical stated that he was 18 years old at the time of his accident. In the inquest panchnama (Exh.23), and P.M. Cum provisional cause of death certificate (Exh.24) his age is shown as was 18 years at the time of his death. For want of rebuttal evidence, I hold that he was of that age at the time of .. 6 .. MACP No.381/2015 (Judgment) accident. 12.PW1 has stated that her deceased son was doing business of selling ready made garments of children in weekly bazzars and earning Rs.10 to 15 thousand. Except her bare words there is no any other proof regarding his quantum of monthly income. But, she being his mother and he being her major son of 18 years, I safely believe her words that he was selling ready made garments in weekly bazzar. In the result, I assume that he was earning Rs.5,000/­ per month by doing said business. 13.Considering deceased Dadarao was a bachelor, I respectfully follow the law laid down by the Honourable Supreme Court in its latest landmark judgment in National Insurance Co. Ltd. V/s. Pranay Shetthy and others, Special leave Petition (Civil) No. 25590/2014 with other leave petitions, which was decided on 31st October, 2017. 14. In the decision (supra), the Honourable Apex Court has ruled that the age of the deceased should be the basis for applying the multiplier. Hence, I deem it fit and proper to apply multiplicand “18” as deceased Dadarao was in the age group of 15 to 25 years. Similarly, the deceased being self employed , I deem it just and proper to give the benefit of future prospects (40%) also, as held in said decision. Considering all these aspects, I proceed to make computation of just compensation as follows: .. 7 .. MACP No.381/2015 (Judgment) Computation of the compensation 1 Monthly Notional income of the deceased Rs.5,000/­ 2.Minus 50% towards personal expenses as he was bachelor .Rs.2,500/­Rs.2,500/­ 3.Plus future prospects 40% Rs.2,000/­ (Rs.2,500/­ + Rs.2,000/­)Rs.4,500/­ 4.Annual income Rs.4,500/­x12Rs.54,000/­ 5.Multiplicand as per the Judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sarla Verma Case.18 6.Loss of dependency Rs. 54,000/­ x 18Rs.9,72,000/­. 7.Loss of estate Rs.15,000/­ 8.Love and affection Rs.25,000/­ to petitioner Nos.1 and 2 (parents) each as per decision in Neeta Vs.

It is contended that, the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the claimant himself. Lastly, it is prayed to dismiss the petition. 10.Following issues are framed at Exh. 24. I record my findings thereon for the reasons stated thereafter. ISSUES FINDINGS 1.Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of Maruti Eeco Car bearing registration No.MH-14-CK- 6511 by its driver ?In the affirmative 2.Whether the claimant sustained permanent disability due to the injuries suffered by him in said accident ?In the negative 3.Whether the claimant is entitled to get compensation ? If yes, from whom and to what extent ?In the affirmative, as per final order 4.What order ? As per final order. 6 M.A.C.P. No.139/2015 [Judgment] REASONS 11.The claimant, in support of his claim, has filed his affidavit of examination-in-chief at Exh. 25. The claimant has also examined his witness Dr. P.S.Jaiswal (CW-2) at Exh.29 and Pritesh Parasmal Raka (CW-3) at Exh.46 and closed his oral evidence vide pursis at Exh. 50. In addition to this, the claimant has filed on record certified copies of FIR (Exh.31), Form Comp.B (Exh.30), Spot panchnama (Exh.32), Motor driving license of respondent No.1 (Exh.36), Certificate of registration of the offending vehicle (Exh.37), Insurance cover note (Exh.40), Form Comp.AA (Exh.41), Discharge card issued by Kamalnayan Bajaj Hospital (Exh.33), Authority letter (Exh.47), IPD Bill/Cash receipt of Kamalnayan Bajaj Hospital, Aurangabad (Exh.48) and Bills of Kamalnayan Bajaj Hospital (collectively Exh.49). 12.On behalf of respondent Nos.1 and 2, respondent No.1 has filed his affidavit of examination-in-chief at Exh.35 and closed their evidence vide purshis at Exh.38. Respondent No.3 did not lead any oral evidence. AS TO ISSUE NO.1 :- 13.The claimant deposed as per the petition in his 7 M.A.C.P. No.139/2015 [Judgment] affidavit of examination-in-chief. During his cross-examination by respondents, nothing could be elicited to falsify occurrence of the accident. The claimant denied all adverse suggestions given by Advocates for the respondents. 14.Respondent No.1 in his affidavit of examination-in- chief deposed that, he alongwith his wife were proceeding towards Aurangabad from Pune to attend marriage. He was driving the offending vehicle. He further deposed that, two persons came from Fauji Dhaba on motorcycle in high speed on the road and gave dash to his vehicle, and therefore, the accident took place. He took the injured persons to City Care Hospital, Aurangabad. 15.During cross-examination of this witness by Advocate for the claimant, he admitted that, respondent No.2 is owner of the offending vehicle and he is driver on it. He further deposed that, at the time of accident, injured persons were travelling from opposite side of his vehicle. 16. Respondent No.1 has for the first time contended in his cross-examination that, the claimant alongwith pillion rider 8 M.A.C.P. No.139/2015 [Judgment] were coming from opposite side on motorcycle. However, spot panchnama (Exh.32) shows that, Fauji Dhaba is located towards western side of Ahmednagar to Aurangabad road. Admittedly, both the claimant and respondent No.1 were travelling in the same direction i.e. towards Aurangabad. Therefore, testimony of respondent No.1 that, the claimant at the relevant time came from opposite direction on his motorcycle and gave dash to his vehicle, is not reliable. Respondent No.1 further admitted in his cross- examination that, he did not make complaint to higher police officers for not registering his complaint by concerned police. That apart, after the accident, concerned police investigated the case and registered crime against driver of the offending vehicle i.e. respondent No.1. Said charges are not challenged by respondent No.1. Registration of offence against respondent No.1 prima facie shows his negligence. Spot panchnama (Exh.32) shows involvement of the offending vehicle in the accident. Police papers filed on record are not denied by the respondents. Therefore, it is held that, the accident occurred due to rash and negligent driving of the offending vehicle by respondent No. 1. Hence, I answer issue No. 1 accordingly in the affirmative. 9 M.A.C.P. No.139/2015 [Judgment] AS TO ISSUE NO. 2 :- 17.In order to prove permanent disability sustained in the accident, the claimant has examined Dr.P.S. Jaiswal at Exh. 29. He deposed that, on 06.02.2015 he clinically examined the claimant, saw his old papers. He found that, the claimant sustained fracture neck femur right side intertrochanteric type. He was operated for internal fixation by nail. Now the claimant walks with limp on right leg. He has scar of operation at right thigh measuring 6 cm. The claimant has shortening of right leg by 2 cm. Movements of right knee is restricted by 20 degree. He cannot squatt or sit cross-legged. The claimant has permanent disability of 22% by Mc-Bride Scale and accordingly he issued permanent disability certificate (Exh.30) to the claimant. 18.The above witness admitted in his cross-examination that, the claimant was in government service and was doing sitting work. The claimant can do sitting work even after the disability. 19.The claimant has admitted in his cross-examination that, he took medical leave after the accident for his treatment and he received payment of said leave. He further admitted that, he 10 M.A.C.P. No.139/2015 [Judgment] received retirement benefits. It makes clear that, income of the claimant is not affected due to accidental injuries suffered by him. In the circumstances, it is held that, the claimant has not suffered functional disability due to the injuries sustained by him in the accident. Accordingly, I answer Issue No. 2 in the negative. AS TO ISSUE NO. 3 :- 20. The claimant in his evidence (Exh.25) deposed that, before the accident, he was serving as a junior clerk in the office of Executive Engineer, Irrigation Research Division, Aurangabad and was getting salary of Rs.38,000/- per month. Now the claimant is retired from his service and gets monthly pension. As discussed earlier, the claimant has also received the payments of medical leave that he took during the period of hospitalization and medical treatment. 21.The claimant has deposed that, after the accident, he was admitted into Kamalnayan Bajaj Hospital for 12 to 15 days. Even after discharge, he took treatment thereat as an outdoor patient. After discharge, for the period of four to five months, he could not follow his ordinary pursuits. He appointed one personal 11 M.A.C.P. No.139/2015 [Judgment] assistant on payment and was dependent on him for his daily work. He hired one auto-rickshaw to attend his office. The discharge card of Kamalnayan Bajaj Hospital (Exh.33) shows that, the claimant was admitted thereat on 25.05.2014 and was discharged on 09.06.2014. It means, for about 16 days, the claimant took treatment in the hospital as an indoor patient. In order to prove medical expenses, the claimant has examined Pritesh Raka(CW-3), who is Billing Assistant of Kamalnayan Bajaj Hospital, Aurangabad. He deposed that, Kamalnayan Bajaj Hospital received amount of Rs.1,31,468/- from the claimant vide IPD Bill/Cash receipt of Kamalnayan Bajaj Hospital (Exh.48). This witness also deposed that, amount of Rs.7,683/- was received from the claimant towards medicine bills of the hospital (collectively Exh.49). Therefore, the claimant is entitled to receive said amount of hospital bill and medicine bills. 22.As discussed earlier, it is not proved that, the claimant has sustained functional disability due to the accidental injuries. However, as per Discharge Card (Exh.33), it is proved that, the claimant took medical treatment as an indoor patient at 12 M.A.C.P. No.139/2015 [Judgment] Kamalnayan Bajaj Hospital for a considerable period. During the period of hospitalization, the claimant must have suffered pain and sufferings. He would not have been able to attend his daily routine during said period. So also, due to loss of injuries and physical discomfort, the claimant may suffer some inconvenience in future. For all these reasons, I find it just and proper to award lump sum amount of compensation to the claimant under following heads. 1] For pain and sufferings Rs. 50,000/- 2] For Hospital Bill Rs.1,31,468/- 3] Medicine Bills Rs. 07,683/- 4] For attendance charges, Rs. 25,000/- special diet and transportation charges 5] For future inconvenience Rs. 25,000/- ____________ Total -Rs. 2,39,151/- ____________ Thus, the claimant is entitled to get compensation of Rs.2,39,151/- 23.As per police papers on record, respondent No. 1 is driver, respondent No. 2 is owner and respondent No.3 is insurer of the offending vehicle at the time of accident. Therefore, 13 M.A.C.P. No.139/2015 [Judgment] respondent Nos.1 to 3 are held jointly and severally liable to pay the amount of compensation to the claimant. Accordingly, I answer issue No.3 as mentioned against it and in answer of issue No.4, pass following order. ORDER The Petition is partly allowed with proportionate costs as under :- 1]The respondent Nos. 1 to 3 do pay Rs.2,39,151/- (Rs.

Tandulje – Advocate for the claimants Mr.R.R. Imle – Advocate for Respondent No.1 Mr.M.R. Deshmukh – Advocate for Respondent No.2 Mr.S.D. Gaikwad – Adv. for Respondent Nos.3 and 4 *********************************************** J U D G M E N T [Delivered on this 26th day of October, 2017] 1]Claimants have filed this claim petition for claiming compensation amount of Rs.50,00,000/­ under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act as against Respondent Nos.1 and 2. Rest of the respondents are parents of deceased – Baleshwar Daroga Yadav. 2]In brief, the facts of claimants' case can be summarized as follows :­ Rinadevi & ors. Vs. Ambadas & ors. 3 Judgment – MACP No.756/2015 On 07.09.2015 ata bout 10.30 pm deceased Baleshwar s/o Daroga Yadav, aged about 38 years was traveling on Aurangabad to Nagar road. He meet with an accident at village Rahimpur phata. On that day deceased Baleshwar s/o Daroga Yadav was proceeding from Pandharpur Taluka­District Aurangabad and traveling by Tavera Jeep bearing No. MH­20­AS­ 4089 to Pune. That time the offending vehicle Maruti Swift Car bearing No. MH­21­S­1033 owned by Respondent No.1 – Ambadas Tukaram Jatde, driven by Ashok Panditrao Thorat, gave dash to Tavera Jeep wherein deceased was traveling. As such deceased Baleshwar s/o Daroga Yadav had expired on that day. 3]Deceased was the Centering Contractor, aged about 38 years. His income was Rs.2,50,000/­ to Rs.3,00,000/­ per year. Respondent No.1 is the owner of the offending vehicle – Swift Car. Respondent No.2 is the insurance company – insurer. As the driver of the offending vehicle had expired, hence, he is not added as a party ­ respondent. 4]Claimant no.1 Rinadevi w/o Baleshwar Yadav is the wife of deceased Baleshwar s/o Daroga Yadav. Claimant no.2 – Punamkumari D/o Baleshwar Yadav and Claimant no.3 – Kusumkumar D/o Baleshwar Yadav are the minor daughters of 4 deceased Baleshwar s/o Daroga Yadav. Claimant no.4 – Purushottamkumar s/o Baleshwar Yadav and claimant no.5 – Sonukumar s/o Baleshwar Yadav are the sons of deceased Baleshwar s/o Daroga Yadav. Respondent Nos.3 and 4 are the parents of deceased Baleshwar s/o Daroga Yadav, and in laws of claimant no.1. 5]According to claimants, the driver of the offending vehicle namely Ashok Panditrao Thorat had driven the offending vehicle – Maruti Swift Car No. MH­21­S­1033 in rash and negligent manner and caused the accident and also held responsible for the death of deceased Baleshwar s/o Daroga Yadav. As such claimants have claimed an amount of Rs.50,00,000/­ towards compensation amount for themselves and for respondent nos.3 and 4 (parents of the deceased) and submitted to allow this claim with 18% interest. 6]In response to the case of claimants, respondent no.1 appeared through learned counsel Shri R.R. Imle and filed written statement vide exh.18. Respondent No.1 denied the liability to pay the compensation to the claimants as well as denied the age of the deceased, earning of the deceased. Further, Respondent No.1 denies that, deceased Ashok Panditrao Thorat was driving Swift Car bearing No. MH­21­S­1033 in rash and negligent manner. Rinadevi & ors. Vs. Ambadas & ors. 5 Judgment – MACP No.756/2015 According to Respondent No.1, crime is registered against deceased Ashok Panditrao Thorat. According to Respondent No.1, the offending vehicle – Swift Car bearing No. MH­21­S­1033 was validly insured with Respondent No.2 – insurance company. There is no breach of any policy condition. Said offending vehicle was driven by driver / person, who was having effective driving licence. The crime is falsely registered against deceased Ashok s/o Popatrao Thorat. Hence, insurer – Respondent No.2 is liable to pay the compensation, if any, and lastly, submitted to dismiss the claim to his extent. 7]Respondent No.2 – insurance company – insurer appeared and filed its detailed written statement at exh.13. Respondent – insurance company has denied and resisted the claim of the claimants including age, income of the deceased. Further, it is contended that, driver of the Swift Car had no valid and effective driving licence at the time of accident. The driver of the offending vehicle was not holding valid driving licence. There is a breach of terms and conditions of the policy as the Swift Car driver of the offending vehicle was not having any valid licence. The claim of claimants is of excessive and exorbitant amount. Respondent is not jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation. It is denied that, the alleged accident occurred due 6 to sole negligence on the part of the Swift Car driver. The insurance of Swift Car is under verification. Lastly, the insurance company submits to dismiss the claim of the claimants. 8]Respondent No.3 – Daroga s/o Mathura Yadav and Respondent No.4 – Sondevi w/o Daroga Yadav are the parents of deceased Baleshwar s/o Daroga Yadav. They appeared through learned counsel Shri S.D. Gaikwad but failed to file their written statement. Hence, claim proceeded exparte / no WS as against Respondent Nos.3 and 4. Hence, there is no WS on behalf of Respondent Nos.3 and 4. 9]Considering the rival contentions and pleadings of both parties, I have framed issues at exh.19 which are being reproduced as follows, I record my findings with reasons thereon as follows :­ ISSUES FINDINGS 1]Whether due to rash and negligent driving of the motor vehicle bearing registration No. MH­21­S­1033 the accident occurred and as a consequence thereof, deceased Baleshwar s/o Daroga Yadav died ? In the affirmative. 2]Whether the claimants are entitled to get compensation ? If yes, what should be the quantum ? In the affirmative. 3]Who is liable to pay compensation ? As per final order . 4]What order and award ? As per final order. R E A S O N S Rinadevi & ors. Vs. Ambadas & ors. 7 Judgment – MACP No.756/2015 10]Heard argument of learned counsel Shri K.S. Tandulje for the claimants and argument of learned counsel Shri M.R. Deshmukh for the insurance company – Respondent No.2. No response from Respondent No.1 – owner of the offending vehicle as well Respondent Nos.3 and 4 also not responding hence, no argument. 11]Learned counsel Shri K.S. Tandulje for the claimants relied on the following rulings :­ 1}2013(3) T.A.c. 558 (Del.) Delhi High Court Surinder Kaur Chhabra and others Vs. Kusum and others 2}[2009 AC 305 (SC)] Supreme Court Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another. 3}2010(3) T.A.C. 769 (S.C.) Supreme Court Arun Kumar Agrawal and another Vs. National Insurance Company and others 4}2015 CJ(SC) 223 Supreme Court Asha Verman & ors. Vs. Maharaj Singh & ors. 5}2012 STPL 14070 SC ­ Santosh Devi Vs. National Insurance Company Ltd. and others 6}2008(2) T.A.C. 620 (A.P.) Andhra Pradesh High Court Divisional Manager, United Inida Insurance Co.Ltd. Vs. Narala Venkata Subbamma and others I have gone through aforesaid rulings carefully and considered while deciding this claim as a valuable guidelines for me with due respect. 8 AS TO ISSUE NO.1 :­ 12]In order to establish the claim, claimants have led oral evidence by examining claimant no.1 Rinadevi w/o Baleshwar Yadav vide exh.28 and she is testified. She was cross examined by the respondents side. 13]Claimants relied on the documentary evidence i.e. true copies of complaint vide exh.32, FIR exh.33, spot panchanmaa exh.34, inquest panchanama exh.35, police report exh.36, receipt about acknowledgment of accepting dead body exh.37, provisional postmortem report exh.38, better particulars of offending vehicle exh.39, insurance policy of offending vehicle exh.40, letter to Medical Officer, Government Hospital, Aurangabad exh.41, AA Form exh.42, verified copies of aadhar of deceased exh.43, election card of deceased exh.44, aadhar card of claimant no.1 exh.45, dead body transportation charges ambulance bill exh.46, From No.16­A issued by Nagpal Construction vide Article – A, certified copy of sale deed stands in the name of deceased vide Article – B, copy of sale deed vide Article – C and xerox copy of driving licence of driver of offending vehicle vide Article – D. 14]From the police case papers particularsly the Rinadevi & ors. Vs. Ambadas & ors. 9 Judgment – MACP No.756/2015 statement of complainant Chandkhan Ahmedkhan vide exh.32, it is clearly mentioned that, the offending vehicle – Maruti Swift Car bearing No. MH­21­S­1033 was involved in the accident and driver of offending vehicle had expired in an accident. It is further mentioned in this statement in the form of complaint that, driver of the offending vehicle Swift Car was responsible for the accident as he driven his offending vehicle Swift Car in rash and negligent manner. 15]In the oral evidence of claimant no.1 Rinadevi w/o Baleshwar Yadav, she has categorically deposed about rash and negligent driving at the hands of deceased driver of the offending vehicle owned by Respondent No.1 Ambadas Tukaram Jatde. Spot panchanama on record vide exh.34 clearly disclosed that, deceased driver of the offending vehicle was rash and negligent as it is well established that, deceased driver of the offending vehicle Swift Car was rash and negligent and due to his rash and negligent driving the accident occurred and also deceased Baleshwar s/o Daroga Yadav meet with an accident and expired in an accident. Hence, issue no.1 is proved at all therefore, I answer the same in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NOS.2 AND 3 :­ 10 16]No doubt, claimants have claimed the compensation under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act as against the insured – Respondent No.1 and insurer – Respondent No.2. Admittedly, the offending vehicle is involved in the accident and furthermore, deceased Baleshwar s/o Daroga Yadav had expired vide spot panchanama exh.34, inquest panchanama exh.35 and report of police to the Civil Surgeon vide exh.36 and postmortem report exh.38. The cause of death of deceased Baleshwar s/o Daroga Yadav is due to head injury as per final cause of death certificate exh.38. 17]Moreover, from police case papers on record i.e. the insurance policy vide exh.40 and AA Form exh.42, it clearly goes to show and prove that, Respondent No.1 Ambadas Tukaram Jatde is the owner of the offending vehicle – Swift Car No. MH­21­S­1033. The insurance policy and the better particulars of the vehicle vide exh.39 and 40 as well as the Form AA goes to prove that, the offending vehicle is owned by Respondent No.1 – insured – Ambadas Tukaram Jatde and that offending vehicle was validly insured to the insurance company ­Respondent No.2 for the period from 11.04.2015 to 10.04.2016. The accident had taken place on 07.09.2015. As such policy covers the risk and accident. Rinadevi & ors. Vs. Ambadas & ors. 11 Judgment – MACP No.756/2015 18]No doubt, Respondent Nos.1 and 2 insured and insurer are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation to the claimants and Respondent Nos.3 and 4 (being parents of deceased) under section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act. 19]Now so as to quantify the claim of claimants and determine quantum of the compensation amount, the Tribunal has to consider the age of the deceased and proper multiplier as well as the income of deceased prior to the accident. 20]Now let us assess the income of the deceased. Now in this case claimants have come up with a specific case that, the income of the deceased was Rs.2,50,000/­ to Rs.3,00,000/­ per year from the business – Centering Contractor. In the instant case except her bare words, there is no specific and clear evidence to prove the income of the deceased as Rs.2,50,000/­ to Rs.3,00,000/­. In absence of evidence in this regard notional income of Rs.4,500/­ per month can be considered as per the ruling of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Ramchandrappa Vs. Manager, Royal Sundaram Alliance Insurance Company Ltd. 2011(4) T.A.C. 1 (S.C.) . 21]The dependents are in all seven i.e. claimant nos.1 to 12 5 and parents of the deceased – Respondent Nos.3 and 4. Hence, deduction from the income of the deceased towards the personal and living expenses of the deceased can be considered as 1/5th as per the ruling of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Smt.Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another reported in 2009 AC 305 (SC). 22]As per copy of Aadhar card vide exh.43, date of birth of the deceased is 12.12.1978. Date of accident is 07.09.2015. As such age of deceased on the date of accident was near about 37 years. Further, having considered the age of the deceased as 37 years the multiplier of 15 can be applied as per the case of Smt.Sarla Verma and others Vs. Delhi Transport Corporation and another cited supra. 23]As there is no fixed income of the deceased therefore, I do not think fit to add 30% income towards future prospects. Hence, I declined accordingly. 24] Therefore, the claimants are entitled to Rs.6,48,000/­ towards of loss of dependency i.e. Rs.4,500/­ x 12 months = Rs.54,000/­ per annum x 15 multiplier = Rs.8,10,000/­ 1/5th deduction Rs.1,62,000/­ = Rs.6,48,000/­. Rinadevi & ors. Vs. Ambadas & ors. 13 Judgment – MACP No.756/2015 25]Now as per the case of Asha Verman & ors. Vs. Maharaj Singh & ors. reported in 2015 CJ(SC) 223 under the head of non­pecuniary damages the following amounts can be granted as follows :­ 1]Funeral expenses Rs.25,000/­ 2]Loss of estate Rs.1,00,000/­ 3]Loss of consortium (claimant no.1 – wife)Rs.1,00,000/­ 4]Loss of love and affection (minor children – Claimant Nos.2 to 5 Rs.1,00,000/­ each)Rs.4,00,000/­ 5]Loss of love and affection (parents of deceased – Respondent Nos.3 & 4 – Rs.50,000/­ each).Rs.1,00,000/­ Total Rs.7,25,000/­ As such the claimants and Respondent Nos.3 and 4 are entitled to Rs.6,48,000/­ towards loss of dependency and Rs.7,25,000/­ towards non­pecuniary damages, total Rs.13,73,000/­ towards compensation amount. 26] Moreover, in view of the judgment of Asha Verman & ors. Vs. Maharaj Singh & ors. cited supra 9% interest on the compensation amount can be awarded. Hence, I award 9% interest on the compensation amount from the date of filing of petition till its realization. In the circumstances I answered issue nos.2 and 3 accordingly. 14 AS TO ISSUE NO.4 :­ 27]In view of the finding to the issue nos.1 to 3, the claim of the claimants deserves to be allowed partly with proportionate costs and with 9% interest as against Respondent Nos.1 and 2 only. I hold that, Respondent Nos.1 and 2 – insured and insurer are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation amount to claimants and Respondent Nos.3 and 4 (parents of the deceased) and lastly I proceed to pass the following order :­ ORDER 1]Claim of the claimants is allowed partly with proportionate costs. 2]Both Respondent Nos.1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation amount of Rs.13,73,000/­ (Rupees Thirteen Lakhs Seventy­ Three Thousand only) to the claimants and Respondent Nos.3 and 4 with 9% interest from the date of filing of this claim petition i.e. 26.10.2015 till its full realization, including NFL amount of Rs.50,000/­. 3]After depositing the amount, it be apportioned as under :­ Claimant No.1 ­Rs.5,73,000/­ Claimant Nos.2 to 5 ­Rs.1,50,000/­ each Respondent Nos.3 & 4 ­Rs.1,00,000/­ each. Rinadevi & ors. Vs. Ambadas & ors. 15 Judgment – MACP No.756/2015 Out of amount of claimant no.1, an amount of Rs.2,00,000/­ be invested in fixed deposit scheme of any nationalized bank for a period of three years and rest of amount of Rs.3,73,000/­ be given to her by account payee cheque. Further, claimant nos.2 and 3 being minor daughters of deceased and claimant no.1, their amounts be invested in fixed deposit scheme of any nationalized bank till their attaining of age of majority or fixation of their marriage, whichever is earlier. Further, amounts of claimant nos.4 and 5 being minor sons of deceased and claimant no.1, their amounts be invested in fixed deposit scheme of any nationalized bank till their attaining of age of majority and its interest be credited to the account of claimant no.1 quarterly. Further, amounts of Respondent Nos.3 and 4 be paid by account pay cheques only. 4]Award be prepared accordingly. Sd/­ [A.R.

The said accident occurred on Karmad to Jaipur road. At that time, a minor daughter of claimant Tatyarao Mate namely Shivani Mate was proceeding from her school was met with an accident. The offending vehicle Tata Magic bearing No. MH­15­DM­0982 was involved in the accident. Respondent no. 2 Appa Damodhar Kapate was owner and driver of the said vehicle. Offending vehicle was insured with respondent no. 1 vide policy No. 16040031140100015768 from the period from 07/05/2015 to 3 MACP 790/2015 08/02/2016. 5]In an accident, minor girl Shivani Mate had suffered injuries to her head, jaw and to the teeth of upper side. Her some teeth of lower side have also been fallen and she sustained fracture to the jaw and further her face was disfigured therefore, she was operated. Her Treating doctor was Abaji Sonwane also medically treated her in Seth Nandlal Dhoot Hospital, Aurangabad. The injured victim Shivani Mate was admitted in above said hospital from 29/09/2015 till 05/10/2015. As such, the father of the victim had incurred Rs. 1,00,000/­ towards her medical treatment and Rs. 2,00,000/­ towards medicine bills etc. On the date of accident, the driver and owner of the offending vehicle was rash and negligent. Due to his rash and negligent act alleged accident had taken place. 6]Accordingly, crime bearing Cr.No. 199/2015 has been registered against respondent no. 2 under section 279, 337 and 338 of I.P.C. Due to injuries sustained by the victim/injured, she had suffered permanent disability. As such, claimant has claimed Rs. 13,50,000/­ total compensation amount but she has restricted her claim to the tune of Rs. 2,00,000/­ as compensation amount with interest @ 18% p.a. and submitted to allow the claim. 4 MACP 790/2015 7]According to her, both respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation as there was contract between the insurer and respondent insurance company and the company has to indemnify the loss or damage to the respondent no. 2. 8]Respondent no. 1 insurance company has filed written statement vide Exh. 16 in detail. According to insurance company, claim itself is false and not maintainable and denied each and everything. Respondent insurance company has denied allegations about rash and negligent driving of the respondent no. 2 i.e. owner and driver of the offending vehicle. Respondent insurance company has also denied about medical and hospital expenses as claimed by the Claimant. Respondent insurance company has admitted that, the vehicle in question was Tata Magic bearing No. MH­15­DM­982 and was duly insured with respondent no. 1. According to insurance company an accident in question took place due to rash and negligent act of the claimant herself, as her parents are also negligent as they allowed victim to move on road. As such, respondent insurance company is not at all liable to pay compensation and claim deserves to be dismissed. Lastly submitted for dismissal of claim. 9]Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and pleadings of both side, I have framed issues at exh.18 which 5 MACP 790/2015 are being reproduced as follows, I record my findings with reasons thereon as follows :­ Sr. No.ISSUES FINDINGS 1]Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the motor vehicle No. MH­15­DM­0982 driven by respondent No. 2 ?

Further, it is not in dispute that, the offending vehicle is insured with respondent no.1 vide policy of 6 MACP 790/2015 insurance (Exh. 18) for the period from 07/05/2015 to 08/02/2016.

It is also not in dispute that, an accident had taken place and in this regard there are police papers i.e. FIR (Exh. 14), Spot panchanama (Exh. 15) etc. In this case dispute is of rash and negligent driving at the hands of respondent no. 2 Appa Damodhar Kapate and second point about compensation amount including medical expenses etc. AS TO ISSUE NO. 1 :­ 12]So as to prove the claim, in support of claim petition, claimant has lead evidence of witness no. 1 Tatyarao Mate (Exh. 13) who is guardian of injured. Admittedly, crime came to be registered against respondent no.2 Appa Damodhar Kapate. FIR vide Exh. 15 is complaint of the father of Shivani i.e. Tatyarao Anna Mate. No doubt, from the oral evidence of witness No. 1 Tatyarao Mate, is supported by police case papers i.e. FIR (Exh. 14) and spot panchanama (Exh. 15). It goes to prove that, respondent no. 2 Appa Damodhar Kapate was rash and negligent while driving offending vehicle on the date of an accident on the road. Moreover, an adverse inference can also be drawn against Appa Damodhar Kapate under section 114 of the Evidence Act and 7 MACP 790/2015 it is presumed that, respondent no. 2 Appa Kapate had committed an act of rash and negligent driving of offending vehicle on the date of an accident. He himself is not defending the case. He himself did not file his written statement to deny allegations of rash and negligent driving of his offending vehicle. Moreover, there is no evidence of respondent side in rebuttal to defend his allegations about rash and negligent driving. As such, issue No. 1 is proved. Hence I answer in affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO. 2 :­ 13]This issue is in respect of permanent disability due to injuries suffered by victim Shivani. However in the instant case the documents i.e. police case papers, the medico legal certificate (Exh. 17), oral evidence of claimant Shivani Mate goes to prove that the victim Shivani Tatyarao Mate five years old has sustained injuries in an accident. Medico legal certificate Exh. 17 shows victim injured Shivani has sustained 1)CLW (2 x 1/2 c.m.) at upper lip 2) CLW (3 x 1 c.m. At occipital region, 3) CLW (1 x 1 c.m.) at Chin, 4) Abrasion over right leg, 5) # Fracture Mandible, 6) Dental Trauma C.T. Brain ­ Within Normal Limits.

Certificate is dated 29/09/2015. 8 MACP 790/2015 14]In the circumstances, it is proved that claimant Shivani Tatyarao Mate five years old daughter of Tatyarao Mate suffered injuries in an accident. As such, even though, there is no permanent disability certificate on record, it is proved that, victim has suffered injuries in an accident and a such, I answered this issue No. 2 as victim Shivani sustained injuries in an accident. AS TO ISSUE NOS. 3 to 5 :­ 15]During the course of argument learned counsel Shri Khedkar for claimant has argued that, even though there is no permanent disability certificate on record the claimant/victim is entitled for compensation amount towards medical bills. Learned counsel Shri Barlota/Duranni vehemently argued that, claimant is not at all entitled for claiming compensation amount as there is no permanent disability suffered by victim. As there is no medical evidence to prove that claimant has suffered permanent disability and any type of injury. 16]However, present case is nothing but a summary inquiry trial and from the M.L.C. (Exh. 17), it is crystal clear, certainly victim/injured Shivani Mate sustained injuries. However, there is supporting oral evidence of witness No. 2 Dnyaneshwar Pawar, the Accountant in Seth Nandlal Dhoot Hospital, Aurangabad (Exh. 22) and there is hospital bill vide Exh. 23 which 9 MACP 790/2015 goes to prove that, claimant is entitled for Rs. 86,889/­ and as per oral evidence of witness No. 3 for claimant Shri Dnyaneshwar Maroti Rathod (Exh. 25) and medical bills vide Exh. 26 the claimant further entitled for Rs. 2,610/­. Moreover, from the L.M.C. certificate vide Exh. 17, it reveals that, the injured was admitted in hospital from 29/09/2015 and in the oral evidence of Dnyaneshwar Pawar (Exh. 22) the Accountant of the Seth Nandlal Dhoot Hospital, it has come on record that injured minor girl Shivani was admitted in hospital for the period from 29/09/2915 till 05/10/2015 (Exh. 23) for medical treatment and as such from this it can be presumed that, parents of minor girl were also engaged with injured minor daughter for medical treatment and care and during that period certainly there might be loss of income of parents of the injured. Thereafter, to compensate parents of the victim for the loss of income and pain and sufferings of Rs. 5,000/­ would be reasonable amount. 17]As such, claim petition deserves to be allowed accordingly and claimant is entitled to get this much amount i.e. (Rs. 86,889 +2,610 (medical bills) +Rs. 5,000/­ (Pain and Sufferings) = 94,499/­ (Rs. Ninety Four Thousand, Four Hundred and Ninety Nine Only). The vehicle involved in this case is duly 10 MACP 790/2015 insured with respondent no. 1 and the vehicle is owned by respondent no.2, as such both respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation amount to the claimant with interest @ of 9% p.a. from the date of filing of this petition till its full realization. Therefore, issue nos. 3 and 4 are proved at all and I answer the same in affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO. 5 :­ 18]In view of findings given to aforesaid issues, the claim petition deserves to be allowed with proportionate costs against respondent nos. 1 and 2. Both respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation amount of Rs. 94,499/­.

The said accident occurred on Karmad to Jaipur road. At that time, a minor daughter of claimant Tatyarao Mate namely Shivani Mate was proceeding from her school was met with an accident. The offending vehicle Tata Magic bearing No. MH­15­DM­0982 was involved in the accident. Respondent no. 2 Appa Damodhar Kapate was owner and driver of the said vehicle. Offending vehicle was insured with respondent no. 1 vide policy No. 16040031140100015768 from the period from 07/05/2015 to 3 MACP 790/2015 08/02/2016. 5]In an accident, minor girl Shivani Mate had suffered injuries to her head, jaw and to the teeth of upper side. Her some teeth of lower side have also been fallen and she sustained fracture to the jaw and further her face was disfigured therefore, she was operated. Her Treating doctor was Abaji Sonwane also medically treated her in Seth Nandlal Dhoot Hospital, Aurangabad. The injured victim Shivani Mate was admitted in above said hospital from 29/09/2015 till 05/10/2015. As such, the father of the victim had incurred Rs. 1,00,000/­ towards her medical treatment and Rs. 2,00,000/­ towards medicine bills etc. On the date of accident, the driver and owner of the offending vehicle was rash and negligent. Due to his rash and negligent act alleged accident had taken place. 6]Accordingly, crime bearing Cr.No. 199/2015 has been registered against respondent no. 2 under section 279, 337 and 338 of I.P.C. Due to injuries sustained by the victim/injured, she had suffered permanent disability. As such, claimant has claimed Rs. 13,50,000/­ total compensation amount but she has restricted her claim to the tune of Rs. 2,00,000/­ as compensation amount with interest @ 18% p.a. and submitted to allow the claim. 4 MACP 790/2015 7]According to her, both respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation as there was contract between the insurer and respondent insurance company and the company has to indemnify the loss or damage to the respondent no. 2. 8]Respondent no. 1 insurance company has filed written statement vide Exh. 16 in detail. According to insurance company, claim itself is false and not maintainable and denied each and everything. Respondent insurance company has denied allegations about rash and negligent driving of the respondent no. 2 i.e. owner and driver of the offending vehicle. Respondent insurance company has also denied about medical and hospital expenses as claimed by the Claimant. Respondent insurance company has admitted that, the vehicle in question was Tata Magic bearing No. MH­15­DM­982 and was duly insured with respondent no. 1. According to insurance company an accident in question took place due to rash and negligent act of the claimant herself, as her parents are also negligent as they allowed victim to move on road. As such, respondent insurance company is not at all liable to pay compensation and claim deserves to be dismissed. Lastly submitted for dismissal of claim. 9]Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and pleadings of both side, I have framed issues at exh.18 which 5 MACP 790/2015 are being reproduced as follows, I record my findings with reasons thereon as follows :­ Sr. No.ISSUES FINDINGS 1]Whether the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the motor vehicle No. MH­15­DM­0982 driven by respondent No. 2 ?

As per final order. 4]Who is liable to pay compensation ? As per final order 5]What order ? As per final order. R E A S O N S 10] Heard argument of learned counsel Shri D.A. Khedkar for claimant and learned counsel Shri AS Barlota for respondent no. 1 at length. Respondent respondent no.2 appeared but failed to file his say. 11] It is not in dispute that, the offending vehicle bearing No. MH­15­DM­0982 is owned and driven by respondent no. 2 Appa Damodhar Kapate. Further, it is not in dispute that, the offending vehicle is insured with respondent no.1 vide policy of 6 MACP 790/2015 insurance (Exh. 18) for the period from 07/05/2015 to 08/02/2016.

J U D G M E N T [ Pronounced on 17th March, 2018 ] The present petition is filed under Section 163­A of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 for compensation, in respect of unfortunate death of Sudhakar Naibrao Gawhad R/o Telegaon, Tq. Bhokardan, District Jalna who died in motor vehicle accident held on 06.09.2014. The claimant No.1 is wife of deceased, claimant No.2 & 3 are minor children and claimant No.4 is father of deceased Sudhakar Naibrao Gawhad. 2.Brief facts of the case­ It is the case of claimants that on 06.09.2014 at about 18.30 hours the deceased was proceeding on motorcycle bearing registration No.MH­21­AL­ 6268 from Sillod to Aurangabad. When he reached on Aurangabad Sillod road, the said motorcycle colluded with another motorcycle bearing registration No.MH­23­R­1587 because of which accident occurred. The deceased sustained grievous injuries in said accident and succumbed to said injuries on 07.09.2014. 3.The claimants further contended that on the basis of report lodged by Krushna Bhaurao Varpe, Wadod Bazar Police station registered Crime bearing 3 M.A.C.P.No.788/2015, [ Judgment ]. No.I­113/2014 against the drivers of both motorcycles. 4.The claimants further contended that the deceased was Karta of their family. He was earning Rs.3,000/­ per month. They further contended that at the relevant time, the respondent No.1 was owner of motorcycle bearing registration No.MH­21­AL­6268 on which the deceased was travelling. The motorcycle was insured with respondent No.2. Therefore, respondent No.1 and 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the claimants. Thus, the claimants have claimed total compensation to the tune of Rs.4,00,000/­ including compensation under other conventional heads. 5.Respondent No.1 failed to file written statement. Hence, claim proceeded without written statement against respondent No.1. 6.Respondent No.2 filed their written statement at Exh­13. They contended that the accident has occurred because of rash and negligent driving of deceased himself and Crime is also registered against the deceased. They further contended that claim petition is not maintainable under Section 163­A as it is settled position of law that in case if driver is owner of motor vehicle, the owner himself could not be recipient of compensation as the liability to pay compensation is on him. They further submitted that in the present case, the deceased was not owner of motorcycle bearing registration No.MH­21­AL­6268. He has borrowed it from respondent No.1. Therefore he has stepped in the shoes 4 M.A.C.P.No.788/2015, [ Judgment ]. of owner. They further denied the age, income of the deceased and submitted that the petition be rejected. 7.From the rival pleadings of the parties, I have framed following issues at Exh­14 and I answer them for the reasons stated below. I S S U E S F I N D I N G S 1.Whether the claimants prove that deceased Sudhakar Naibrao Gawhad died in a motor accident on 6.9.2014 ? .. Yes. 1­A.Whether the claimants prove that deceased Sudhakar Naibrao Gawhad died in motor accident on 06.09.2014 held between motorcycle bearing registration No.MH­23­R­1587 and motorcycle bearing registration No. MH­21­AL­6268 ? .. Yes. 2.Whether claimants are entitle for compensation ? If yes, from whom and its quantum ? .. No. 3.What order and award ? .. The claim is dismissed. R E A S O N S 8.In order to substantiate the contentions raised in the petition, claimant No.1 examined herself at Exh­15 and relied upon the relevant police papers pertaining to the accident. They are Form Comp.AA at Exh­22, FIR at Exh­23, Spot Panchanama at Exh­24, Inquest Panchanama at Exh­25, Post­ mortem Report at Exh­25­A and filed evidence close Pursis at Exh­27. 5 M.A.C.P.No.788/2015, [ Judgment ]. 9.Respondent No.1 failed to adduce evidence. Hence his evidence was closed vide order dated 06.03.2017. 10.Respondent No.2 examined Milind Arjunrao Sasane as RW1 at Exh­30. Nazir Khan Niyamat Khan as RW2 at Exh­35, Dhirendra as RW3 at Exh­38 and relied upon following documents. Authority Letter issued by R.T.O. at Exh­31, Certificate issued by R.T.O., Aurangabad at Exh­32, Certificate issued by R.T.O., Jalna at Exh­36 and Insurance Policy at Exh­39 and filed evidence close Pursis at Exh­40. As to Issue No.1 & 1­A : 11.CW1 has deposed that the accident took place due to use of vehicle bearing registration No.MH­21­AL­6268 owned by respondent No.1. Perusal of FIR at Exh­23, it appears that the accident has occurred because of rash and negligent driving of both the drivers of motorcycle. They have collided with each other and the accident has occurred. The charge­sheet produced by the claimants below Exh­18 shows that the offence is registered against the drivers of both the vehicles. The post­mortem report filed by the claimants at Exh­25­A shows that the deceased has died due to multiple injuries sustained in motor vehicle accident. Therefore, I answer Issue No.1 & 1­A as 'Yes'. As to Issue No.2 : 12.The Learned advocate appearing for the claimants submitted that it 6 M.A.C.P.No.788/2015, [ Judgment ]. is well settled law that negligency is not the relevant factor in petition filed under Section 163­A of Motor Vehicle Act. The said provision is special provision for payment of compensation on structural formula basis and as per amendment in Section 163­A in the year 1994, claimants are dispensed with proof of negligency and compensation should be determined on the structured formula basis. He further submitted that under Section 163­A of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988 following facts should be proved. (1) Whether accident has occurred, (2) Whether accident occurred with motor vehicle, (3) Resultant consequence i.e. injury or death, (4) Annual income should be below Rs.40,000/­ and (5) Neligence is irrelevant. 13.He further submitted that vehicle which was driven by the deceased was owned by respondent No.1 and the same was insured with respondent No.2, at the time of accident. Therefore, respondent No.1 & 2 are jointly and severally liable to pay compensation to the claimants and relied upon the judgment passed by Hon'ble Himachal Pradesh High Court in New India Assurance Company Ltd. Vs Ms. Shivali Devi d/o Vijay Kumar & Ors. reported in 2016(6) ALL M.R.(Journal) 1. 14.The Learned advocate appearing for respondent submitted that claimants have not proved that the deceased was agent or driver of respondent No.1. It is admitted fact that he borrowed the said motorcycle from respondent 7 M.A.C.P.No.788/2015, [ Judgment ]. No.1. Therefore, the deceased cannot be held to be employee of the owner of motorcycle although he was authorized to drive the vehicle by its owner. Therefore, he is placed into the shoes of owner of motorcycle. Accordingly, legal representatives of deceased who have stepped into the shoes of owner of motor cycle, could not claim compensation under Section 163­A of Motor Vehicle Act, 1988. He further submitted that the Insurance Company by examining the officer of R.T.O., Aurangabad as well as Jalna as RW1 & RW2 has proved that the deceased was not having valid and effective driving license to drive motorcycle, at the time of accident. He further submitted that the respondents have examined their administrative officer as RW3 and has proved the policy and one of the terms of policy is that the driver of the motor vehicle should possess valid and effective driving license, at the time of accident. He further submitted that therefore, the present petition is not maintainable and should be dismissed. 15.CW1 in her entire evidence has not stated that in what capacity the deceased was travelling on the motorcycle. In cross examination, she has admitted that the motorcycle was used by her husband. Respondent No.1 is not related to her neither he was related to respondent No.1. In the entire evidence, it does not appear that the deceased was driving the motorcycle in the capacity as agent or employee of respondent No.1. In the authority relied by the claimants, the owner of the vehicle has filed affidavit stating that her husband was working 8 M.A.C.P.No.788/2015, [ Judgment ]. with her as driver and her evidence has gone unchallenged and, therefore, the Hon'ble High Court has granted compensation to the legal representatives of deceased. In the present case, the respondent No.1 has not stepped into witness­ box to show in what position, he has given the motorcycle to the deceased. Therefore, the authority relied by the claimants is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present case. 16.The respondent No.2 has relied on the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court passed in Ningamma and Another Vs United India Insurance Co. Ltd., AIR 2009 Supreme Court 3056 in which it is held that ""if it is proved that the driver is the owner of the motor vehicle in that case, the owner could not himself be recipient of compensation as the liability to pay the same is on him. This proposition is absolutely clear on reading of Section 163­A"" of Motor Vehicle Act. 17.It is settled position of Law that the owner of motorcycle cannot be recipient of compensation under Section 163­A of Motor Vehicle Act. In the instant case, the deceased was not the owner of vehicle in question. He borrowed the said motorcycle from its real owner. It has not came in evidence in what capacity he was driving the said motorcycle. Therefore, it cannot be said that he was employee of owner of motorcycle though the owner has authorized him to drive the vehicle. Therefore, the deceased stepped into the shoe of owner of 9 M.A.C.P.No.788/2015, [ Judgment ]. motorcycle. Accordingly, the legal representatives of deceased who have stepped into the shoe of owner of motor vehicle could not claim compensation under Section 163­A . Therefore, I answer Issue No.2 as 'No' and proceed to pass following order. O R D E R The claim petition is dismissed.

No response from learned counsel Shri A.S. More for Respondent Nos.1 and 2 at the time of final argument. Perused the record and proceeding carefully. AS TO ISSUE NO.1 :­ 12]In order to establish the claim, claimant has examined Aminabi Vs. Feroz Khan & Oths. 7 Judgment­ MACP No. 634/2015 herself as witness no.1 at exh.23 and also led evidence of her second witness PW2 Dr.Sachin Surendra Bedmutha at exh.35. 13]Claimant relied on the documents – certified copies of chargesheet (exh.26), spot panchanama (exh.27), copies of FIR (exh.28), driving licence of respondent No.1 (exh.29), RC book of offending vehicle (exh.30), insurance policy (exh.31), AA Form (exh.32), discharge card (exh.33) and permanent disability certificate (exh.36). 14]Claimant has filed evidence close purshis vide exh.37. No oral evidence on behalf of respondents side on record. 15]Claimant has filed on record the copy of her aadhar card below list exh.45 in which the year of birth is mentioned as 1985. Evidence of claimant is testified. 16]From the police case papers it reveals that, the accident has taken place on 20.04.2015 when the claimant was traveling by Auto­rickshaw No.MH­20­AA­5198 and the offending vehicle – Car No. MH­20­AG­4591 has given the dash to said rickshaw and claimant had sustained the injuries. Aminabi Vs. Feroz Khan & Oths. 8 Judgment­ MACP No. 634/2015 17]From the oral evidence of claimant – PW1 and the police case papers on record, chargesheet vide exh.26, spot panchanama exh.27, FIR exh.28 and Form Comp.AA exh.32, it is evident that, the offending vehicle – Car No. MH­20­AG­4591 is involved in an accident and the driver of the offending vehicle – Respondent No.1 – Feroz Khan was on the date of accident. 18]Claimant led oral and documentary evidence in support of her claim just to prove the fact that, Respondent No.1 was rash and negligent while driving the offending vehicle on the date of accident. Due to this the accident occurred and claimant sustained the injuries in an accident. However, Respondent Nos.1 to 3 did not step into the witness box to deny the allegations about the rash and negligent driving at the hands of Respondent No.1 – Feroz Khan. They have filed the written statement on record vide exh.16 but did not take pains to step into the witness box to deny the allegations about the rash and negligent driving and about the occurrence of the accident. Hence, I answer issue no.1 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NO.2 :­ 19]Claimant – Aminabi w/o Ilyas Quraishi deposed that, Aminabi Vs. Feroz Khan & Oths. 9 Judgment­ MACP No. 634/2015 she has sustained permanent disability due to the injuries suffered by her in the said accident. Just to prove the permanent disability she has adduced evidence of her second witness Dr.Sachin Bedmutha at exh.35, who deposed that, as per permanent disability certificate exh.36, the claimant has sustained 21% permanent disability. Dr.Sachin Bedmutha also deposed that, he examined claimant clinically and radiologically and after going through the old case papers he found that, claimant Aminabi w/o Ilyas Quraishi had fracture femur right side, for which she was operated at Government Medical College and Hospital, Aurangabad, with k­nail. Due to her injuries she had right hip gross movement restriction and right knee terminal movement restriction. So according to the McBride scale he issued her disability certificate to the extent of 21% permanent disability vide certificate exh.36. 20]From the record it is crystal clear that, claimant was admitted to G.M.C. Hospital, Aurangabad vide discharge card exh.33, which reveals that, she was admitted on 21.04.2015 and discharged on 06.05.2015. As such I hold that, claimant has sustained permanent disability due to the injuries suffered by her in an accident to the extent of 21%, as deposed by Dr.Sachin Aminabi Vs. Feroz Khan & Oths. 10 Judgment­ MACP No. 634/2015 Bedmutha. Therefore, I answer issue no.2 in the affirmative. AS TO ISSUE NOS.3 TO 5 :­ 21]Upon careful scanning the oral and documentary evidence as led by the claimant, it is evident that, the accident has taken place in which the claimant Aminabi w/o Ilyas Quraishi meet with an accident and sustained permanent disability to the extent of 21%. However, nature of her injury is fracture Mid Shaft femure right side hip dislocation vide discharge card exh.33 and permanent disability certificate exh.36. However, there is fracture injury sustained by the claimant. 22]It is pertinent to note that, as per the discharge card exh.33 claimant was only admitted from 21.04.2015 to 06.05.2015 and she has not taken any medical treatment in any other hospital after discharge and no document to that extent is on record. 23]In the circumstances to some extent also claimant has also sustained the permanent disability and she has suffered the injuries in an accident i.e. due to accident being suffered the injuries. Aminabi Vs. Feroz Khan & Oths. 11 Judgment­ MACP No. 634/2015 24]Now so as to determine the loss of income, I have gone through the pleading and evidence on record. Claimant appears to be housewife and she has specifically come up with a case that, she was doing the business of Beautician and running Beauty Parlour and getting income of Rs.10,000/­ per month. But, no proof of Beauty Parlour. 25]However, presuming that, she is Beautician, due to fracture injury i.e. fracture femur right side, etc. there is no loss of income in future. She may do her business as a sitting job. Further, as there is no fixed income being housewife and hence, no loss of future prospects. 26]Therefore, in the circumstances as I find that, in fact, there was fracture injury to the claimant and there is no medical expenses and by short period of admission in the hospital from 21.04.2015 to 06.05.2015 as her right hip gross movement restriction, etc. and considering the facts and circumstances and evidence on record, an amount of Rs.1,75,000/­ as a lump­sum compensation amount would be just and reasonable towards pain and suffering, agony, diet, attendant charges, in­conveyance caused transportation charges, diet, etc. Aminabi Vs. Feroz Khan & Oths. 12 Judgment­ MACP No. 634/2015 27]As per the verdict of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Smt.Neeta w/o Kallappa Kadolkar and others Vs. The Divisional Manager, MSRTC, Kolhapur, 2015(1) T.A.C. 340 (S.C.), I award 9% interest on the compensation amount. 28]No doubt, the offending vehicle is owned by Respondent No.2, Respondent No.3 is the policy holder of offending vehicle, Respondent No.1 is the driver of offending vehicle No. MH­20­Ag­4591 and Respondent No.4 is the insurance company of the offending vehicle with whom the offending vehicle was insured vide insurance policy exh.31 for the period from 24.06.2014 to 23.06.2015 and the accident has taken place on 20.04.2015. Therefore, the insurance policy covers the claim, accident and risk. In the circumstances all the respondent nos.1 to 4 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation amount to the claimant. 29]Therefore, the claim deserves to be allowed accordingly with proportionate costs as against all respondents. All respondents are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation amount to the claimant. In the circumstances I answer issue nos.3 and 4 in the affirmative accordingly and Aminabi Vs. Feroz Khan & Oths. 13 Judgment­ MACP No. 634/2015 proceed to pass following order :­ ORDER 1]The claim of the claimant is hereby allowed partly with proportionate costs as follows:­ 2]All Respondent Nos.1 to 4 are jointly and severally liable to pay the compensation amount of Rs.1,75,000/­ (Rupees One Lakh Seventy­Five Thosuand only) to the claimant with 9% interest from the date of filing of this claim petition i.e. 19.09.2015 till its realization, including NFL amount of Rs.25,000/­, by account payee cheque. 3]Award be prepared accordingly.

Due to this the accident occurred and claimant sustained the injuries in an accident. However, Respondent Nos.1 to 3 did not step into the witness box to deny the allegations about the rash and negligent driving at the hands of Respondent No.1 – Feroz Khan.

Hospital, Aurangabad vide discharge card exh.33, which reveals that, she was admitted on 21.04.2015 and discharged on 06.05.2015.

However, nature of her injury is fracture Mid Shaft femure right side hip dislocation vide discharge card exh.33 and permanent disability certificate exh.36.

Aminabi Vs. Feroz Khan & Oths. 11 Judgment­ MACP No. 634/2015 24]Now so as to determine the loss of income, I have gone through the pleading and evidence on record. Claimant appears to be housewife and she has specifically come up with a case that, she was doing the business of Beautician and running Beauty Parlour and getting income of Rs.10,000/­ per month. But, no proof of Beauty Parlour. 25]However, presuming that, she is Beautician, due to fracture injury i.e. fracture femur right side, etc. there is no loss of income in future. She may do her business as a sitting job. Further, as there is no fixed income being housewife and hence, no loss of future prospects. 26]Therefore, in the circumstances as I find that, in fact, there was fracture injury to the claimant and there is no medical expenses and by short period of admission in the hospital from 21.04.2015 to 06.05.2015 as her right hip gross movement restriction, etc. and considering the facts and circumstances and evidence on record, an amount of Rs.1,75,000/­ as a lump­sum compensation amount would be just and reasonable towards pain and suffering, agony, diet, attendant charges, in­conveyance caused transportation charges, diet, etc. Aminabi Vs.
